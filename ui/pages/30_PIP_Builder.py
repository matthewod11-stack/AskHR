Draft a formal Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) in Markdown for employee \"{emp_name}\" (role: {role}), managed by \"{manager}\".

Requirements:
- Duration: {duration}. Include a clear start date placeholder and an end date placeholder.
- Structure with headings: Summary, Areas of Concern, SMART Expectations, Timeline & Milestones, Check-ins ({checkins}), Support & Resources, Consequences, Acknowledgement & Signatures.
- Use bullet lists and numbered milestones where appropriate.
- Write in a pragmatic, compliance-aware CPO tone.
- If sources are provided below, ground claims and process steps with bracketed citations like [1][2]; otherwise state that no sources were found.
- Preserve neutrality and avoid legal conclusions.

Inputs (free text provided by manager):
- Areas of concern: {issues}
- SMART expectations: {expectations}
- Support/resources: {support}
- Consequences: {consequences}

Deliver only the PIP markdown body (no preamble).
