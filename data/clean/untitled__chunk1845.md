# The Psychoses

Psychoanalytic theory was least developed in the matter of the major psychoses, especially schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder. However, the central theme of psychoana- lytic thinking about the psychoses, and the schizophrenias in particular, determined that they arise from a massive failure of repression of unconscious material.

From this perspective, schizophrenia symptoms are like dream-material intruding into and controlling consciousness in the waking state. Freud referred to psychosis as a waking dream. The central difference between the neuroses and the psychoses, according to Freud, was that the neurotic did not deny the existence of reality, whereas the psychotic did deny reality and tried to substitute something else for it.

Freud’s extensive modiﬁcations were manufactured in order to shore up the suppositions from which the theory had originated. And for more than a hundred years, analysts in- doctrinated with Freudian theory or its various modiﬁcations directed the course of therapy to the elucidation of childhood erotic fantasies and wishes. Freud elaborated his psychoana- lytic theory, publishing extensively, until his death in 1939. Freud died in London, where he had moved from Vienna after the U.S. government intervened with the German Nazi government to permit him to do so.
