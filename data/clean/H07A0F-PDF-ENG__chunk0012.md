We argue that a major reason for stalled progress in leadership

representation is the inequitable way leadership development

opportunities are allocated in many organizations. When informal

means are used to select employees for opportunities like mentorship,

leadership coaching or other high-potential programs it’s all too likely

that our biases about who has potential (according to research: tall,

attractive, white, men) come into play. Since leadership development

opportunities tend to beget other opportunities, the problem of

inequitable selection compounds over time.

By primarily relying on informal feedback, organizations are impeding

their ability to make the best decisions about who may beneﬁt from

powerful development programs. Research also suggests approaching

selection in this way limits their potential impact. In their new

book, Getting to Diversity, for example, professors Frank Dobbin and

Alexandra Kalev write, “mentoring has the biggest payoﬀ for the

people who aren’t on the executive’s radar.” They share the example

of Sun Microsystems, which found giving mentors to “non-star workers”

resulted in the biggest performance improvements.
