- 6. What emerging trends should we be mindful of and potentially capitalize on?

Your manager has conversations you’re not privy to about internal

shifts, industry changes, and executive concerns. They sit in closed-

door meetings, see ﬁnancial projections early, and hear market threats

months before they go public. Their answer gives you a sneak peek

into what might shape their motivation and choices in the weeks and

months to come. When shifts happen, you’ll understand why and be

ready to adapt.

- 7. Can you help me understand how [project or task] compares to other tasks on my plate?

This question tells you a lot about your manager’s decision-making

process, including why certain priorities rise to the top while others

get put on the back burner. When you need to set boundaries, you can

reﬂect their own logic back to them. Instead of simply saying, “I’m at

capacity,” you can say, “You mentioned the product launch should be

our main focus, which means I’ll need to deprioritize [new request] to

give it the attention it deserves.” Plus, you’re making them aware of your

bandwidth without sounding like you’re complaining.

Pay attention to what your boss doesn’t say as well. Notice which topics

they get excited about, they hesitate to discuss, and when their tone

shifts. Observation is often just as important as inquiry.
