Look for people both within your team and in other departmentswho have a wealth of knowledge and experience. For instance, isthere a team member at your level who’s been around longer andwho can provide you with guidance? Is there an executive whosecareer path you admire and who could become a potentialmentor? Is there a colleague in another department whose workoverlaps with your own, and whom you could learn from?The goal is to choose people who have expertise that can help younavigate the culture, adjust to your new role, and eventually,identify opportunities for growth and development. While youwon’t connect on a personal level with everyone, you may end upbuilding a deeper camaraderie with a few.Pro tip: Write down a list of five people (other than your manager)who you want to connect with and invite them to an introductorymeeting.
