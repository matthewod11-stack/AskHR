## example of the latter: Its culture of radical transparency and trust

encourages managers to only hire people whom they feel they can

really trust, and to whom they can therefore feel comfortable giving

example, its business development director in Brazil was given the

authority to sign contracts and agreements on behalf of Netﬂix without

These three questions can help you determine how much autonomy

to provide your international teams — but of course, ﬁguring this

out is just the ﬁrst step. The next step is to develop a plan to actually implement these diﬀerent levels and types of autonomy around the world. That means working with diﬀerent departments to

specify exactly where and how autonomy should be granted, and then

making sure that information is clearly documented and communicated
