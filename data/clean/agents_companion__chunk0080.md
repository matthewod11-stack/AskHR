# Assessing Agent Capabilities

Before evaluating your specific agentic use cases, publicly available benchmarks and

technical reports can provide insight into core capabilities and limitations to consider when

building out your agentic use cases. Public benchmarks exist for most fundamental agentic

capabilities like model performance, hallucinations, tool calling and planning. For example,

tool calling, the ability to select and use appropriate tools, is demonstrated by benchmarks

like the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL)16 and Ï„-bench17 that also outlines

common mistakes. Another example, PlanBench18 aims to assess planning and reasoning,
