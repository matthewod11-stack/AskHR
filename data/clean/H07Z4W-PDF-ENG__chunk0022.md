# hybrid work schedule.

If you’re not in any of these scenarios, then consider using data

to propose common days and times for in-oﬃce and remote work.

According to Pew Research Center, approximately 59% of hybrid

workers say they work remotely three or more days in a typical week,

while 41% say they work remotely two days or less per week. Tuesday to

Thursday are the most common in-oﬃce days, with Monday and Friday

being the most common work-from-home days.
