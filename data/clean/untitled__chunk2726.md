# Treating Ethnic Minority Clients 501

During 1999, ﬁve ethnic minorities assumed ofﬁce as pres- ident of their divisions, with all four ethnic minority groups represented. In addition to Bingham, Sue, and Vasquez, Steven James, a NativeAmerican, accepted the presidency of the Psychology of Religion and Siang-Yang Tan, an Asian American,becamepresidentoftheSocietyfor thePsycholog- ical Study of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Issues.

In 1996, there were 11 ethnic minority persons holding ofﬁce in a Division (excluding Division 45, the Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minorities, which would be expected to have elected ethnic minorities). By 1999, the count increased to 26—a 136% increase. By 2000, the num- bers expanded to 51.

Regarding APA standing Boards and Committees, the number of ethnic minorities increased from 18 in 1996 to 43 in 1999 for a 139% increase. By 2000, the number increased even further to 54. An observation was made of the contrast between the Planning Committee members and the photo- graphs on the wall of the APA board of directors, which were nearly all white persons.At the 1998APAmeetings in Boston, the presidents of the four autonomous ethnic minority psycho- logicalassociations—AsianAmericanPsychologicalAssocia- tion, Association of Black Psychologists, National Hispanic PsychologicalAssociation, Society of Indian Psychologists— werepresenttoreceivePresidentialCitationsrecognizingtheir associations’contributions to ethnic minority agendas.
