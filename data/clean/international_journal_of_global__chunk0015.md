Several researchers have been conducted different studies in the past decades, however succession planning has been adopted formerly in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Few empirical studies of research have been done in between 1959 to 1960. The most relevant study in succession planning and management in the 1970s (Mehrabani & Mohamad, 2011). The most relevant only study during 1970 to 1979 was about manpower planning (Coleman, 1970).

Succession planning gained great attention for formal succession planning which involves management development and CEO Succession (Kesner & Sebora, 1994; Zaich, 1986). A survey done was to examine management succession planning development (Sharma & Agarwal, 2016). Previous researchers in 1980s focused on succession frequency associates with CEO succession (Kim, 2010). The need and advantage of succession planning, leadership pipeline concept was defined by (Charan et al., 2010). The study of Mehrabani & Mohamad (2011) identified the necessity of succession planning. The research in this period expanded to different sectors such as higher institutes, government agencies, health sector, and non-profit organizations.

Seven-pointed star model was developed to achieve a systematic succession planning and management (Rothwell, 2011). Assessment of the role of succession planning in corporations and its effect on women's promotions (Stroud, 2005). The study of Succession planning in healthcare organizations examines how the healthcare organizations identify the potential leaders, to address succession plan, retain employees and prepare for workforce diversity (Shipman, 2007). The study of Mandi (2008) introduced some indicators for succession planning, including the ability to identify new leaders and sustain core competencies.

Some researchers focused on some others succession planning best practices. The study of Deshwal (2015) emphasises the transparency of succession plan based on individual roles rather than jobs. Many organizations discuss succession planning only when they need to replace some personnel. The study of (Deshwal, 2015) suggested best practice of external hiring for a need of new blood in the organization. Replacing employees and not developing them has become a big and common mistake by organizations in developing and developed nations (Olatunji et al., 2017). Managers need to consider an individual backup plans for short to long-term absences as well as permanent departs (Laratta et al., 2018). The current Study of Payne et al., (2018) shows that conducting annual talent reviews are important for assessing and ensuring a deep pool of internal talent (Bano et al., 2022). It can be accomplished by finding out the key leaders, competencies development, knowledge capture and monitoring, and metrics evaluation. It would result in effective succession plan as well as retain operational stability.
