# A Taxonomy of Leadership Responses

We’ve observed six common responses to activist issues, ranging from

oblivious to proactive. As you read this list, consider various activist

issues in your organization — and how your leadership team reacted.

- Nonexistent (“Activism? What activism?”): Leaders are oblivious to

quash voices either through directives that certain subjects are not

up for discussion or by making it clear (explicitly or implicitly) that if

employees speak up they will face negative consequences.

- Facadism (“Let’s just say the right thing”): Leaders respond with
