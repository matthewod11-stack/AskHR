Change management is therefore a complex task, which not only starts at different levels, but must bring together in a constructive manner the most diverse interests of those involved. In this respect, knowing the potential causes of failure is as important as knowing the factors which contribute to its success (Lauer, 2021, p.8).

Managers have to deal with four main areas of change: strategy, structure, technology and people (figure no. 2). Strategy change means a change in the manner in which managers ensure company success. Structure change includes any modification of the variable structures, such as reporting relationships, coordination mechanisms, employee skills or job reconfiguration. Technology change includes “changes in the working manner or methods and the equipment used”. People change refers to “changes in individual or group attitudes, expectations, perceptions and behaviours” (Robbins et al, 2018, p.213).

A classification of changes, of high importance for change management, is from the perspective of the types of events that generate the need for change. Based on these types of events, there are three main categories of change (Kinicki & Williams, 2020; Brisson-Banks, 2010):

“closed change”: there is certainty as to what has happened, the causes and the measures to be taken; “contained change”: there is reasonably certain knowledge of what has happened, the causes and the measures to be taken; “open-ended change”: there is broad disagreement as to what has happened, the causes and the measures to be taken.
