## Under dialogic communication and participation, unexpected reactions to a

change process would not promptly be seen as resistance. In fact, responses are

recognized as “expressions that are informed by what was said previously and what is

happening currently”, without the negative label of representing a threat to what has

been agreed before. Really influencing change is later an essential indicator of a

dialogic communication. When carried out under dialogic communication “change

initiatives would be open to change as they were implemented.” (Jabri, Adrian et al.,

2008: 680).

That defines a proposed dimension to dialogic communication that was created

by the author of this research, called Input Use: if through the input collected during

communication effort the “change initiatives were open to change as they were

implemented” (Jabri, Adrian et al. 2008: 680)

If one considers that resistance does not come only from recipients but also from

agents (Ford and Ford, 1995; Ford, Ford et al., 2008; Ford and Ford, 2009), and if

agents do not truly receive and incorporate counter arguments into the content and

process of change, then participation is not happening. In such cases, it is just voicing

or considering participants as objects, which means it is monologic participation.

Unfolding from the latest arguments, it is inferable that not all participation would

minimize resistance as largely prescribed, but monologic participation could in fact lead
