## HBR / Digital Article / 4 Warning Signs of Ethical Burnout on Your Team

Rather than simply saying something dismissive like “I did consider

you for it, and decided Rick was the better option” and leaving it at that, she decided to engage her team member diﬀerently. She prompted,

“Tell me how you’re interpreting my giving the assignment to Rick.”

As Sue suspected, her team member saw it as a reﬂection of their own

shortcoming. Having that out on the table, Sue said:

My decision was simply about giving Rick a chance to shine. You’ve

had ample opportunities this year, and you already know you’re

one of our top performers. That level of success can’t be sustained

indeﬁnitely, and sometimes it’s ok to dial it back. I’m looking at your

long-term success, not just this year’s. I need you to learn that your

colleagues need chances to succeed as well and that your job is to

support them, not compare yourself to them.

Sue got the outcome she hoped for: Instead of withholding support from

Rick, her high performer rallied around him, sharing key client insights

and market data that were pivotal to Rick’s success — and that only they

had.

When you rely too heavily on your top performers, their dopamine

rushes and adrenaline hangovers can lead to unhealthy risk-taking

when trying to keep a track-record going. That degree of single-

mindedness can accelerate ethical burnout. As was the case with Sue,

showing that success can be celebrated without ratcheting up every

new goal is critical. Keep your highest performers grounded in integrity,

without the need to always be on the rise.

Ethical burnout often begins with what looks like benign stressors.

And that’s the best time to confront them head-on. The spectacular
