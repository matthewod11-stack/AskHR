## What Happens When Performance Management Is Implemented Poorly?

One example of a poorly implemented performance management system resulted in a $1.2 million lawsuit. A female employee was promoted several times and succeeded in the construction industry until she started working under the supervision of a new manager. She stated in her lawsuit that once she was promoted and reported to the new manager, the boss ignored her and did not give her the same support or opportunities for training that her male colleagues received. After eight months of receiving no feedback from her manager, she was called into his office, where the manager told her that she was failing, resulting in a demotion and a $20,000 reduction in her annual salary. When she won her sex-discrimination lawsuit, a jury awarded her $1.2 million in emotional distress and economic damages.24

Is the system more closely aligned with some of the positive consequences listed in Table 1.1 or more closely aligned with some of the negative consequences listed in Table 1.2?

One of the purposes of a performance management system is to make decisions about employeesâ€™ compensation (e.g., pay raises). For many employees, this is perhaps one of the most meaningful consequences of a performance management system. Chapter 10 provides a detailed discussion of how a performance management system is used to allocate rewards. However, here we will discuss some basic features of reward systems and the extent to which the allocation of various types of rewards is dependent on the performance management system.
