As can be seen from Table 1, the industrial sample (Sample 1) was mainly composed of males (75.8 %) while the service sample (Sample 2) was mainly composed by females (69.9 %). Concerning tenure with the company and in the position, both samples were highly heterogeneous with standard deviations almost as high as the mean values, suggesting an even distribution of new and old employees.

Concerning sales experience, both samples also showed high mean values (11.69 and 15.03 years) suggesting a group of experienced employees. However, high standard deviation values also suggest a very heterogeneous sample, covering a broad range of experienced and inexperienced individuals.

5.2 Reliability and validity of measuring scales

Confirmatory factor analysis was used to estimate the properties of the measurement model, which was estimated by restricting each scaleâ€™s item loading on its a priori specified factor, and allowing free correlation among factors (Gerbing and Anderson, 1988). All standard regression weights were higher than .60 so all items from the original scales were retained. Final factor loadings and reliabilities are showed in Table 2.
