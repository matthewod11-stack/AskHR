## Distinguishing Performance Management Systems from Performance Appraisal Systems

What are the differences between a performance appraisal system and a performance management system? How are the two systems related to each other? After answering these questions, consider the following 11 criticisms. Which of the following criticisms pertain to performance appraisal systems but not to performance management systems? Which criti- cisms pertain to both performance appraisal and performance management systems? Use Xs on the table below to denote answers. Then, provide an explanation for categorizing the 11 criticisms in the way you did.

Criticism 1: “[There can be] inconsistency between comments and scores on an employee’s evaluation.”

Criticism 2: “The annual performance review is a bad management tool. To start with, it is not timely. If your subordinate is deficient in some ways, you wait 11

months to say something about it. How does that help next week’s performance?”

Criticism 3: “Never make the evaluation a hit-and-run. It should take the form of a dialogue between the supervi- sor and subordinate, not an isolated event but rather a part of performance/career management more generally.”

Criticism 4: “A number of years ago, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) created a ‘Like Me’ task force. Its general conclusion—there was a human tendency to favor employees who are like the managers making the employment assessment.”

Criticism 5: “Few managers jump with glee at appraisal time. When they triage workplace demands, many times appraisals end up at the bottom. As a result, late appraisals are often the norm and not the exception.”
