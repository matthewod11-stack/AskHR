# RESEARCH METHOD

Measurement model We used validated scales in a different context than the original use, and we performed an EFA and a conﬁrmatory factor analysis on the should theoretically that observed variables comprise latent constructs, with both analyses yielding passing levels of model ﬁt, reliability and validity (CMIN/DF=1.94, CFI=0.89, NFI=0.79, RMSEA=0.07, PCLOSE=0.000, StandardizedRMR=0.086,χ2=1170.9,Degrees of freedom=603). Normality of the composite variables for each of the constructs (calculated using factor scores from the measurement model in AMOS) passed tests for skewness and kurtosis, but the proﬁtability performance score was slightly skewed (2.20) and exhibited moderate kurtosis (4.49). We believe that these low levels are not problematic in our analysis. In addressing common method bias, we use multiple sources of data for our model, therefore it is less likely that common method bias will impact our results.

after adding the mediating variable; second, we conducted bootstrapping using 2000 bias- second corrected approach allowed us to determine the strength and signiﬁcance of the standardized indirect effect of (Baron the mediated relationships and Kenny, 1986; Preacher and Hayes, 2004). To best understand a surprising relationship, we ran a multiple regression analysis between the factors of TTP and proﬁtability ﬁrst-order performance, and found that the quality factor, representing the area of compliance, had a dominative negative impact, outweighing the positive impact of skills and innovation. Therefore, we consider TTP to be almost exclusively reﬂective of the team’s attention to compliance quality. The means, standard deviations and correlations of variables are reported in Table 6. We ﬁnd that board member characteristics are strong antecedents to board-level outcomes, which are signiﬁ- cantly related to ﬁrm performance. Overall, we had a stronger
