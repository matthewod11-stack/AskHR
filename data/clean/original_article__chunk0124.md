than typical predictive model of corporate proﬁtability (R2=0.20) exceeding the most recent preva- lent R2 (ranging from 0.07 to 0.16) of other recent academic works using proﬁtability as a dependent variable (Ali Shah, 2009; Gill et al, 2010; Gill and Obradovich, 2012). In addition, we observed fairly strong Squared Multiple Correlations (R2) for TTP (0.70) and TP (0.44), presented in Table 7.

Structural model We tested our hypotheses using structural equation modeling employing IBM SPSS and AMOS software version 20. We tested the hypothesized model and then eliminated non- signiﬁcant relationships in order to achieve adequate model ﬁt. We appropriately co-varied the residual errors for TP and TTP (Bateman et al, 2002; Hare, 2003; Kenny, 2003; Collins and Parker, 2010). Thus, we were able to account for their statistical correlation, without implying theoretical causation. We employed to test mediation: ﬁrst, we two approaches took the Baron and Kenny (1986) approach in which we tested changes to the direct effect

We had excellent model ﬁt (CMIN/DF= 1.29, CFI=0.988, NFI=0.949, RMSEA= 0.04, PCLOSE=0.636, Standardized RMR= 0.0571, χ2=32.21, Degrees of freedom=25). In terms of the validity and reliability of our latent constructs, we found no concerns (that is, AVE>0.50, CR>0.70, MSV<AVE and √AVE>inter-construct correlations).

RESULTS The results of our analyses are presented in both Figure 2 and Table 8. These two representa- tions provide a summary of our ﬁndings for each hypothesis tested.
