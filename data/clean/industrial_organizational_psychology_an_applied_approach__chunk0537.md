# CIT = Critical Incident Technique.

excellent and poor performance ignores routine duties. Th us, the CIT cannot be used as the sole method of job analysis.

Job Components Inventory. In addition to information about tools and equipment used on the job, which were discussed earlier, the JCI also provides information about the perceptual, physical, mathematical, communication, decision making, and responsibility skills needed to perform the job.

Threshold Traits Analysis. An approach similar to the JCI is the Th reshold Traits Analysis (TTA), which was developed by Lopez, Kesselman, and Lopez (). Th is method is available only by hiring a particular consulting ﬁ rm (Lopez and Associates), but its unique style makes it worthy of mentioning. Th e TTA ques- tionnaire’s  items identify the traits that are necessary for the successful perfor- mance of a job. Th e  items cover ﬁ ve trait categories: physical, mental, learned, motivational, and social. An example of an item from the TTA can be found in Figure .. Th e TTA’s greatest advantages are that it is short and reliable and can correctly identify important traits (Lopez et al., ). Th e TTA’s greatest dis- advantage is that it is not available commercially. Because the TTA also focuses on traits, its main uses are in the development of an employee selection system or a career plan (Lopez, Rockmore, & Kesselman, ).

Fleishman Job Analysis Survey. Based on more than  years of research (Fleishman & Reilly, a), the Fleishman Job Analysis Survey (F-JAS) requires incumbents or job analysts to view a series of abilities such as the one shown in Figure . and to rate the level of ability needed to perform the job. Th ese ratings are performed for each of the  abilities and knowledge. Th e F-JAS is easy to use by incum- bents or trained analysts, and is supported by years of research. Its advantages over TTA are that it is more detailed and is commercially available.

Job Adaptability Inventory. Th e Job Adaptability Inventory (JAI) is a -item inven- tory developed by Pulakos, Arad, Donovan, and Plamondon () that taps the
