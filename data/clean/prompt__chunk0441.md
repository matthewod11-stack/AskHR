For few-shot prompting with classi(cid:341)cation tasks, mix up the classes

Generally speaking, the order of your few-shots examples should not ma(cid:459)er much. However,

when doing classi(cid:450)cation tasks, make sure you mix up the possible response classes in the

few shot examples. This is because you might otherwise be ove(cid:455)i(cid:459)ing to the speci(cid:450)c order of

the examples. By mixing up the possible response classes, you can ensure that the model is learning to identify the key features of each class, rather than simply memorizing the order of

the examples. This will lead to more robust and generalizable pe(cid:455)ormance on unseen data.
