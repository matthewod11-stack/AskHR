## The Past, Present, and Future of Dynamic Performance Research

observations or the spacing between observations differ, such models cannot be estimated with LGCM (Raudenbush, 2001). (Note, however, that I will discuss below missing data techniques that may ultimately allow LGCM to use unbalanced data.)

While the requirement of equal within-subjects error covariance matrices limits the nature of the type of data that can be analyzed with LGCM, the approach allows for far greater sophistication with regard to modeling the error structure. The relationship between the errors associated with the separate observations of job performance can be modeled in a variety of ways. The simplest approach is to assume that the residuals are independent.

The residuals would then have the following pattern:
