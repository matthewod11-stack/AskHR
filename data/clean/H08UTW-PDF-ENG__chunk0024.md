## Though norms around “yes” and “no” vary across cultures and

hierarchies, the following phrases reﬂect the most common blocking

language I’ve observed in U.S. workplaces:

- “Yes, but…” (sounds polite, but dismisses the idea)

- “Yes, or…” (swaps out the original idea for the speaker’s idea)

- Saying “Yes, and…” when actually meaning “Yes, but…” or “Yes, or…”
