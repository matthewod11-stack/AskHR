## (the letter of the law, but not the spirit)

- “No” (when it shuts down the person and the idea without

explanation; especially damaging when interrupting the speaker)

- “That’s not valid” or “That doesn’t apply here” (dismisses the value of

the other person’s idea or denies their experience)

How to avoid this mistake:

“Yes” shouldn’t become a polite preface for shutting down an idea (“yes,

but…”) or pushing your own agenda (“yes, or…”). Similarly, don’t use

“yes, and…” if you’re just paying lip service to the concept. Speaking the words without a genuine intent to aﬃrm and engage with other’s ideas

rings hollow—and worse, can come across as manipulative.
