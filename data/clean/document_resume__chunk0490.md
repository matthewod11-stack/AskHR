# Edith A. Miller

The development of an appropriate performance appraisal procedure and its accompanying criteria is a complex set of tasks. While there is a vast body of theory and research related to performance appraisal methodology, there is also an equally extensive and widely differing range of opinion, research, and suggestion in the litera- ture regarding not only performance appraisal generally but also criterion development specifically. While there is no concensus regarding the right or best instrument or the roest appropriate criterion, it is clear that whatever form a performance appraisal system takes it must be:

- 1. Conceptually or philosophically congruent with the job, profession, or con- stellation of duties and responsibilities it is designed to appraise.

- 2. Directly related to the actual day-to-day. on-the-job, performance of these duties and responsibilities.

- 3. Usable and legally defensible.

- 4. A source of information for improvement (growth) of the individual being assessed as well as improvement or added benefits for the institution or orga- nization in which the individual is employed.

- 5. Sound from a measurement point-of-view--that is, valid and reliable.

The first four charactenstics herein listed are deafly related to a cogent under- standing of the job or position to be appraised Klasson. Thompson, and Luben outlined four important qualities a performance appraisal system must int.lude to be defensible.
