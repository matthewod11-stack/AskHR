China. Increasing the representation of women in the leadership ranks should be a clear priority for Juno.

We know John’s view, but I’d sug - gest that Alex and Jackie arrange for a few other regional leaders to meet with both candidates. I took that approach when recently hiring team members in Asia-Paciﬁc and the Middle East. Local employees described how disconnected they’d felt from decisions made at headquarters, so it was important to get their buy-in before making the ﬁnal call. I believe that we earned their trust and loyalty as a result.

Another way to decide between two

equally qualiﬁed candidates is to go back to the criteria you established for the role and hold yourself accountable to them. Ideally, Juno has a struc- tured hiring process in place, and my informed guess is that Catherine has more of the attributes necessary for success in the role than Nolan does. Adhering to the criteria will prevent Alex, Jackie, John, and the board from letting bias creep in and falling back on what they know.

Finally, if Catherine is hired, Alex, Jackie, and the board need to commit to doing what it takes to set her up for success. That includes having candid conversations about what it means for a Chinese-American woman to ﬁll this role and what it will take for the organi- zation to accept and embrace her as a leader. The interview process will have given them ideas about areas in which she can and should grow, including lan- guage skills and cultural understanding. What will they do to ensure that she is welcomed, supported, and respected as a new leader?

Equity is not just about hiring people

from underrepresented groups. It’s also about creating a sense of inclusion and belonging for them and reducing barriers so that they thrive in the jobs you’ve put them in. That’s how Cather- ine—and future Catherines—will make a diﬀerence at Juno.

YUTING WANG is the head of people and culture for Hong Kong and Macau at Roche.

If Juno’s goal is to win in Asia—or, more precisely, in mainland China—my advice is to hire Nolan. I understand why Alex is reluctant to appoint another white man, given the diﬃculty Juno has with diversity. But in my personal view, Nolan is the better choice.
