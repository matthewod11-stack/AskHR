# Situations and Creating Learning States

Despite this lack of a taxonomy, the meta-analytic results of Colquitt et al. (2000) did show that measures of other situational characteristics, such as level of supervisory support, peer support, and a positive work climate, were positively related to measures of individual motivation to learn, learning, and training transfer. The assumption behind this correlational research is that climate fac- tors such as support create a stronger situational press than less supportive supervisors and that this support tends to lead to more effective training and work behaviors. Correlational research can- not rule out the converse explanation: those who more effectively apply trained skills to the job tend to experience or perceive greater supervisory and peer support.

Two sets of studies speak to strategies for enhancing learning states and creating “strong situations” that minimize the effects of individual differences on learning outcomes. One set of studies has focused on employee choice. Baldwin, Magjuka, and Loher (1991) found that giving individuals a choice about what training to at- tend can create a positive learning state—if individuals obtain their ﬁrst choice, that is. Similarly, Hicks and Klimoski (1987) found that trainees given a choice of attending a training program tended to report higher levels of motivation, were more positive about the program, and received higher test scores during training than those not given a choice. These studies on individual choice and outcomes of choice indicate that justice perceptions may bear im- portant relationships with the structure of the training environ- ment, and much recent research in personnel selection on justice may have some bearing on this (compare Bauer, Maertz, Dolan, & Campion, 1998; Ryan & Ployhart, 2000).

A second set of experimental studies has focused on positively framing the training situation for the trainee. Martocchio (1992) attempted to create a learning state by framing microcomputer training as an opportunity for career advancement rather than as a punishment for past mistakes. He found that the career opportu-
