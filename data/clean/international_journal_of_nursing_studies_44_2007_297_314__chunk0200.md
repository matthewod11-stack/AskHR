This review set out to assess the components of job satisfaction most inﬂuential on intent to leave for nurses working with adults in ward environments. In addition to identifying these components, an exploration of how the sources of job satisfaction may have changed over time was undertaken. The results suggest that although many of the same factors are being assessed within scales, a more appropriate and relevant approach may be to assess each environment individually. Scales, whilst useful tools for comparability, need to evolve within the nursing profession for maximum effective- ness. If to be used as a means for implementing policy change and improving the working lives of nurses, it is essential that scales generate speciﬁc and accurate data. When the aim is improvement of job satisfaction for nurses, the conclusions made from this study point strongly toward the need for analysis at ward level. As differing results are found across work environments, more appropriate techniques such as qualitative inter- views or action research may be employed to gain detailed insight into which components are of impor- tance to particular workforces. This could be under- taken ward-wide, for policy change at NHS Trust level, as a nation-wide policy may not be apt given the discrepancies shown.
