## solutions and greater engagement in organizational ecosystems.

Design thinkers tend to start the innovation process by focusing on

the customer’s problem, and breakthrough thinkers often start with

the idea. But systems thinkers start by zooming out to understand

the system that the innovation will be part of before they zoom in

to solve the problem. That approach can lead to nonobvious answers. When facing the problem of traﬃc congestion, for example, a design

thinker might widen or add roads. A breakthrough thinker might deploy

technology to dynamically reroute drivers. A systems thinker would

eschew those short-term solutions, realizing that making it easier to

drive would result in a perverse incentive for people to drive more. The

systems thinker might choose the counterintuitive solution of making traﬃc move even more slowly while increasing public transportation
