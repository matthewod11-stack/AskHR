## Challenges Faced by Disabled Individuals in AI-driven Hiring

Disabled job seekers already experience higher unemployment rates (7.2% ) compared to non -disabled individuals (3.5%), and AI hiring exacerbates these disparities ( Persons with a Disability , n.d.). The literature highlights five major challenges:

- Bias in AI Resume Screening: AI algorithms often penalize employment gaps, ignoring disability- - related medical absences or caregiving responsibili Monedero et al., 2020; Vogel et al., 2024).

Inaccessible AI Video Interviews: Platforms like HireVue, which analyze facial expressions, tone, and speech patterns, unfairly disadvantage candidat (Ajunwa, 2021; Kelly-Lyth, 2021). While some companies claim to improve accessibility, there is little external validation of whether adjustments effectively mitigate bias (Sheard, 2022).
