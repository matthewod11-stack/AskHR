# Overview of AI in Hiring Systems

The integration of AI in recruitment promises efficiency and objectivi screening, video interviews, and gamified assessments (Hocken & King, 2023; Kam merer, 2022; Sonderling et al., 2022). However, scholars argue reliance on historical data and biased algorithmic design may reinforce discrimination against marginalized groups like disabled individuals (Kaminski, 2023).

A parallel trend is the increasing use of generativ to automate tasks, le this technology including resume screening, job descriptions, and candidate communication. Whi improves workflow efficiency, it raises new equity concerns â€”access to AI-generated job materials is unequal, and biases embedded in training data may propagate through AI -generated hiring decisions (Farrell, 2023; Marshall et al., 2024). Additionally, job descriptions generated by AI risk excluding disabled candidates if they reinforce ableist language or assumptions, potentially violating the ADA.
