says Salinas. Ground yourself with a breathing technique to calm your

nerves. Be ready for resistance, too, says Wilding. If your boss responds

with, “You’re trying to undermine me,” or guilt-trips you with, “I

thought you were a team player,” she recommends ﬂipping it. Respond

with, “I am a team player, that’s why I’m bringing this up. I want us to

be as productive as possible.” If they say, “I thought you were behind

me,” reassure them: “I am behind you, that’s why I want you to have this

information in order to make the strongest decision.” Make it clear that

your feedback is meant to support, not undermine.
