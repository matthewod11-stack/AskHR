# Employment-at-Will Doctrine

In the United States, there is a big difference between terminating an employee in the public sector and terminating an employee in the private sector. In the private sector, the employment-at-will doctrine in most states allows employers freedom to fire an employee without a reason—at will. In the public sector, an employee can be fired only for cause.

Though employment-at-will is common in the United States, countries such as France enforce the restriction that no employee can be fired unless it is for cause.
