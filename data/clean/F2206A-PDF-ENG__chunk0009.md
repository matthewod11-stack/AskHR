## HBR / Magazine Article / Revitalizing Culture in the World of Hybrid Work

- 3. Shift from optimizing corporate culture to fostering microcultures.

Multinationals have long faced the challenge of creating a strong

corporate culture while also allowing local microcultures to thrive.

With hybrid work splintering workforces into more-autonomous

cells, all companies must now strike that balance. The research

suggests that leaders should favor somewhat devolved control:

Survey respondents reported that team-level experiences increased

connectedness substantially more than enterprisewide initiatives did.

Royal DSM, a Dutch health and nutrition company, now treats the

culture as a ﬂotilla of independently piloted ships rather than a single

tanker. “The company provides the ﬂotilla with guidance to sail in

the right direction, but it does not prescribe the norms and behaviors

aboard each boat,” the researchers write.

. . .

The pandemic has radically changed how employees experience

corporate culture, and ﬁrms must embrace the new reality. “By relying

less on osmosis to drive connectedness and more on intentionality,” the

researchers write, “leaders will see outsized impact on performance and

intent to stay.”
