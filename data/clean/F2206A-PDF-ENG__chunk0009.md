## HBR / Magazine Article / Revitalizing Culture in the World of Hybrid Work

- 2. Connect through emotional proximity, not physical proximity.

The view that in-oﬃce interactions sustain culture confuses physical

proximity with the more important sensation of emotional proximity,

the researchers argue. “Physical proximity is being in the same space

as another individual—being seen,” they write. “Emotional proximity

is being of importance to others—feeling seen.” One survey showed

that emotional proximity increased employees’ connectedness to their

workplace culture by 27%, while physical proximity had no impact.

Because remote and hybrid employees have fewer workplace

interactions, each exchange makes a stronger impact. That heightens

the imperative to identify and remove toxic workers, especially those

in positions of inﬂuence. It also means that companies should refrain

from requiring people to attend meetings unless they’re truly needed.

The more employees feel that their contributions are valuable, the more

connected to the culture they become.

Finally, leaders can create moments of emotional proximity by helping

remote employees see how their work connects to the company

mission. TBS, a pharmaceutical company based in Japan, uses role-

play techniques during virtual onboarding to help people build an

emotional connection to the ﬁrm from the start. New hires are assigned

a medical condition that can be treated by a TBS drug and are asked

to behave as a patient would. Someone assigned a gastrointestinal

disorder, for example, would be pinged frequently for a bathroom break,

thus simulating the inconvenience and discomfort patients endure. New employees also interview patients about how TBS oﬀerings have

improved their quality of life. It’s not about heaping praise on people,

says Cambon. “It’s about ensuring that employees understand the value

of their work to the organization and beyond.”
