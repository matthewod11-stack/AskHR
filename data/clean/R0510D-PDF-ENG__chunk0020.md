Most companies have ambitious plans for growth. Few ever realize them. In their book Proﬁt from the Core, Chris Zook and James Allen report that between 1988 and 1998, seven out of eight companies in a global sam- ple of 1,854 large corporations failed to achieve proﬁtable growth. That is, these com- panies were unable to deliver 5.5% annual real growth in revenues and earnings while earn- ing their cost of capital (a rather modest hur- dle). Yet 90% of the companies in the study had developed detailed strategic plans with much higher targets.

Why is there such a persistent gap between ambition and performance? The gap arises, we believe, from a disconnect in most companies between strategy formulation and strategy exe- cution. Our research reveals that, on average, 95% of a company’s employees are unaware of, or do not understand, its strategy. If the em- ployees who are closest to customers and who operate processes that create value are un- aware of the strategy, they surely cannot help the organization implement it effectively.

It doesn’t have to be like this. For the past 15 years, we have studied companies that have achieved performance breakthroughs by adopting the Balanced Scorecard and its associ- ated tools to help them better communicate strategy to their employees and to guide and monitor the execution of that strategy. (For background on the Balanced Scorecard, see The Strategy-Focused Organization, our book Harvard Business School Press, 2000.)

Some companies, of course, have achieved better and longer-lasting improvements than others. The organizations that have managed to sustain their strategy focus have typically es- tablished a new unit at the corporate level to ofﬁce oversee all strategy related activities, an of strategy management

(OSM), as we call it.

This might appear to be nothing more than a new name for the familiar strategic planning unit. But the two are quite different. The typi- cal planning function facilitates the annual strategic planning process but takes little or no leadership role in seeing that the strategy gets executed. The companies we studied, however,
