## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Redefine Our Gendered Idea of “Ambition”

A case in point: We coach a woman whose colleague recently told her,

“I realize you never talk about your kids, and that’s really cool.” The

comment hit our client like a ton of bricks. She realized that, in order

to succeed at work, she had calculated that it was easier to connect with

her colleagues if she didn’t talk about her children — a realization that

shocked her.

They offer high-quality feedback.

Women tend to receive less actionable feedback than men from their

supervisors. Less direction from managers means fewer opportunities

to learn, which can sap work of dynamic growth opportunities. As one

of our clients recently told us, “I see feedback as an investment in me,

because my manager sees the potential for me to grow. They’re giving

me feedback because they see that I can do something with it.” Robust

feedback allows women to grow within their roles, even if they have

temporarily stepped oﬀ the promotion track. It is a crucial retention

tool for managers who want to encourage high-performing women with

beneﬁts that are not only practical but psychological.
