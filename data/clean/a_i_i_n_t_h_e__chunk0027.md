# With Indeed sending over 20 million messages a month to job seekers—and 350 million visitors coming to the site every month—these increases scale up to signi(cid:14)cant business impactG

But scaling up also meant using more tokens. To increase e(cid:8)ciency, OpenAI and IndeedC worked together to (cid:13)ne-tune a smaller GPT model that was able to deliver similar resultsC with 60% fewer tokens.B

Helping job seekers (cid:13)nd the right jobs—and understanding why a given opportunity is right for them—is a profoundly human outcome. Indeed's team has used AI to help connect more peopleC to jobs, faster—a win for everyone.

We see a lot of opportunity to continue to invest^ in this new infrastructure in ways that will help^ us grow revenue.
