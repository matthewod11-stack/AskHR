# characteristics of a strategy framework.

. . .

When executives present strategy, they often do so with the aid of

visuals, particularly PowerPoint decks. But they need to understand

how much the design of their slides matters. Strategies are the

key mechanism through which people coordinate and create value.

Communicating them well—with the right visualizations—allows

everyone to travel the business landscape in tandem rather than work

in isolation. A well-designed visualization could easily double the

stock market’s reaction to a strategy, immediately adding tens, even

hundreds, of millions of dollars to a company’s market value. And it can

have a far bigger impact on the long-term performance of the employees

tasked with implementing the strategy.
