## HBR / Digital Article / To Become a Better Presenter, Look Inward

- The future self, who sees that this presentation is not a career-making

moment, and who can put the whole experience into perspective.

You can also tap into these selves prior to presenting by making sure

you know the topic inside and out, practicing in front of friends, and

reminding yourself that this presentation will likely not make or break

your career. By actively choosing the beliefs and behaviors of a diﬀerent

self from your portfolio, you can embody an identity you already have

within you, and show up with greater conﬁdence.

Tell yourself a different story.

Many of the professionals I work with are more intimidated by the

anxiety-inducing stories they make up about presentations than they

are about the facts themselves. For example, I work with many

nonnative English speakers who need to present in English. They often

report that they feel less intelligent in English-speaking setting, that

nobody understands their accent, or that the cultural divide is too wide

for others to really get them.

When working with these clients, we start by separating the fact (“I’m

presenting in my nonnative language”) from the story that causes the

anguish. The story might sound like this: “Because I’m presenting

in my nonnative language, I’m hard to understand. And if I’m hard

to understand, people won’t pay attention. And if people won’t pay

attention, then I won’t be seen as inﬂuential. If I’m not seen as

inﬂuential, then I won’t add value … which means I’ll lose my job …

which means I won’t have income … which means I won’t be able to

support my family … which means I will lose the respect of my family”
