# Basic Provisions/Requirements

The LMRDA consists of seven titles

Title I, the "Bill of Rights," sets forth certain basic rights that Congress believed Federal law should guarantee to union members. These rights are set forth under the "Employee Rights" section below.

Members may enforce these rights through private suit in Federal district court. (Note: Federal-sector union

members can bring a complaint to OLMS.) The Secretary of Labor also has enforcement responsibilities

with regard to an employee's right to receive and inspect a collective bargaining agreement.

Title II requires unions to ﬁle an information report (Form LM-1), copies of their constitution and bylaws,

and annual ﬁnancial reports (Form LM-2, LM-3, or LM-4) with OLMS. The reports and documents ﬁled with

OLMS are public information, and any person may examine them or obtain copies at OLMS oﬃces.

Oﬃcers and employees of unions must ﬁle a Form LM-30 with OLMS if they have any loans or beneﬁts from, or certain ﬁnancial interests in, employers whose employees their union represents and businesses

that deal with their union. Employers who enter into such an agreement or engage in certain speciﬁed

activities or ﬁnancial dealings with their employees, union, union oﬃcers, or labor relations consultants

must ﬁle a Form LM-10.

Labor relations consultants, who enter into an agreement with an employer to persuade employees about their union activities, or to supply certain information to the employer, must ﬁle a Form LM-20,
