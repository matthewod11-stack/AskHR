# Low level

line would follow a set of procedures in assembling a product but would decide whether the quality of the assembled product was good enough. Likewise, a sec- retary might type a report the way it was submitted by his boss but would be responsible for ensuring that there were no typographical errors.

In essence, this level removes what psychologist Rick Jacobs () calls “redundant systems.” With a redundant human system, every person’s work is checked by another person. In some organizations, a single piece of work might even be checked by several different people. The logic behind redundant systems is that with more than one person checking quality, there is less chance of a poor- quality product reaching a consumer. Furthermore, in many cases, an employee might not have the skill level necessary to check her own work. For example, a secretary might well be an excellent typist but might not have the grammatical skills to know whether her memos contain mistakes. Even if she did have the skills, we have all missed typos because we knew what we wanted to say and thus proofread a sentence the way we meant to say it rather than the way we actually wrote it.

Though redundant systems make sense in many cases, they do have their drawbacks. The most relevant of these to this chapter is that satisfaction, moti- vation, and performance are often lessened when others check our work. Let me provide you with a prime example. At my university, graduate students must submit a program of studies covering the courses they intend to take during their two years in graduate school. The student completes the program form, signs it, and then gets his advisor to sign it. The advisor must then get

his department chair to sign the form, and the department chair must then get the graduate dean to sign the form. Now keep in mind that because  of our  classes are required and thus standard for all industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology graduate students, theoretically there should be little room for error in choosing courses. However, as an advisor, I often see mistakes made by my students, who then tell me that they didn’t bother to read the catalog because they figured that I would catch their mistakes. The problem is that I seldom read the forms because I figure that if there are any mistakes, my department chair will catch them. She never reads the forms because she figures that the dean will catch them. Thus, the very redundant system designed to prevent errors is actually the cause of errors!

As one can imagine, making employees responsible for their own output does a number of things. It motivates employees to check their work more care- fully, provides them with a sense of “ownership” in their product, and provides a greater sense of autonomy and independence. In the Saturn division of General Motors, employees receive feedback on problems that drivers encounter with the cars assembled by a particular group of employees. This feedback helps employ- ees gauge their quality control efforts, and it affects the size of their bonus.

Advisory At the advisory level, employees are asked to provide feedback, suggestions, and input into a variety of organizational concerns. The key at this level is that there is no guarantee that an organization will follow the advice given by the employees; the only guarantee is that the organization will seriously consider the advice.

The idea behind this level is that employees often have the best knowledge about their jobs, so getting their input makes good business sense. As previously discussed, though employees often have the knowledge to make a decision, they are placed at an advisory level because they may not have the “motivation” to make the best decision. In such situations, an organization will ask employees for their opinions and preferences to better understand the employees’ positions but will reserve the right to make the actual decision.

Shared/Participative/Team The fourth level of employee input and control allows an employee to make a decision. However, this decision is made at a group level. For example, an organi- zation might put a team together to find better ways to market its projects or to determine what type of benefits package employees will receive. This level differs from the previous level (advisory) in that only in very rare circumstances will the team’s decision not be implemented. At this level, employees must not only be well trained in decision making but also be willing to take on the responsibility of making decisions.

Absolute The final level of employee input and control gives an employee the absolute authority to make a decision on his own—no group consensus, no supervisory approval. It is important to point out, however, that he is also responsible for the consequences of that decision. So if he makes the wrong decision, he may be reprimanded or fired. Because of these potential consequences, many employees are leery about being given absolute power. Thus, it is important in many circum- stances to remove the potential for a negative sanction.
