# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 113

Campbell et al. (1993) and Motowidlo et al. (1997) models were combined, revised, and expanded to more completely explain the process by which individual differences in personality traits lead to individual differences in speciﬁc dimensions of performance. This model can be used to guide research linking speciﬁc personality variables to speciﬁc performance dimensions by helping to iden- tify theoretically relevant predictors for different criteria. In this model, the construct of motivation was expanded to highlight how different personality variables inﬂuence different components. Self-regulation is the primary component that previous models were missing. This construct is very important because it is strongly related to personality; helps explain how people with similar knowl- edge, ability, goals, and desire to perform differ in their level of performance; and helps explain how people overcome their habits to perform in accordance with their goals. Further research relat- ing speciﬁc personality variables to speciﬁc motivation components will be valuable in expanding this model and furthering our un- derstanding of the personality-performance link.
