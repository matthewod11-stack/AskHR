# Personality and Mood

To understand how personality traits can affect the occurrence of CWBs through mood states, it is important to review the manner in which these traits are linked to mood states generally. We dis- cuss this from the standpoint of the Three-Factor Model of per- sonality introduced by Tellegen (1985).

Tellegen (1985) identiﬁes three orthogonal personality dimen- sions: Extraversion/Positive Emotionality (E/PE), Neuroticism/ Negative Emotionality (N/NE), and Disinhibition/Constraint (DvC). For the purposes of this section, the N/NE and E/PE fac- tors are the most relevant factors. N/NE refers to the extent to which an individual perceives the world as threatening, problem- atic, and distressing, and E/PE concerns an individual’s willingness to engage the environment (Clark & Watson, 1999). Abundant ev- idence links these two factors to the Big Five factors. Essentially, E/PE and N/NE dimensions represent the Extraversion and Neu- roticism dimensions from the Big Five (McCrae & Costa, 1985; Watson, Clark, & Harkness, 1994).

An important feature of Tellegen’s conception (1985) of E/PE and N/NE—and one that distinguishes it from the Big Five con- ception of Extraversion and Neuroticism—is that different affective states are at the core of the E/PE and N/NE dimensions. For instance, despite transitory shifts in mood, those high in N/NE gen- erally experience the world as distressing and frequently experi- ence feelings of guilt, sadness, anger, and contempt. In contrast,
