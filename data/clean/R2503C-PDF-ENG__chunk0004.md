## HBR / Magazine Article / Lean Strategy Making

In contrast, strategic decision-making is the epitome of nonstandard

work at most companies. Strategic decisions are often thought to be

unique—like snowﬂakes—with each one requiring a bespoke process.

Consequently, similar decisions—for instance, about whether to enter new markets—are frequently handled in vastly diﬀerent ways within

the same company. That inconsistency leads to slower, lower-quality

decisions—a problem that’s starkly clear in the feedback Bain &

Company received from the executives at 350 large companies we

surveyed about their strategy processes. We discovered that:

- Though nearly 50% of the survey respondents reported that their

companies used standard templates for developing strategic plans,

very few ﬁrms followed a consistent approach to making critical

decisions. In most cases the process was left to the discretion of the

executive in charge or varied with the type of decision.

- One quarter of the strategic decisions made by companies proved to

be suboptimal in hindsight, according to the executives. Leadership

frequently chose a course of action that was either incorrect or inferior

to other options. Many of those decisions were costly or impossible to

reverse, forcing companies to live with the consequences for years.

- Decision-making at the respondents’ companies was also too slow

more than 45% of the time. As a result, even when the right choice was eventually made, performance often suﬀered because market and

competitive conditions had shifted during the delay.

- On average, the respondents’ companies achieved less than 70% of

the results their strategies aimed for. That shortfall was often blamed

on poor execution, with the assumption that the strategy itself was
