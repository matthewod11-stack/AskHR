Performance reviews are typically not the highlight of anyone’s to-do

list. Throw in a ﬂaky, shaky economy and a couple of rough quarters,

and they’re even less appealing. You want your employees to come away

motivated and enthusiastic about their work. But when business is slow,

they also need a clear understanding of how they contribute to the

company’s bottom line.
