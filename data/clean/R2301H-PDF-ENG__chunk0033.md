rudderless and passive and need help organizing and focusing their efforts

- When people quiet down when you enter the room

- When people donâ€™t offer counteropinions

- When you want to energize people without triggering fear

- When change is happening rapidly and chaotically

- When people need more support and time to think

- When your emotions have been triggered

- When the world has turned upside down and you need to stabilize the situation
