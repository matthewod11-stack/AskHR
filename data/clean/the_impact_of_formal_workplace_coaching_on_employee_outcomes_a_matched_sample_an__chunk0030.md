# Measurement model

To ensure a consistent factor structure and acceptable model fit across our two groups, we followed Pousa et al. (2018), estimating a separate confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for each. Factor structures were identical, with standardised factor loadings of similar magnitude, statistically significant, and exceeding the accepted threshold ( >.05) (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988). Model fit was evaluated using commonly accepted thresholds: comparative fit index (CFI) ≥.95, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤.08, and the standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) ≤.10 (Williams et al., 2009). Independent CFA results were acceptable. Coached group fit indices were χ2(df) = 196.47(125), CFI = .97, RMSEA = .05, and SRMR = .05. No-coach group fit indices were χ2(df) = 206.61(125), CFI = .97, RMSEA = .06, and SRMR = .07.

Measurement invariance testing

MI confirms that different groups interpret latent variable scales equivalently (Throuvala et al., 2021) and is a necessary precondition for group comparison. We conducted measurement invariance testing (MI) to ensure that the work-related outcome compar- isons between our two groups were valid. MI testing examines group equivalence in
