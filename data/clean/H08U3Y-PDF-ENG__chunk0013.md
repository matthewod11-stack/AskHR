## bureaucracies, often sclerotic and opaque.

Information is increasingly abundant and isn’t equally distributed.

Every decision (in this case, about speciﬁc developments or zoning

laws) involves vast amounts of information across domains—from resident preferences and technical documents to traﬃc and usage

metrics. Furthermore, processes are often expressed in long, detailed,

technical documents that the average person cannot be expected to

understand. Those with more resources have the time, money, and

expertise to get the information they need to form an educated opinion

while other community members do not.
