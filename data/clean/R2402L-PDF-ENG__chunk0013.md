## high-stakes negotiations. More recently, as an adviser to executives and

corporations, I’ve learned that the same rules can be applied to yield

better outcomes in everyday business negotiations—whether you’re

asking for a higher salary, lobbying for additional team resources, or

hammering out the details of a contract with a client or a supplier.

No matter the situation, negotiators must remember one golden rule:

It’s not about you. The only way to move someone else in your direction

and ﬁnd a solution on which you can agree is to listen deeply and

empathetically, ensuring that the other person feels seen, heard, and

understood. That is particularly powerful when the two sides are in

disagreement. It allows you to build trust, manage expectations, and

ﬁnd ways to meet the other party’s key needs. It’s what I call level-ﬁve listening, and it is fundamental to eﬀective negotiation.

As Ernest Hemingway once said, “When people talk, listen completely.

Most people never listen.” Negotiators who do set themselves apart.

But it takes discipline of mind and body to accomplish, particularly

when emotions are running high. The right mindset and a tool kit of

techniques can help.
