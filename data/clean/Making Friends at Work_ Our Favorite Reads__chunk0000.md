There are a lot of things I miss about the office, but mostly, it’s my

friends: Early morning (existential) what-is-this-world talks withShalmalee and Trisha, walks through the office courtyard withUrvashi and Digvijay in the afternoons, and making plans withAnshika to co-parent a desk plant, that sadly, never came tofruition.Four of them quit during the pandemic, sending me into acomplete mental spiral. “We’re still friends,” they said, “You knowthat, right?” So cool. So calm. So reassured.
