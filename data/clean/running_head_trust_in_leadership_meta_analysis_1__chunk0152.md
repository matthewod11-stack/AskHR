# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

leader-follower trust should look to facilitate this base of trust in particular. Employee

affective trust is driven by a perception that the leader has good intentions towards them and

cares for their wellbeing. Therefore, training aimed at equipping managers with the skills to

develop such positive orientations in employees where affective trust can emerge would be

highly beneficial. The most practical strategy for meaningfully targeting trust in this way is to

focus on developing those leadership styles most associated with affective trust. Based on the

findings of this meta-analysis, leadership development programs targeted at ethical and

servant leadership would be particularly beneficial. Equally, organisations could look to

select leaders who demonstrate an inclination towards a given leadership style. For example,

many leadership assessment processes now include the measurement of leadership styles

through practitioner-oriented scales such as the MLQ or integrity tests. Through adopting

such suggestions, organisations will not only benefit from enhanced performance and OCB,

but many of the other salutatory benefits which may follow from trust in the workplace. It is

also important to note, however, that many leadership styles have significant direct effects on

either performance or OCB over and above the indirect effects observed via trust or LMX. If

organisations are purely interested in influencing performance or OCB, our analysis suggests

that transformational and servant leadership have the largest overall effects on these variables
