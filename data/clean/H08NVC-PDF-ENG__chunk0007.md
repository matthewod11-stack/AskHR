What’s stopping these companies’ mental health initiatives from

engaging employees and creating real change?

My consulting experience with over 60 global and regional

organizations has led me to conclude that the main pitfalls for mental

health initiatives across cultures tend to be about three things.

First, many HR oﬃcers mistakenly attribute initiative failures to local

cultural norms and stigma, assuming that individuals in some locations

are simply unwilling to discuss mental health when, in fact, there’s

another underlying issue at play. Second, when stigma does come into

play, they wrongfully assume that silence and disengagement mean that

attitudes of particular groups of employees are unchangeable.
