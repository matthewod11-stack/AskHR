# INTRODUCTION

‘‘They say the seeds of what we will do are in all of us, but it always seemed to me that in those who make jokes in life the seeds are covered with better soil and with a higher grade of manure.’’ (Ernest Hemingway)

This paper is about humor, though it is not intended to be humorous. However, ‘‘no one complains when a scientiﬁc analysis of sex fails to arouse its readers’’ (Davis, 1993, p. 4), so we make no apologies. Rather, we argue that humor is a universal human phenomenon that is underexplored as a valuable tool for understanding human behavior. Our sincerest wish is that by the time the reader ﬁnishes this paper, he or she will never laugh at humor again. But seriously folks y . We hope to convince you that although humor might appear to be inconsistent with the serious nature of work, it inserts itself in some form in most social contexts (Berger, 1987), and plays an important role in regulating social behavior in all societies (Caron, 2002). As for such, we believe that humor can have signiﬁcant organizations and the management of their human resources.
