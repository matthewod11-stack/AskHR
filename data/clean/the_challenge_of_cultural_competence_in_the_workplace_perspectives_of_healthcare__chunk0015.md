Materials Participants completed a 19-item questionnaire ascer- taining their general perspectives on culturally compe- tent care, their experiences working with multi-cultural patients, their own levels of cultural competence and the extent their organizations addressed cultural competence in the workplace. The questions were both multiple choice (n = 15) and open-ended (n = 4). For the multiple choice questions, participants were asked the extent to which they agree or disagree with various general statements (e.g., Do you think health service providers should consider a patientâ€™s cultural background when treating them?), to reflect on how often their own skills align with best practice cross-cultural care (e.g., Do you feel that you attend to the cultural needs of patients from difference cultural backgrounds?) and the importance they afford to various skillsets (Do you think it is important to learn about dif- ferent cultures as part of your practice?). Open ended questions prompted participants to elaborate on their perceptions and experiences (e.g., What areas of cultural awareness/competence do you feel that you and/or your organisation perform well?). The combination of both closed and open-ended questions allowed for a baseline understanding of participant views across key ideas, which could then elucidated through nuanced personal narratives.

to which they believe

The questionnaire was developed by the study authors through their own expertise and after reviewing the rele- vant public health and cross-cultural health care literature. Questions were selected based on their relevance to the study (e.g., health care environments) and their alignment with the expectations and principles of cross-cultural communication philosophies (e.g., cultural competence, cultural awareness, cultural safety). No previous validated questionnaire specifically tailored to the cross-cultural ex- periences of health care professionals was located for use.

Procedure Researchers contacted participating health care net- works in mid-2016 to ascertain their interest in being involved in the study. After receiving support from their respective internal review boards, the organiza- tions distributed an online link to the study survey to clinical and professional staff via email. The link was accompanied with a short passage enquiring if staff were interested in participating in an anonymous online research study survey on cross-cultural health care ser- vice delivery experiences.

Individuals who opted to click on the study link were presented with a digital consent form outlining the re- quirements and their involvement in the study. After con- senting, participants then completed the anonymous online health care provider cross-cultural experiences
