# Management Support

When beginning the implementation phase of a performance appraisal program, often the president or another administrator makes appropriate comments at a convoca- tion or issues a letter pledging his/her support. All this is tine if preceded by intimate involvement in the developmental phase and followed by a demonstrated personal commitment. If performance appraisal is to be taken seriously, managers and supervi- sors at all levels of the institution must be conscientiously involved. In fact, how well they accomplish this task should be reflected in their performance ratings.
