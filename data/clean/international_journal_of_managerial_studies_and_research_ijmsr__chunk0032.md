# The Need for Power:

This is the dislike to have impact, to be influenced and to control others. They also have the desire to coach, teach or encourage others to achieve, they love to work and are concerned with discipline and self respect. The need for power has both negative and positive respect. The negative side is manifested in a winner’s take all mentality e.g. “if I win you u lose” The positive side is focused on accomplishing group goals and helping others obtain the feeling of competence.

Other theories exist and include equality theory which states that it is not the actual reward that motivate but the perception, and the perception is based not on the reward in isolation, but in comparison with the efforts that went into getting it and the rewards efforts of others. The reinforcement theory of the B.F Skinner indicates the effects of the consequences of a particulars bahaviour on the future occurrences of the behaviour which are positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment and extraction.
