semester hours, while doctoral programs typically require 100 or more. Both degrees require the equivalent of at least one schoolyearofsupervisedinternship(aminimumof1,200hours at the nondoctoral level and 1,500 hours at the doctoral level). School psychologists are granted practice credentials (cer- tiﬁcates or licenses) by each state’s department of education (SDE) and/or by a separate state board of examiners in psy- chology (SBEP). The SDE credentials school psychologists for practice in the settings under its jurisdiction, typically all public schools but also possibly private schools, correctional schools, and residential schools. The SBEP credentials prac- titioners, often referred to as health service providers, for practice in settings under its jurisdiction, typically all non- school settings within the state (e.g., mental health centers, hospitals, independent private practice). In some states the jurisdictional authority is less distinct.
