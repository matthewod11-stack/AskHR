# these goals.

The prospect of publicly disclosing a lack of progress towards diversity

goals is likely unnerving for many. But maybe leaders’ intuitions about

the costs of transparency in this context are misplaced. Contemporary

leaders likely underestimate how meaningful it is to their employees,

customers, and a broader web of stakeholders to show that they have

the conviction to own their diversity struggles — and to hold themselves

accountable to making good on their commitments.
