## Identifying Personality Characteristics and Psychopathology

procedures with respect to how personality is viewed. From a traditional assessment perspective, these authors pointed out, personality consists of characteristics that lead people to be- have in certain ways, and understanding a person’s actions is a product of examining his or her underlying tendencies or dispositions. From a behavioral perspective, by contrast, personality “is deﬁned according to the likelihood of an individual manifesting certain behavioral tendencies in the variety of situations that comprise his day-to-day living” (Goldfried&Kent,1972,p.412).Behaviorallyspeaking,then, personality is not an a priori set of concrete action tendencies that people have and carry around with them, but is rather a convenient abstraction for summarizing after the fact how people have been observed to interact with their environment. These innovative conceptions of personality, echoed in nu- merous other books and articles, led during the 1970s and 1980s to a dramatic growth of interest in developing assess- ment methods in which the obtained data would consist of representative samples of behavior that could be objectively evaluated for their implications after the fact, as contrasted with test responses to be interpreted inferentially as signs of underlying states or traits they are presumed before the fact to measure. The core techniques used to achieve this purpose of behavioral assessment included (a) observational ratings of person’s responses in natural and contrived situations, as suggested by the OSS methods and by situations devised by Paul (1966) to assess the effectiveness of systematic desensi- tization;(b)observedconductinrole-playingexercises,based on procedures developed by Rotter and Wickens (1948); (c) self-report instruments focused on speciﬁc behavioral interactions, as had earlier been exempliﬁed by measures like Geer’s(1965)FearSurveySchedule;(d)psychophysiological measurements, which were suggested by the successful em- ployment of such techniques in the then emerging ﬁeld of behavioral medicine research (see Kallman & Feuerstein, 1977); and (e) behavioral interviews speciﬁcally focused on how people respond to certain kinds of situations in their lives.

The late 1980s saw gradual moderation of the original conceptual underpinnings of behavioral assessment and con- siderable broadening of its focus. It is currently widely rec- ognized that people are not as “trait-less” as Mischel argued, nor are traditional and behavioral methods of assessment as distinct and mutually exclusive as Goldfried and Kent origi- nally suggested. In the case of Mischel’s argument, behav- ioral assessors rediscovered Lewin’s classic maxim that how people behave is an interactive function of their dispositional nature and the environmental circumstances in which they ﬁnd themselves, and the advent of cognitive perspectives in behavioral approaches encouraged behavioral assessors to
