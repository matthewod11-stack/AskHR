## Self-Regulation and Self-Directed Learning

Self-regulated learning is the amalgamation of affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes during learning, in an effort to reach a desired goal (Sitzmann & Ely 2011). Regulatory mecha- nisms used during self-regulated learning include planning, monitoring, metacognition, attention, persistence, and time management. Alignment of learner goals with learning objectives, learner perceptions that goals are attainable, and maintenance of learner motivation are important for both self-regulation of goals and self-directed learning. Self-regulation failure in the form of either goal abandonment or goal switching may result if goals are misaligned or deemed unattainable or if learner motivation is low (Schunk & Zimmerman 2012). Goal abandonment has been in- vestigated as a cause of attrition from voluntary online training. Sitzmann (2012) found that the self-regulatory process fully mediated the relationship between conscientiousness and attrition from training. Conscientiousness moderated the effects of commitment and self-efficacy on at- trition. That is, a high level of conscientiousness seemed to serve as a buffer against learners dropping out of training, especially for those who were less committed or less confident. Inter- ventions in which learners are reminded of self-regulation appear to help them effectively manage their time during training and to counteract attrition, a common disadvantage of volitional online learning (Sitzmann et al. 2009, Sitzmann & Ely 2010).

Self-directed learning may occur formally or informally, online, or in the context of social learning. Self-directed learning has been discussed in the literature for decades, but research on its
