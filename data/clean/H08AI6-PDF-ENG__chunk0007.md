# but for the beneﬁt of their family.

Family is one of the most important things in most people’s lives, across

cultures and geographies. Yet, the idea that family can be motivational

at work has been overlooked. Instead, in the past, family has been

mostly seen as competing with work for an employee’s ﬁnite resources,

like their time and energy. A large body of research on work-family

conﬂict drew on this notion and illustrated how work and family

domains create conﬂicting demands and interfere with one another.
