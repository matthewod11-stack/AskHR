## between our youngest employees and our most-senior ones.

Is there any risk of abuse?

You do need to monitor for that. Each year a small number of employees—

about 1 in 10,000—become compulsive users, and for their sake as well as

the firm’s, we need to intervene.

Do you have any “cheat codes” for organizations that want to try

gamified training?

Collect data on people’s play so that you can improve the user experience.

Don’t make the training only about the firm; think about the why, not just

the what. We’ve modified Globerunner to include content about purpose—

things that relate not just to our service offerings but also to the value

they bring to clients, along with elements to help our people discover their

personal purpose. And don’t be afraid to expand. We have another gamified

training that educates employees about specific clients and prospects. We

often include it in proposals to prospects to demonstrate our commitment

should they sign with us. Twenty years ago it would have been hard to

imagine that a game-like experience could help us win business—but here

we are.
