# Basic Provisions/Requirements

The regulations implementing VEVRAA include the obligation to refrain from discrimination in employment

against protected veterans. The regulations also require all covered contracts and subcontracts to include the

clause at 41 CFR 60-300.5 in each of their nonexempt contracts and subcontracts.

In addition, VEVRAA requires contractors and subcontractors to list most employment openings with an

appropriate employment service delivery system. Exempted from this mandatory job listing requirement are

executive and top management positions, positions that will be ﬁlled from within the contractor's organization,

and positions lasting three days or less. Listing employment openings with the State workforce agency job

bank or local employment service delivery system where the opening occurs will satisfy the requirement to list jobs with the local employment service delivery system.

Covered contractors and subcontractors are also required to make reasonable accommodations for the

known physical or mental limitations of qualiﬁed disabled veterans, unless providing an accommodation

would create an undue hardship. In addition, covered contractors and subcontractors are required to take all

necessary actions to ensure no one attempts to intimidate or discriminate against any individual for ﬁling a complaint or participating in a proceeding under VEVRAA.

Written Program. Under the regulations implementing VEVRAA, certain contractors and subcontractors are

required to have a written program for employing and advancing in employment protected veterans.

Speciﬁcally, each contractor or subcontractor that has (1) 50 or more employees, and (2) a Federal contract or

subcontract of $150,000 or more must prepare, implement, and maintain a written program for each of its establishments.

A contractor establishment required under VEVRAA to develop and maintain a written program must preserve

its supporting documentation for the immediately preceding year, unless the contractor establishment was not

then covered by the requirement.
