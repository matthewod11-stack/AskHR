## 6.7 PREVENTING RATING DISTORTION THROUGH RATER TRAINING PROGRAMS

Rater training programs have the overall objective of providing raters with tools that will allow them to implement the performance management system effectively and efficiently. These training programs also help prevent rating distortion. Table 6.3 summarizes the reasons discussed earlier for why raters are likely to inflate or deflate ratings.

Recall that, in addition to intentional errors, raters are likely to make unintentional errors in rating performance. Training programs, therefore, must address both types of errors and essentially, the goal is to align the goals of the rater with the goals of the performance management system so that raters are partners and active contributors to the process.45 Specifically, training programs may cover the following topics:
