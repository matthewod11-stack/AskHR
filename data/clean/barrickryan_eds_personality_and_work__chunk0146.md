Wright, 2000) between labor and management: an organization could increase productivity simply by increasing the happiness and satisfaction of its employees, and both organizations and employees would beneﬁt. But the empiri- cal evidence for the association between happiness and productivity has been as elusive as the relation itself is desirable. A series of qual- itative and quantitative reviews (Brayﬁeld & Crockett, 1955; Iaffal- dano & Muchinsky, 1985; Vroom, 1964) showed that the association between happiness and productivity is trivial. These reviews have led some researchers to relegate the “notion of the happy-productive worker to the folklore of management—as an unsubstantiated claim of practitioners and the popular press” (Wright & Staw, 1999, p. 1). In recent years, however, there has been a resurgence of in- terest in the happy worker; researchers have conducted more care- ful analyses of existing studies, developed new paradigms for testing the relation, and modiﬁed the original job satisfaction– productivity hypothesis.
