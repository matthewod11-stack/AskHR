# Neuropsychological Test Batteries

The inception of broadly based and multifaceted test batteries for assessing neuropsychological functioning can be credited to the efforts of Ward Halstead (1908–1969), who in 1935 established a laboratory at the University of Chicago for the purpose of studying the effects of brain damage. Halstead’s observations convinced him that brain damage produces a wide range of cognitive, perceptual, and sensorimotor deﬁcits that cannot be identiﬁed by any single psychological test. He accordingly devised numerous tasks for measuring various aspects of cerebral functioning. In subsequent collab- oration with one of his graduate students, Ralph Reitan, he gradually reduced the number of these tasks to seven for which empirically determined cutoff scores showed good promise for distinguishing normal from impaired brain func- tioning. This set of tasks became formalized as the Halstead- Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery (HRB) in the 1950s and continues to have a major place in neuropsychological assessment (see Reitan & Wolfson, 1993). Developed origi- nally with adults, the HRB was later extended down- ward for children age 9 to 15 (Halstead Neuropsychological Test Battery for Children and Allied Procedures) and age 5 to 9 (Reitan-Indiana Neuropsychological Test Battery for Children).

Theprimarilyquantitativeapproachtoneuropsychological assessment represented by the HRB stimulated considerable research and attracted to assessment practice a substantial contingent of brain-behavior scientists who might not other- wise have become directly involved in clinical work. Also exerting a lasting inﬂuence on assessment methods was a qualitative approach to identifying neuropsychological im- pairment, which stemmed from the work of Alexander Luria (1902–1977) in the Soviet Union. Luria believed that more could be learned from behavioral features of how people deal with test materials than from the scores they earn, and he accordingly emphasized measures designed to maximize opportunities for respondents to demonstrate various kinds of behavior he considered relevant in diagnosing brain dysfunction.

In Luria’s approach, conclusions are based less on psycho- metricdatathanonanexaminer’sobservationsandinferences. Although Luria’s testing methods and his theoretical formula- tion of functional systems in the brain date from the 1930s, it was not until his work was ﬁrst translated into English in the
