Because of my urgent need to accomplish change, I followed the unconventional route of establishing an ofﬁce of strategy manage- ment at the outset of our Balanced Score- card project. I also wanted the OSM to re- port directly to me—that was a way to highlight the importance of this ofﬁce to my strategic agenda. But the OSM needed other clearly deﬁned linkages or relationships, too; I want change at CBS to come from within, not to be imposed from above. To that end, I created a dotted-line reporting relationship between the OSM and two other key execu- tives at CBS, the CFO and the COO, who ulti- mately are going to help execute the change agenda. I did not create the new corporate- level OSM unit lightly. Its positioning in the organization enables me to fulﬁll my inter- nal duties as a change leader but doesn’t af- fect my ability to meet the many external obligations I have as the CEO of a rapidly evolving public-sector organization emerg- ing from crisis—Canada’s blood-supply sys- tem was completely revamped after thou- sands of people received contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.

As for the OSM’s responsibilities, I see strategy management as being made up of strategy formula- three high-level processes: tion, leading in turn to which then cycles back to strategy formulation. The exhibit “The Processes of Strategy” shows the activi- ties within the categories. The OSM has pri-
