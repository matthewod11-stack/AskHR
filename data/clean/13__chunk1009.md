## The Happy/Productive Worker Thesis Revisited

Robert Hoppock. In this landmark study, Hoppock reported job satisfac- tion levels for a sample of APA vocational and industrial psychologists. According to Hoppock (1937, p. 300), as regards to their level of job satisfaction, psychologists appeared ‘‘neither better or worse than the average man of comparable position in other ﬁelds of work.’’ The second article, by Donald E. Super, examined the relationship between employee occupational level and job satisfaction (Super, 1939). It would be almost another 10 years, or more precisely, 1948, before job satisfaction focused articles appeared again in JAP (Wright, 2006). As two examples, Kerr (1948) reported on the validity and reliability of the Job Satisfaction Tear Ballot and Nahm (1949) undertook a study on nursing satisfaction. As we will discuss next, this relative neglect of job satisfaction early on drastically changed with the increased awareness of a possible job satisfaction with job performance association.
