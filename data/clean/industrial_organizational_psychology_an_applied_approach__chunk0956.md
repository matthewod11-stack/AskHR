# Situation-Wanted Ads

Situation-wanted ads are placed by the applicant rather than by organizations. As shown in Figure ., these ads take a variety of forms: Some list extensive qualifications, some give applicants’ names, and some are generally more cre- ative than others. Two studies (Williams & Garris, ; Willis, Miller, & Huff, ) investigated the effectiveness of these ads by contacting applicants for white-collar jobs who had placed situation-wanted ads in a variety of daily and professional publications. The results of the two studies are encouraging: .% of those applicants placing ads were contacted. However, not all contacts were from employers. Instead, some were from employment agencies, résumé-writing services, and even an encyclopedia salesperson (how could the applicant afford an encyclopedia when she didn’t even have a job?). Of the applicants who placed the ads, .% did receive actual job offers. Situation-wanted ads appear to be a useful way of looking for a job, and given that they don’t cost an organization any money, they may be a beneficial method of recruitment.
