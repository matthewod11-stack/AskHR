## The Evolution of the Laboratory Experiment

In the experiments with which psychology began, such as Weber’s study of tactual sensitivity, Fechner’s research in psychophysics, or Ebbinghaus’s study of memory, a single individual served as both experimenter and observer. In sub- sequent research in psychophysics and memory, the roles of experimenter and observer became separated in order to eliminate, or control for, possible biases that might stem from knowledge of the experiment and the expectations that might inﬂuence an observation, such as knowing the intensity of stimulus to be judged quantitatively (Dehue, 1997, 2000). Separating the role of experimenter from that of observer, interpolating “catch-trials” (in which no stimulus was pre- sented), and randomizing the presentation of stimuli became common practices in psychophysical research and were adapted to other psychological experiments (Dehue, 1997). Moreover, as psychological research expanded to include

experiments that assessed the responses of children and ani- mals, requiring little or no introspection, authority became increasingly centered in the experimenter and participants became “subjects” rather than “observers.”
