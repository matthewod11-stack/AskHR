## HBR / Digital Article / 10 Signs of a Toxic Boss — and How to Protect Yourself

- 8. They belittle and demoralize.

Toxic bosses will “joke” at the expense of others and talk negatively

behind people’s backs. They will rarely have good things to say about

people and will look to generate agreement from others that their

opinion is true.

- 9. They seek to blame others.

When issues arise or mistakes are made, toxic bosses will look to

blame everyone but themselves. They will go to great lengths to explain

how others are culpable for the outcomes arising from errors, while

exonerating themselves.

- 10. They’re overconﬁdent about their knowledge.

Toxic bosses routinely overestimate their skills and knowledge, leading

them to believe that they are better at their job than they actually

are. They continually think that they have the knowledge required and

reject any suggestions of self-development.

It only takes one of these traits to generate toxicity in the workplace and

their impact can be felt across teams and the organization.
