## Theoretical Foundations of Reputation Development and Transmission

Social Comparison Theory Social comparison theory was developed by Festinger (1954) to address how people evaluate their opinions and abilities when no objective standards are available, by comparing themselves with other people. Subsequently, Festinger’s theory has been applied beyond ‘‘opinions and abilities’’ to include a number of personal attributes (e.g., Wood, 1989), which makes it relevant for the conceptualization of reputation in organizations. A considerable amount of research over the past several decades, since the articulation of social comparison theory, has dealt with the different types of referent comparisons people choose, the conditions under which each type is selected, and the effects of different choices on individuals’ attitudes and behavior (e.g., Kulik & Ambrose, 1992; Wood, 2000).

initially suggested that individuals would compare themselves with people who were similar. However, in the subsequent half century, research has identiﬁed a number of different comparison bases or referents, including self-present, self-past, self-future, other (past, present, and future), and system (e.g., Goodman, 1974; Kulik & Ambrose, 1992). Furthermore, research has demonstrated that individuals do not necessarily compare themselves only with others who are similar, as Festinger originally argued. Instead, individuals have been found to also engage in downward comparisons (Wills, 1981), and upward comparisons (Collins, 1996).
