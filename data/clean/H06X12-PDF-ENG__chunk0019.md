# career breaks.”

By our count, nearly 40% of the Fortune 50 have an in-house career

reentry program. As employer career reentry programs continue to

expand in number, and as the existing programs scale and run longer,

there will be more relaunchers inside organizations — people who may

be more likely to favor hiring someone else who took a career break.

For years, LinkedIn has helped relaunchers rebuild their networks by

making it easy to ﬁnd and connect with long-lost colleagues from the

past. And with 800 million members, LinkedIn plays a powerful role

as the arbiter of career path proﬁling. LinkedIn’s decision to make “Career Break” an oﬃcial category in the LinkedIn proﬁle Experience

section validates the career break as a standard part of career paths for

those who elect to take one — and recognizes the value of the career

break experience itself. This marks a major leap forward in the gradual

progress we’ve been seeing in the nearly 20 years since the concept of

reentry programs ﬁrst took hold.
