# Use traditional employees

With these factors in mind, we believe that remote work is hastening a

shift that reduces hiring, screening, and monitoring costs for managers

and lessens burdens on workers to understand ﬁrm-speciﬁc context.

A few important changes have brought us here. First, we’ve seen

a mindset shift around remote work. Hiring managers for remote

positions are now more comfortable interfacing with people they have

not met personally, opening the door to work from anywhere — and

to open/ﬂexible hiring. Second, companies have invested in virtual

communications tools (e.g., video calls and screen sharing) that make

it easier to troubleshoot problems remotely and give outside workers

a way to interface and get/give feedback. Third, remote work and

tools like Slack have forced companies to better deﬁne tasks, codifying

processes and speciﬁcations, making it easier to write speciﬁcations that

a worker with little ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge can understand, which can

enable opening up a company.
