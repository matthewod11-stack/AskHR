# Subjects and procedure

Respondents were employees from two firms in the United States. One organization is a business technology company (Company A) with approxi- mately 150 employees, and the second (Company B) an accounting firm with 45 employees. Both companies are members of the BDO Alliance Diversity Roundtable (BDO). The BDO is a nationwide association of approximately 20 independently owned local and regional accounting, con- sulting, and technology service-related firms with similar client service goals, i.e., expand services to their clients (https://alliance.bdo.com/). The BDO has affiliative ties to the American Institute for Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA), a nonprofit organization that created and distributes an annual AICPA Diversity and Inclusion toolkit for its members’ use through the BDO. The third coauthor’s company is a BDO member and secured permission to solicit companies to partake in this study. Of the ten or so firms participating in the Roundtable at the time, Companies A and B were the only respondents that agreed to have their employees surveyed.
