title: The Feedback Fallacy
---
## from our people—and from ourselves—is not, for the most part, tidy

adherence to a procedure agreed upon in advance or, for that matter,

the ability to expose one another’s ﬂaws. It’s that people contribute their

own unique and growing talents to a common good, when that good is

ever-evolving, when we are, for all the right reasons, making it up as we

go along. Feedback has nothing to oﬀer to that.

We humans do not do well when someone whose intentions are unclear

tells us where we stand, how good we “really” are, and what we must do

to ﬁx ourselves. We excel only when people who know us and care about

us tell us what they experience and what they feel, and in particular

when they see something within us that really works.
