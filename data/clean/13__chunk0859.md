# Individualism versus Collectivism

Individualism–collectivism is the most frequently discussed dimension of societal culture isolated by cross-cultural researchers (e.g., Triandis, 1995). In their empirical examination of cultural values measures developed in different parts of the world, Smith, Dugan, and Trompenaars (1996) determined that individualism and collectivism are basic dimensions of human values across societies. At the individualism– collectivism distinction is the notion of the group. For collectivists, the groups to which one belongs are a substantial source of identity, and important distinctions are made between members of one’s ingroup and outgroup members. Because ingroups are so important to collectivists, the goals of the group take precedence over individual goals, and group norms tend to be more closely followed in collectivist than individualist societies. In contrast, in individualistic societies, people are loosely connected to groups, and tend to view relationships in terms of exchanges. Because individualism–collectivism is relevant to issues of relationships between people, and humor has been implicated as an important determinant of interpersonal cohesiveness, this cultural dimension might be particularly important for the examination of humor
