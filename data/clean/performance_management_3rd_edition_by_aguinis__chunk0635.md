# 4.4 APPROACHES TO MEASURING PERFORMANCE

Before we discuss how to measure performance, we must remember that employees do not perform in a vacuum. Figure 4.1 shows that employees work in an organizational context, engaging in certain behaviors that produce certain results. The same employee may behave differently (and produce different results) if placed in a different situation (e.g., working with a different supervisor or using better or worse equipment).

Given the model shown in Figure 4.1, there are three approaches that can be used

to measure performance: the behavior, results, and trait approaches.18
