# and appropriate work.

This is important: women returning from parental leave persistently report diﬃculties getting enough work, or enough good work.

Colleagues’ reluctance to give them work may be benevolent (“With the

baby, I knew it wasn’t a good time for her”) or hostile (“I need someone

whose ﬁrst priority is work, not home.”) This is gender stereotyping, and

represents a legal risk if left unchecked.

- 3. Design a gradual return-to-work.

While some mothers get too little work when they return from

leave, others get too much. Setting a still-nursing mother against an

insurmountable wall of work is a sure path to attrition. Best practice

is a gradual return-to-work policy: for example, providing all returning

leave-takers with a 50% schedule that gradually builds back to full time

(deﬁned by their target schedule.) Absent a formal policy, companies

typically ﬁnd that some departments have little trouble with returning

leave-takers while others with less supportive supervisors face high

attrition. The gradual return-to-work policy means that inﬂexible

supervisors do less damage.
