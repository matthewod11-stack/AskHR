Therefore, what the employer does not know can hurt them, should a case go to trial

based on the contents of the handbook. Because of this growing trend ( employment

related lawsuits), many companies no longer utilize handbooks. Case law has illustrated

excellent examples where courts have ruled that the contents within a handbook are

binding. The companies that continue to use handbooks have found that disclaimers have

been effective in reducing lawsuits.

Evidence clearly shows the at-will employee doctrine is in decline and cases are

constantly being lost, causing a new perspective in addressing employment issues.

Employers are now utilizing arbitration as a means of reaching a solution to complex work

related issues. However, some companies have mandatory arbitration. Courts are in favor

of a mandatory arbitration process, while other courts (appellate) have struck down such

programs. Most employees' employment status is at-will, and they have gone on to fight

the discharge. Yet, there are steps being explored that a.11 employer can take to reduce the

possibility oflawsuits and or loss in court. Many wrongful discharge preventive measures

range from inexpensive to costly, based on an organization's budget. Nevertheless, all

areas, from the advertisement to the employees last day, play a vital role in determining if

an employer error occurred.
