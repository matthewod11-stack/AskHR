that unit — a job/career strategy, a family strategy, a mental health/

mindfulness strategy, and so on — just as each business unit does with

the overarching corporate strategy.

For example, to develop a job/career strategy, ask yourself the following

questions: How does my current job support my purpose and vision?

Does my current job give me a sense of achievement and engagement

(two of the six great-life dimensions)? How does my current job align

with the strengths I identiﬁed in the purpose step? Finally, look for

benchmarking data, such as BCG’s Decoding Global Ways of Working

study, where we list the top 10 criteria of great jobs according to more

than 200,000 respondents. Again, rate how your job measures up to

these criteria. The answers to these questions will give you an idea of

how to move forward in your career.
