# What Drives These Effects?

Monitoring is a stressful workplace experience for employees, triggering

a range of reactionary responses, depending on how the stressor

is interpreted. Hindrances — often referred to as “bad stress” —

unnecessarily constrain employees and prompt them to withdraw from

their work. By contrast, challenges — often referred to as “good stress”

— promote personal growth and motivate employees to solve problems.

Our studies found that remote employees perceived observational

monitoring as a hindrance, leading them to actively withhold ideas

and suggestions. In contrast, interactional monitoring was viewed as

a challenge, motivating employees to participate and share ideas to

improve their work unit.

We also found that employees’ trust in their supervisors played a crucial

role. Remote employees under observational monitoring reported low

levels of trust their supervisors, which led them to keep their thoughts

to themselves. Conversely, employees experiencing interactional

monitoring reported high levels of trust in their supervisors and felt

more willing to be vulnerable and share new ideas.
