Data: Quantitative questionnaire data from Gender Equality Barometer 2008. N = 610/606 employees.

This paper focuses only on employees’ perceptions and examines how both individual and employment factors relate to their perceptions of gender inequality. This study makes a distinction between employees’ perceptions of gender inequality in society in general and in their own workplaces in particular. The study draws on the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999), anticipatory injustice model (Shapiro and Kirkman’s, 2001), relative deprivation theory (Crosby, 1982), as well as role-balance theory (Marks and MacDermid, 1996).

The empirical analysis supports earlier studies claiming that there is a belief among employees of widespread gender inequality in society in general, but not in their own workplaces. The study thus illustrates that while employees realize that there are problems in Finland concerning gender inequality as a whole, they tend not to perceive the existence of this very problem in their own lives.

The study suggests that employees’ perceptions of societal and workplace gender inequality are related to different individual and employment factors and some of those factors even have a contradictory effect on their perceptions. The finding that lower-level white-collar employees and ordinary workers perceive workplace gender inequality to a greater extent than employees in supervisory or management positions as well as upper-level white-collar employees is worth mentioning. In my opinion, the fact that gender inequality is perceived by employees in high hierarchical positions as existing somewhere else but, not in their workplace, leads to its continuous acceptance and reproduction at each level.
