eﬀectiveness. This alignment involves tailoring feedback to match

employees’ personal goals and values, thereby enhancing its relevance

and ensuring it is perceived as supportive and constructive rather than

punitive. It’s crucial to frame negative feedback as an opportunity for

growth and development to foster a forward-looking and constructive

dialogue that encourages continuous improvement and learning. Our

research shows that negative feedback may feel even more negative
