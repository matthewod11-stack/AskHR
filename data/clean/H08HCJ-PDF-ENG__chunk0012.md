# The Firms That Pose the Biggest Threats

Intuitively, large ﬁrms with very similar business models to startups

may appear to be the most dangerous, as they rely on the same

specialists and may be more attractive to talented local workers because

of larger salaries or beneﬁt oﬀerings. To investigate the impact of

similarity on startup growth, we used the business descriptions of large

ﬁrms and startups to create similarity scores — a high score meant that

a ﬁrm and startup had more similar businesses, and a low score meant

they were relatively dissimilar.

We found that the higher the similarity, the weaker the crowding eﬀects

for startups — though they were still present. When startups are similar

to surrounding large ﬁrms, their growth (in terms of the number of job

ads they posted relative to other startups) only diminished by 20%,

whereas dissimilar startups saw decreases by up to 60%. This seems to

suggest that similarity can oﬀset some of the negative growth impacts

that startups may experience when they have to oﬀer higher salaries.

This data thus provides evidence that large ﬁrms do not create “kill

zones” in the labor market for startups interested in pursuing similar

aims, even as they still seem to have a negative impact on a startups’
