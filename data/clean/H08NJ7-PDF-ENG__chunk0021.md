# Asking/listening (high pull + low push)

At the top left is the Asking/listening style, which aligns closely with

the most traditional deﬁnition of coaching. This style involves listening

actively and asking compelling, open-ended questions to guide the

coachee’s thinking. For example, you could ask, “What do you think is

the best way to approach this challenge?” or “You mentioned the client

feedback on this project is not great. What in your mind seems to be the

core of the problem?” This helps the coachee self-reﬂect, think deeply,

and own their decision-making instead of being told what to do.

The Asking/listening style requires a lot of preparation; you need to be

up to speed on what is happening with your coachee in order to ask the

right questions. As a result, it can be tempting to shy away from it and resort to the Telling style instead. But while it may feel diﬃcult to hold

back from simply giving advice or sharing a solution at ﬁrst, this style

does get easier with practice.
