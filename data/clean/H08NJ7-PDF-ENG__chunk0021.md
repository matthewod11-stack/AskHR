## HBR / Digital Article / 4 Styles of Coaching—and When to Use Them

Use the hands-oﬀ style when your team members are experienced and

competent at carrying out their tasks or a project at hand. Sometimes,

this can mean an employee with a lot of experience, or an employee who

has mastered the task. It requires you to put some checks and balances

in place—like regular catch-ups to ensure everything is on track—while

being comfortable letting people work with little or no supervision.

For example, say a senior product manager comes to you and says, “Our

new project requires us to do a couple focus group discussions. I did

these for the product launch for [brand]. I think we’re okay.” As a hands-

oﬀ coach, you could say, “Great. I trust you to deliver this. Maybe you

could share a broad plan with me, and keep me posted on milestones? If

you need any support on, say, internal budgets or approvals, I’m happy

to intervene.”
