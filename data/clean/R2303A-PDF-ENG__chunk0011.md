When Beau was born with Down syndrome, in 2004, we felt a mix

of emotions: fear of the unknown, because neither of us had had any

experience with disability; worry about what our newborn son would

need and how we could help him navigate the world; and, candidly,

grief over the loss of the child we’d expected to have. Thankfully, we

both quickly transitioned to a more positive mindset—embracing Beau

as he is and feeling very blessed to have him.

Five years later, when Bitty, too, was born with Down syndrome, we

weren’t afraid, worried, or sad. Not only had our fourth child made

it into this world—despite doctors’ having given her a 25% chance of

survival—but she had the same disability as Beau.
