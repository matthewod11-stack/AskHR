the research design is based on cross-sectional self-reported data. Spector (2019) has argued that cross- sectional research designs can still provide evidence for variable relation- ships, and that inflated results due to self-report common method variance is often overstated, particularly when relevant control variables (such as gender, age, race, political scale, religion, organization tenure, position lev- el/role used here) rule out spurious relationships (Spector, 2021). A one- factor test showed that 30% of the variance was captured by the first factor, which is not inconsistent with prior studies (Spector, 2019). Both outcomes, productivity and intent to stay, were one-item, which did not allow for computing a reliability estimate. However, prior OB research has also used one item measures of outcomes, such as intent to stay (e.g., Davila & Garcia, 2012; Huynh et al., 2012). Recently, Matthews, Pineault and Hong (2022) have defended the use of such one-item measures. However, multi- item self-report measures of productivity and intent to stay, allowing for reliability estimates, are needed to confirm these initial results. Collecting other source data, such as supervisor-rated productivity and employee turn- over records, would be ideal.

Due to survey response anonymity,

The research design allowed for controlling a greater number of demo- graphic and organizational level variables before testing for the impact of OB scales on outcomes, compared to previous research (e.g., Knapp et al., 2014; Stamper & Masterson, 2002; Van Dyne & Pierce, 2004). However, small sub-samples within several variables necessitated aggregating specific categories together into a more general category for t-tests and regression analyses, i.e., under race, the nonwhite race category (combined all other racial categories), under religion, non-Christian (combined all other reli- gions), and under position level/role, two broadly-aggregated categories, i.e., management versus non-management. Combining smaller sub-samples into a larger category has been done, e.g., race (Stamper & Masterson, 2002). Future research, using larger, more diverse samples, would not necessitate such aggregating. Despite these limitations, a promising 16-item scales: Be Myself, OB Measure was developed, Acceptance, Diversity Valued and Connection.
