# CONCLUSIONS

Best practices guidelines, and the scorecards designed to as- sess a company’s execution of them, show great promise for support- ing EHM program developers and health promotion practitioners intent on continuous improvement of employee engagement in, and positive outcomes resulting from, the best practices components of- fered. This study offers several considerations that should facilitate the use of the current scorecards and that can inform future develop- ment work on best practices components. First, one size does not ﬁt allcompanieswhenitcomestohowselectbestpracticescomponents can inﬂuence employee engagement and successful health improve- ment. This study showed how ﬁnancial incentives, environmental supports, biometric screenings, and wellness champion networks all perform differently, both positively and negatively inﬂuencing en- gagement and outcomes, according to the demographic proﬁle of a company. Future research is needed to strengthen our understanding of the interaction between a population’s demographics and the role that different EHM program components have in addressing demo- graphic factors. More speciﬁcally, to what extent are enrollment and behaviorchangemitigatedbyrelativelyintransigentvariablessuchas the age, sex, and the health status of the population? Conversely, can best practices components be conﬁgured in a way that exerts enough inﬂuence, independently of mitigating factors, to improve engage- ment rates and health outcomes? Should best practices be “cherry picked” and selected on the basis of a company’s demographic and health status proﬁle?

Second, best practices may work best when they create inertia for select groups. That is, these ﬁndings suggest that there is a herd effectrelatedtoprogramengagementsuchthatwhenaprogramcom- ponent such as a biometric screening or a certain type of incentive is offered, the inﬂuence can have an enhanced impact within demo- graphically similar subgroups. Finally, although there is much to be enthused about concerning how best practices components operate and how this knowledge can be applied to EHM programs, there are many questions that need answers before we can conﬁdently
