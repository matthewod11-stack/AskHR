## Analyzing Best Practices in Employee Health Management

not be interpreted to necessarily mean that environmental supports do not increase the likelihood of participation in countless other wellness intervention opportunities, although that may be the case. The negative relationship could also mean that employees were less drawn to health coaching because the worksite was offering so many other supports for fostering health improvement. Without a more extensive battery of measures of both environmental supports and intervention options, we are unable to fully understand the nature of many interactions between best practices components, engagement, and outcomes.

Finally, our ability to extrapolate the meaning behind the rela- tionships between best practices and program outcomes is substan- tially limited by the current deﬁnitions for each best practice compo- nent and by how the deﬁnitions were interpreted by respondents who completed the HERO Scorecards. Many items in the HERO Score- card used for this study were simply three-point Likert-type scales that may lack the speciﬁcity needed to truly distinguish best prac- tice from what has become standard practice in EHM. Also, many such items were essentially a judgment call by those who completed the HERO Scorecard. For example, “strong leadership support” may have been deemed by one respondent to require active participation in programs whereas another respondent might have considered en- dorsement and communications from key executives as indicative of leadership support. As of this writing, no research had yet examined the interrater reliability of the HERO Scorecard, and hence rater variability might be quite dramatic. Findings from research, similar to this study, will help inform the reﬁnements needed to improve our understanding of what constitutes best practices that appreciably improve engagement and outcomes.

One of our initial motivations for conducting the present re- searchwastouseourﬁndingstodevelopabestpractices“calculator.” Surely a large data set such as we used for this research would pro- vide ample empirical support for a tool with inputs derived from best practices components and outputs that would have predictive value concerning engagement and outcomes. Instead, this study demon- stratesthatthepredictivevalueofscorecardsmaybehighlymitigated by factors that are not yet fully understood or represented in contem- porary guidelines. It follows that best practice component deﬁnitions on the HERO Scorecard may need further reﬁnement. Additional factors that predict success need to be introduced and guidelines need to be accompanied by demographic covariates that mitigate, and are mitigated by, each of the best practices components. This study enumerates empirically derived examples of how best prac- tices components need to be considered separately, perhaps more so than together, to improve their predictive value and strengthen their contribution to the advancement of EHM.
