Both WHD and ETA may debar an employer or any successor in interest to that employer from receiving future labor certiﬁcations for up to three years if the employer substantially violated a material term or condition of its temporary labor certiﬁcation.

Foreign workers employed under the H-2A program are not covered under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act

(MSPA); however, various other laws, such as workers' compensation, tax (unemployment insurance, local, state, and Federal), the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act may apply to the employment of these workers.

Copies of the application forms, regulations, and relevant directives may be obtained from the Employment and Training Administration's national oﬃce. Copies of Wage and Hour Division publications may be obtained from the Wage and Hour Division Web site or by contacting
