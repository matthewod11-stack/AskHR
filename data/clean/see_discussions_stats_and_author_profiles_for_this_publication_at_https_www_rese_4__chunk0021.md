to enhance sen(cid:415)ments associated with inspira(cid:415)on, percep(cid:415)ons of customer loyalty and overall

advocacy by employees. It should be noted however that the ENPS scores of an organiza(cid:415)on could

hold their organiza(cid:415)ons to higher standards than customers.(cid:51)(cid:32)
