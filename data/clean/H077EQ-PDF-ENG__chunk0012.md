# ﬁrst place.

There are ways out of anchoring. The ﬁrst step is gaining clarity around

the data. When we are clearer about the evidence, we are less likely to

get hoodwinked. When it comes to a big decision, for instance, I often

write down all the factors involved. Writing down the information helps

me evaluate its reliability and eliminate anchors that aren’t relevant.
