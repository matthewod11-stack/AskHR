## to leadership development programs, such as mentorship programs

or leadership coaching. According to research, employees that have

access to these kinds of professional development opportunities have

34% higher retention than those who do not. What’s more, a nationally

representative study found that companies with mentoring programs

saw an 18% increase in Black women managers over ﬁve years.

But leadership development is only eﬀective if it’s implemented

equitably. This is where we see many organizations falling short,

starting with the selection process.

In a study of 200 people leaders, which included a survey and

qualitative interviews, we found that while 79% said identifying high-

potential leaders (often for development programs) was a high priority,

only 16% have a formal process in place to do so. A staggering 85%

of leaders told us they relied on informal manager feedback to make

decisions about who should get a leadership development opportunity.

Most HR professionals sense that this is a problem: 51% admitted that

the way they currently select leaders gave some employees an unfair

advantage. They are onto something. According to McKinsey’s 2021

Women in the Workplace study, white men make up 35% of entry-level

employees but 62% of the C-suite. The reverse pattern is true for women
