# The Way of Ideas: Rejecting Realism

Beginning with Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), scientists dis- tinguished between primary and secondary sense properties (the terms are John Locke’s). Primary sense properties are those that actually belong to the physical world-machine;

they are objective. Secondary properties are those added to experience by our sensory apparatus; they are subjective. Galileo wrote in his book The Assayer:

Whenever I conceive any material or corporeal substance I immediately . . . think of it as bounded, and as having this or that shape; as being large or small [and] as being in motion or at rest. . . . From these conditions I cannot separate such a substance by any stretch of my imagination. But that it must be white or red, bitter or sweet, noisy or silent, and of sweet or foul odor, my mind does not feel compelled to bring in as necessary ac- companiments. . . . Hence, I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on . . . reside only in the consciousness [so that] if the living creature were removed all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilated.

The key word in this passage is consciousness. For ancient philosophers, there was only one world, the real physical world with which we are in direct touch, though the Platon- ists added the transcendental world of the Forms, but it, too, was external to us. But the concept of secondary sense prop- erties created a New World, the inner world of consciousness, populated by mental objects—ideas—possessing sensory properties not found in objects themselves. In this new repre- sentational view of cognition—the Way of Ideas—we per- ceive objects not directly but indirectly via representations— ideas—found in consciousness. Some secondary properties correspond to physical features objects actually possess. For example, color corresponds to different wavelengths of light to which retinal receptors respond. That color is not a primary property, however, is demonstrated by the existence of color- blind individuals, whose color perception is limited or ab- sent. Objects are not colored, only ideas are colored. Other secondary properties, such as being beautiful or good, are even more troublesome, because they seem to correspond to no physical facts but appear to reside only in consciousness. Our modern opinion that beauty and goodness are subjective judgments informed by cultural norms is one consequence of the transformation of experience wrought by the Scientiﬁc Revolution.
