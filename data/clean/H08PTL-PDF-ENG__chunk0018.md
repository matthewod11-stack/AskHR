## members toward alignment and decision-making.

Summarizing may sound like something AI could handle easily, but it’s

a powerful way for the chair to shape how the board understands things

and the conclusions they reach. It’s about listening carefully, ﬁnding the

main threads of the conversation, then putting it all together in a way

that builds consensus and moves things forward. If there’s confusion or

discord among the board members, the chair must step in and provide

the context they need. Summarizing diﬀerent viewpoints enables chairs

to subtly guide the narrative.

While AI can summarize a conversation, it can miss nuances, such as

the things people aren’t saying or shifts in mood, that a good chair

can pick up on and use in their summary. It’s about reading the room,

adding context and reframing, and making decisions.
