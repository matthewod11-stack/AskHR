## Of course, not every organization bets on potential. Startups, for

example, may favor candidates with job-ready expertise, since they

need people who can contribute immediately. In other cases, ﬁrms

in low-trust or high-turnover environments tend to deprioritize

foundational skills because they don’t expect long-term retention.

Still, for companies thinking beyond the next quarter, foundational

skills matter. They shape a person’s growth path—and their long-term

ceiling. But there are reasons beyond individuals’ performance for ﬁrms

to consider fundamental skills.
