# during cost-cutting measures.

Managers who are invaluable to an organization ﬁnd a balance between

strategic leadership and hands-on involvement without micromanaging

their teams. They’re perceived as more adaptable and capable of

responding quickly to changes, making them more resilient in volatile

business situations. Managers who have deep understanding of team

dynamics, challenges, and goals and who can demonstrate their ability

to speak to the details will make seem like they’re the glue holding the

team together, which makes it harder to see their role as dispensable.

- 3. Lack of visibility

Being the quiet worker bee won’t protect you from being laid oﬀ. In fact,

being invisible could be your downfall. When determining which roles

to cut, if senior leadership doesn’t know who you are, what you do, or

the impact you make, your job could be an easy choice for elimination.
