## Actions to Take Before Pushing Your CRO Out the Door

Turning over the CRO may feel like the only action when revenue

targets are under threat. Our work with CEOs and commercial

organizations across industries and company sizes, however, often ﬁnds

that a missed target can be as much about the operating environment as

it is an issue with leadership.

CEOs are quick to lament their CRO isn’t “a data-driven leader”

or lacks analytical chops. More commonly, CROs are saddled with

incredibly poor data which is insuﬃcient to identify root causes of

underperformance. If your underlying commercial data is in disarray

(as it is for most companies), consider a short-term engagement with

external consultants to quickly cleanse, augment, and enrich the fact base to pinpoint root cause issues in GTM eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness.

This is a no-regrets move for most leaders, and will also beneﬁt a new

leader should you proceed in that direction.
