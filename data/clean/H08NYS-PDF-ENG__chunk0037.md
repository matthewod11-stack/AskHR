## For platforms on which a dichotomized rating scale isn’t feasible or

appropriate, one of our follow-up experiments suggests that providing

customers with explicit instructions can reduce biased ratings.

Speciﬁcally, within a ﬁve-star scale, evaluators who were explicitly

guided to focus on distinguishing “good” from “bad” performance gave

higher ratings to workers of color compared to those evaluators who

retain their existing rating systems can improve fairness by clearly

deﬁning what each rating means and actively encouraging customers

Eﬀective evaluation processes must be accurate, fair, and easy to

understand. Our research demonstrates that a simple shift from
