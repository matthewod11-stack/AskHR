## Analyzing Best Practices in Employee Health Management

practices research in EHM. Still, recent studies offer preliminary evidence that one size does not ﬁt all in developing EHM programs. For example, even though the use of ﬁnancial incentives to increase employee engagement in EHM has become a rapidly growing best practice,26 one study of best practices components found that in- centives have a relatively modest impact if not offered alongside effective communications and within the context of a strong organi- zational culture.27 Seaverson and colleagues27 examined data from 36 employers, representing 560,000 employees and used multivari- ate regression statistics to assess the contribution of incentive value and type in relation to communications strategies and a supportive workplace environment. Using completion of an HA as a depen- dent variable, researchers found that participation rates increased signiﬁcantly when all factors were included in the predictive model. Another similar cross-sectional study of 124 employers with 883,000 employees arrived at a strikingly similar conclusion. Using a multivariate model, Taitel and colleagues28 showed that organi- zations with low communications or cultural supports would need ﬁnancial incentive levels triple that of organizations with high com- munications and culture supports to achieve comparable HA partic- ipation levels.
