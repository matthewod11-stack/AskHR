# 7.6 ONGOING MONITORING AND EVALUATION

When the testing period is over and the performance management system has been implemented organization-wide, it is important to use clear measurements to monitor and evaluate the system.28 In a nutshell, a decision needs to be made about how to evalu- ate the systemâ€™s effectiveness, how to evaluate the extent to which the system is being implemented as planned, and how to evaluate the extent to which it is producing the intended results. The U.S. federal government takes the evaluation of performance management systems very seriously. Since the early 1990s, several laws have been passed that mandate federal agencies to develop a strategic plan, a performance plan, and a performance report.29 Although these initiatives concern agencies and not individuals, ultimately the performance of any agency depends on the performance of the individuals working in that agency. The net result of such laws as the Government Performance and Results Act is an increase in accountability and funding allocation based on performance. Thus, federal agencies are required to evaluate the relative efficiency of their various management techniques including performance management systems.
