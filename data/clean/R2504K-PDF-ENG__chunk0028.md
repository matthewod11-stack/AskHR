## HBR / Magazine Article / How to Identify the Perfect Cofounder

diverge/converge exercise. In the diverge step, each of you writes job

descriptions for the roles independently. Then share all the descriptions

(converge) and discuss where you were each coming from. Not only will

this help you better deﬁne the roles, but it will illuminate the unique

perspectives and expectations of each cofounder and set the stage for

how the leadership of the business may play out.

As part of this exercise, discuss the roles that each of you will ﬁll. Job

titles may not feel important early on, but who holds what role will

become increasingly relevant—and possibly contentious—once your

venture starts to hire people and raise capital. In some cases, it will

be obvious who should ﬁll the various roles (the person with the MBA

becomes the CEO; the person with the technical expertise becomes the

CTO). Even so, open conversations about each partner’s goals and why a

particular title makes sense are critical. They may expose red ﬂags—for

example, if a potential cofounder is motivated by ego and wants a title

that is not commensurate with his or her experience and expertise.

Finally, try to avoid naming co-CEOs; my experience shows that having

two people in the top role often creates confusion for employees

and investors about who is the ultimate decision-maker. A co-CEO

arrangement can work well, of course: I know of teams who have

pulled it oﬀ without problems. Just don’t take that route because you’re

avoiding a hard conversation about decision rights and responsibilities.

That conversation will happen at some point, and the longer you put it

oﬀ, the harder it will be.

Choose half a dozen people to “date.” As you look for cofounders to ﬁll

the gaps in your experience and expertise, you also want to test your

chemistry. Yes, this may mean you’re dating more than one person at a

time, but ultimately you’ll be more conﬁdent about the right ﬁt. People

in your network oﬀer a good pool of candidates to start with; Tamaseb’s
