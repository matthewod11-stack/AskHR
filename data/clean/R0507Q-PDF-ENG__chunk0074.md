But that view is not necessarily correct. Even an excellent set of

balanced scorecard measures does not guarantee a winning strategy.

The balanced scorecard can only translate a company’s strategy

into speciﬁc measurable objectives. A failure to convert improved

operational performance, as measured in the scorecard, into improved

ﬁnancial performance should send executives back to their drawing

boards to rethink the company’s strategy or its implementation plans.

As companies have applied the balanced scorecard, we have begun to recognize that the scorecard represents a fundamental change in the underlying assumptions about performance measurement.

As one example, disappointing ﬁnancial measures sometimes occur

because companies don’t follow up their operational improvements

with another round of actions. Quality and cycle-time improvements

can create excess capacity. Managers should be prepared to either put

the excess capacity to work or else get rid of it. The excess capacity must

be either used by boosting revenues or eliminated by reducing expenses

if operational improvements are to be brought down to the bottom line.

As companies improve their quality and response time, they eliminate

the need to build, inspect, and rework out-of-conformance products

or to reschedule and expedite delayed orders. Eliminating these tasks
