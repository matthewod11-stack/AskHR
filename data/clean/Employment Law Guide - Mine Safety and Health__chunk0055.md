# MSHA's regulations.

MSHA's Web site contains compliance assistance information, guidance, and helpful tips for the mining community. For example, it lists upcoming seminars designed for mine operators and others to receive the

latest information about the requirements of a rule or to hear about solutions to various safety and health

problems. Also, the website provides model forms, records, and plans for the mine operator to use to comply

with MSHA requirements, thus avoiding the need for the operator to create these items independently.

Through the Web site, mine operators may Ô¨Åle various reports directly with MSHA.
