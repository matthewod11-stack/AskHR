Are high in both task and person orientations Have the leadership motive pattern (high need for power, low need for affiliation) Are intelligent Are emotionally stable (don’t possess such problematic personality traits as those of the high-likability floater, the narcissist, or the passive- aggressive person) Possess the skills and personality to be a transformational leader

If individuals have these skills and traits, their leadership performance will depend on the characteristics of the situation. Thus, as shown in Figure ., cer- tain people will be effective leaders in certain situations when particular types of people are followers. For example, in a structured situation in which the leader has both legitimate and referent power (a highly favorable situation), a low-LPC leader will perform better than a high-LPC leader. If subordinates are unwilling and unable to perform a task, a directive leadership style will work better than a supportive style. If there is a climate of despair and the leader has referent power, a magnetic leadership style will work better than an informational style. Unfortu- nately, we are not yet at the stage where we can determine the exact matches that result in the best leadership for every situation. But it is probably safe to make the following assumptions.

First, because different situations require different leadership styles and skills, individuals who have a wide variety of relevant skills will be best able to be effective leaders in a larger variety of situations. That is, a person who has only excellent planning skills will be an effective leader only in situations that require planning. But a leader who has excellent skills in planning, persuasion, people, goal setting, and motivation will be able to lead in many different types of situations.

The advice that flows from this assumption is obvious. As Table . shows, an individual interested in becoming an effective leader should obtain as many leadership skills as possible. By attending leadership conferences, taking college courses, and gaining a variety of experiences, a leader can gain most of these skills. The Career Workshop box offers such a comprehensive strategy.

Second, because individuals have different needs and personalities, leaders who are able to adapt their interpersonal styles to fit the needs of followers will be better leaders than those who stick to just one behavioral style. It is much easier for a leader to adapt his style to fit the individual needs of his followers than for  people with different needs and styles to adapt their behavior to fit their leader’s needs and style.

Finally, because a leader must use different skills in different situations and act differently with different followers, it is important that she be able to under- stand the needs of the situation, the follower, or both and then behave accord- ingly. Thus, leaders who accurately recognize situational and follower needs will be more effective than those who are unable to distinguish one situation from another.

Why is the study of leadership so important? Research demonstrates that leader performance affects organizational performance. In addition, when employees trust their leaders, the employees perform better, are more satisfied with their jobs, are more committed to the organization, are less likely to quit, and are more likely to engage in organizational citizenship behaviors (Dirks & Ferrin, ).
