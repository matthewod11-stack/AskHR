We descended into the cramped hallway at the tarmac level. It was

bustling with workers moving in and out to meet ﬂights. Tanya stopped

organization. In an occupation often rendered invisible, Tanya makes

everyone feel seen. She notices—an overlooked but foundational

leadership skill that’s increasingly needed today.
