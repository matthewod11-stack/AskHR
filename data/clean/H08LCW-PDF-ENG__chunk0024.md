Be bold in drawing clear connections between your unique skills

and the role you’re interviewing for, showcasing how your experience

enables you to deliver exceptional value beyond what other candidates

can oﬀer. Connecting your experience to the job you are pursuing

and showing progressive skills acquisition throughout your career in

a succinct story will leave the interviewer satisﬁed that you are capable

of succeeding in the new role. Highlighting your unique skill is the icing

on the cake that not only sets you apart from the competition but also

makes you a more memorable and compelling choice for the job.
