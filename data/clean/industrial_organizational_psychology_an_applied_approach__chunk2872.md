# Leadership through Persuasion

One skill that is commonly needed by leaders is the ability to persuade others. Supervisors often need to persuade upper-level managers that a new program will work; politicians need to persuade fellow politicians to vote a particular way; and public relations executives often want to persuade the public to change its perception of an organization or a product. We will only briefly discuss two important aspects of persuasion here—the communicator and the message.

Persuasion by Communication Considerable research indicates that people who have certain characteristics can communicate through persuasion more easily than people who lack these charac- teristics. Let’s look at three of them: expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness.

Expertise. Research has found that in general, a leader who either has or is per- ceived as having expertise about a topic will be more persuasive than a leader who does not (Wilson & Sherrell, ). Thus, for leaders to persuade their fol- lowers, they must be the most knowledgeable about their common interest. In many high-technology fields, technical knowledge is an essential characteristic for a leader. If, however, those who are to be persuaded also are knowledgeable about a topic, the leader’s expertise plays a smaller role.

Trustworthiness. Another leader characteristic that is important in persuasion is trustworthiness. Used-car salespeople, for example, have difficulty persuading customers to buy cars because customers do not trust them. And in many corpora- tions, management is distrusted by its employees and thus has trouble convincing union members, especially, that the organization does not have the money avail- able to grant raises. Support for the importance of trust can be found in an inter- esting study of college basketball coaches. Dirks () found a strong relationship between the level of trust players had in their coach and the success of the team.

To improve his trustworthiness, a leader can do several things. First, he can occasionally argue against what appears to be his own self-interest (Walster, Aronson, & Abrahams, ). For example, he can sometimes tell his employees not to work as hard, or he can disagree with other managers. In doing so, he will not appear to be one-sided.

In trying to persuade others, a leader can communicate not only that he is similar to them (Deshpande & Stayman, ) but also that his goals are the same as theirs (Cantor, Alfonso, & Zillman, ). For example, a manager trying to increase his department budget can explain to the vice president that his goal includes saving the company money, but to do so he needs a larger recruiting budget so that better-quality employees can be hired.

Attractiveness. Chapter  briefly observed that attractive people tend to receive higher interview scores than do unattractive people. Attractiveness has the same effect with persuasion: Attractive people are more persuasive than unattractive people (Cialdini, ). This is why television commercials generally use attrac- tive people and why attractive politicians are considered to be ideal candidates.

The Message In addition to the leader’s personal attributes, the type of message that is presented also has a role in persuasion. Research has focused on three aspects of the message: message discrepancy, one-sided versus two-sided arguments, and the use of threats.

Message Discrepancy. Suppose that you are representing a group of employees in a labor negotiation. The employees currently are paid $ per hour, but you think they deserve $ per hour. What strategy would best achieve an increase to $? Would it be to ask for $ an hour and hope that management will actually give you more than $? Or would the best strategy be honesty—that is, ask for exactly what you want—$ per hour? Or would the best strategy be to ask for $ an hour so that you appear reasonable but still have room to “give in” when manage- ment offers $. per hour?

According to persuasion research, the third choice would be best. Ask for more than you want and then back down during negotiations (Cialdini, ). Asking for too much or making an argument that is too far away from that of the other side will diminish your credibility. Asking for the amount you actually desire leaves no room for negotiation.

One-Sided Versus Two-Sided Arguments. Another question that arises concerning the persuasive message is whether giving only one side of an argument is better than giving both sides. The answer is, “It depends.” If the person being persuaded already is positive about an idea, it is usually better to argue only one side of an issue. If, however, the other person disagrees with the reasoning, it is better to argue both sides. When the other side is presented, the other person’s perspec- tive is acknowledged as legitimate and understood. But after the other side of the issue has been argued, it can be refuted, and the favored side can then be reargued. If you know that an opponent will bring up negative information about you or your position, it is better to bring it up yourself to “steal their thunder” (Williams, Bourgeois, & Croyle, ).

Threats. The threat is another method of persuasion a leader can use when appro- priate. For a threat to be effective, however, the person being persuaded must actually believe it will be carried out—that is, that the consequences of not com- plying are undesirable and inevitable.

For example, a supervisor tells an employee that he will be fired if he does not work overtime. For the threat to be effective, the employee must believe the supervisor has both the authority and the willingness to fire him. Even then, the threat will be effective only if the employee values his job.

Threats certainly can be effective in persuasion, but they also can have nega- tive consequences. Few people like being threatened, and many will resent the person who makes the threat. Some may even so react against the threat that they do the opposite of what the leader wants—a behavior called psychological reactance (Brehm, ).
