# strategic.

Instead of: Asking questions without context, providing stakeholders

the opportunity to wonder about your intentions and react defensively…

Try: Always disclosing your intentions and context. For example, “I’m

asking this to understand how I can align my actions with yours and

ensure I consider your point of view.”

Integrate learning with execution Eﬀective leaders tie new skills and knowledge directly to achieving

results. You must balance the pursuit of knowledge with the imperative

of action. By tying what you learn to speciﬁc work your team does, you

add depth to your contributions and instill a sense of conﬁdence in your

ability to deliver results.
