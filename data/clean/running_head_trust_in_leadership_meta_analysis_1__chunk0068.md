## correlate of trust rather than an antecedent.

A related issue is the conceptual and theoretical similarities between LMX and trust

and the fact that some scholars have positioned trust as a defining feature of LMX (Liden &

Graen, 1980). Indeed, the literature is often vague about the conceptual differences between

trust and LMX. While we recognise that the two concepts are conceptually related, we see

three key differences that influence how these variables might operate as SET mechanisms in

the leader follower relationship. First, LMX focuses on followers’ perceptions of the degree

to which they have a positive relationship with their leader (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). In

contrast, trust is a psychological state that represents a volitional choice to be vulnerable to

another party (van der Werff et al., 2019). Second, trust as a willingness to be vulnerable, is

based on expectations of the other party’s behaviour. However, trust theorists argue that these

expectations are informed by more than perceptions of the leader’s past behaviour and that

heuristic processes play a key role in trust formation (Baer et al., 2018; Kramer & Lewicki,

2010). In contrast, LMX is argued to be built specifically on the history of exchanges

between a leader and follower (e.g., Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). Third, as observed by Brower

et al. (2000), the foundations of LMX assume a level of reciprocity in the relationship that is

not necessarily a feature of trust relationships (Korsgaard et al., 2015).

Based on their meta-analytic review, Dirks and Ferrin (2002) advocated that trust

should be treated as a construct separate from LMX. In support, Scandura and Pellegrini

(2008) found significant discriminant validity between trust and LMX. Despite this,
