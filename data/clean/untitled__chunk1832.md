# Eugenics

The concept of eugenics was ﬁrst developed in England by a cousin of Charles Darwin’s, Francis Galton (1822–1911),

who proposed that measures be taken to prevent the spread of hereditary defect in society. Galton’s ideas included ﬁnancial allowances for children born to “superior” parents and dis- couragement or prohibition of marriage and reproduction among those of lesser quality (Galton, 1909). In one essay, Galton proposed that the value of a prospective child might be calculated in terms of its future economic contribution or cost to society, and this would determine what amount might be spent to encourage the potential parents to reproduce. In the case of severe degenerate defect, sterilization might be considered. As the presence of a degenerate taint might not be visible in a particular individual, a history of disorder in one’s ancestors would be adequate grounds for the application of eugenic measures.

Galton’s ideas found a particular promoter in Karl Pearson, a professor of eugenics at the University of London, who opened a eugenics laboratory and became the driving force in the eugenics society that Galton founded. Pearson also presented the eugenics program in a series of publica- tions (Pearson, 1909, 1910, 1911). These ideas found support in the United States, where some states legalized sterilization of mentally retarded people. Goddard’s (1912) then-famous study of the Kallikak family reinforced the argument for sterilization.
