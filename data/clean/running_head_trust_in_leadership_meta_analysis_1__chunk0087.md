# correlation (œÅ). 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) of the sample-weighted mean correlation

and the 80% credibility intervals (80% CV) of the corrected population correlation were also

calculated and reported. Furthermore, in order to better determine whether moderators were

present, we calculated the percentage of variance accounted for in the corrected population

correlation by sampling and measurement error (% VE).

In order to examine the mediating effects, relative and incremental predictive validity

issues addressed in our research questions, we used meta-analytical path analyses (see

Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995). Relative weights analysis assesses the relative contribution (i.e.,

relative importance) among several (often correlated) independent variables in a regression

analysis. Relative weights analysis converts the total variance predicted in a regression model

(i.e., R squared) into weights that indicate the proportional contribution of the various

independent variables. Specifically, these weights can be interpreted as the percentage of
