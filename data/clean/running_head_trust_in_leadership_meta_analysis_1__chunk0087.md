# key information such as scale reliabilities and correlations between variables. Measures of

trust in the leader were coded as affective, cognitive or overall trust in line with the coding

protocol set out by de Jong and colleagues (2016). Measures that captured aspects of trust

such as competence, reliability, integrity, consistency and fairness were coded as cognitive

trust. The affective trust code was applied to measures that referenced benevolence,

disclosure of information, concern for welfare or goodwill. Papers where the authors had

addressed more than one of these dimensions in the same measure, or where the

operationalisation of trust was more general, were coded as overall trust.

Our meta-analysis adopted the Hunter and Schmidt (2015) approach. This method

produces a sample weighted mean correlation (r) as well as a mean correlation corrected for

unreliability in both criterion and predictor variables, referred to as the corrected population
