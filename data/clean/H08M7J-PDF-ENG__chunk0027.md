## transition with greater conﬁdence and clarity.

Throughout this process, focus on strengthening your resilience. To

operate at your best, be intentional regarding your social, emotional,

physical, and spiritual health. For social resilience, surround yourself

with people who provide constructive support, rather than those

who perpetuate negativity. While some venting can be helpful as an

emotional release, it can also become destructive if it happens too often.
