## HBR / The Big Idea / Harnessing the Power of Age Diversity

Not all biases are blatant enough to make headlines. But even beliefs

that we hold at the subconscious level can inﬂuence our interactions

and our decision-making, often without us realizing it. For example,

imagine being asked to nominate a few teammates to lead an Instagram

campaign. Who comes to mind? Probably some of your 20-something

colleagues. Consciously, you may believe you are choosing those who

are the most qualiﬁed, most interested, and most able to beneﬁt from

the experience. Unconsciously, you may be falling back on deeply

embedded assumptions that older people dislike technology or are

uninterested in learning anything new.

When it comes to conﬂict on intergenerational teams, people often

rightly suspect there’s something age-related going on, but they

frequently assume it means something other than what it really

does. Let’s look at how this played out on one team we studied.

At the Fung Fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley,

leaders created teams of undergraduates and retirees to collaborate

on wellness products for older adults. Initially, these teams ran into

several interpersonal challenges. For example, when the retirees didn’t

respond quickly to texts sent by their younger peers, the students felt

that their counterparts weren’t taking them or the project seriously.

Meanwhile, the retirees resented their teammates’ assumptions and

seemingly haphazard communication. Work slowed as relations became

strained.

Such teams need a tool to recognize the speciﬁc age biases they may

hold, understand tensions that exist, and head oﬀ brewing conﬂict. We

recommend an assumption audit.
