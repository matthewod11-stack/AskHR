## correlation between leadership ambition and competence.

What makes ambitious people more likely to be promoted to leadership positions?

In low-information environments like job interviews, it’s hard to

gauge a person’s leadership skills. Hiring managers might misread

an attribute like ambition as a signal of competence. For example,

because ambitious individuals exhibit motivation, dedication, and determination, interviewers assume that they will be more eﬀective

and thus are more likely to select those candidates for leadership roles.

Further, ambitious individuals are more likely to opt in to opportunities

for promotion, thereby increasing the odds that they will get ahead.

Your studies relied on subjective ratings rather than objective results. Is it possible that ambitious individuals are simply less liked than people with less ambition?

ﬁnancial oﬃcer from a set of ﬁnalists) or be a subordinate group
