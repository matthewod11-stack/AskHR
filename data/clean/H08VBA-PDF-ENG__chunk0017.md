# as starting projects.

- 1. Make continuation a conscious choice.

In most companies, projects continue simply because no one challenges

them. Eﬀective organizations ﬂip this default.

At a global food company I advised, project reviews stopped being

passive reporting exercises. Sponsors were no longer allowed to

“update” leadership with progress charts; instead, they were asked a

single, pointed question: “If you had to defend this project to the board

today, would you still recommend it?”

This forced sponsors to think like investors, evaluating future value

instead of rationalizing past eﬀort. Leaders told me that this small

change triggered “the most honest conversations we’ve ever had about

our portfolio.” Within six months, 20% of projects were stopped or

signiﬁcantly re-scoped, releasing millions for digital upgrades that had

been stalled for years.
