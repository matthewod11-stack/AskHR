## HBR / Digital Article / The Insidious Effects of Hurrying

In most professional environments today, the onus is on the individual to carve out and preserve their own boundaries. This is already diﬃcult

in work cultures that prize rapid results and overwork, but as Drs.

Meyer and Rosenman point out, certain personality traits can increase

one’s susceptibility to hurry sickness. In addition to the Type A

behavior pattern, perfectionists, people pleasers, and those who equate

productivity with self-worth can be at higher risk. Perfectionists often

spend inordinate time on tasks in an attempt to achieve an unrealistic

ideal, which steals time from other necessary tasks and leaves them

quite literally hurrying to catch up. People pleasers run the risk of

saying yes to every request, leaving them overwhelmed, rushed, and in

danger of falling behind. And many achievement-oriented individuals

locate their self-worth in how much they can produce, and how quickly.
