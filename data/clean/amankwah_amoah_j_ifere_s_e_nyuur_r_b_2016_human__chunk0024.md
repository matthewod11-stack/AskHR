## The “escalation of commitment” (Brockner, 1992; Staw, 1981) and the “too much

invested to quit” perspective (Schwenk & Tang, 1989; Teger, 1980) also offer a theoretical

lens to view how and why firms persist with underperformance. This line of research argues

that “cost of strategic change”, i.e. firing underperforming workers, may simply be too high
