# moments of crisis.

Employee activism challenges our assumptions about what leaders can

and should attend to when running a business — and the extent to

which organizations can stand apart from the social, economic, and

environmental issues that are part of a noisy public sphere.

Leaders must come to terms with this shift, cede some control, and work

with stakeholders to reﬂect on the case for action — and nonaction.

The tools we’ve described help them to do this and to learn, rather than

continuing to make the same mistakes.
