included in our analysis. These rituals may have distinct positive and

negative experiences beyond those we identiﬁed. Second, while our

data spanned multiple countries (U.S., U.K., and Germany), cultural

diﬀerences in how rituals are perceived and experienced remain

an important consideration. For instance, collectivistic cultures (e.g.,

India, Indonesia) may place greater emphasis on group cohesion and

inclusivity, potentially altering the eﬀectiveness and impact of rituals

like holiday parties or team-building retreats. Employees in such

cultures may be more tolerant of the negative experiences we identiﬁed

compared to those in more individualistic cultures, such as those where

our studies took place.

Organizational rituals can be powerful tools for fostering engagement

and driving positive workplace behaviors—but only if designed

thoughtfully. Poorly planned rituals risk undermining their beneﬁts.

The checklist we’ve developed oﬀers leaders an evidence-based

framework for designing more eﬀective organizational rituals. By

systematically addressing both sides of the ritual experience—

maximizing positive elements like social connection and meaningful

recognition while minimizing negative aspects like inauthenticity and

personal sacriﬁce—organizations can transform events into meaningful

experiences that genuinely enhance engagement.
