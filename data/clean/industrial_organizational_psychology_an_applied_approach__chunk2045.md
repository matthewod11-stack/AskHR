employee motivation

that hygiene factors are necessary but not sufficient for job satisfaction and motivation. That is, if a hygiene factor is not present at an adequate level (e.g., the pay is too low), the employee will be dissatisfied and less motivated. But if all hygiene factors are represented adequately, the employee’s level of satisfaction and motivation will only be neutral. Only the presence of both motivators and hygiene factors can bring job satisfaction and motivation.

Thus, an employee who is paid a lot of money but has no control or respon- sibility over her job will probably be neither motivated nor unmotivated. But an employee who is not paid enough will be unmotivated, even though he may have tremendous control and responsibility over his job. Finally, an employee who is paid well and has control and responsibility will probably be motivated.

Again, Herzberg’s is one of those theories that makes sense but has not received strong research support. In general, researchers have criticized the the- ory because of the methods used to develop the two factors—the idea that factors such as pay can be both hygiene factors and motivators, and the fact that few independent research studies have replicated the findings obtained by Herzberg and his colleagues (Rynes, Gerhart, & Parks, ).
