## ways — and potentially undermine hard-won progress on equity-

and equality-related outcomes — it is important for managers to

anticipate such issues. My research, and complementary research by

other scholars (some of which I detail below) presents three key

suggestions for how managers can limit the chance of their policies

backﬁring. These suggestions are all rooted in taking a systems-level

view of inequality when designing and implementing DEI policies.

- 1. Consider subgroups.

When designing a DEI policy, think about variation within the group

of people the policy is aimed at helping. In my research, there was an important diﬀerence between the experiences of most women
