## appointment of a new CEO (ﬁrm cycle) with the beginning of a

yearly cycle (dominant cycle)—to see whether it had an impact on the

ﬁrm’s post-succession performance. Our sample consisted of 690 CEO

successions carried out by S&P 500 ﬁrms between 2005 and 2019.

We compared start dates of new CEOs against ﬁrms’ return on assets

(ROA) over the 12 quarters following the succession (as past research

has found that it takes three years to fully capture the eﬀects of a

new leader). We found that when CEOs began their tenures within 10

days of the calendar or their ﬁrm’s ﬁscal year (which is around 25%

of successions in our sample), their ﬁrms experienced, on average, a

0.4% higher ROA than ﬁrms whose CEOs started at any other point in

the year. This eﬀect might seem small but it equates to a nearly 31%

diﬀerence in ROA compared to our sample’s average ROA and begins

to fade after the ﬁrst 10 days. We also found that this synchronization

resulted in heightened net income for these ﬁrms, on average, over

the same post-succession period—and the eﬀects were even stronger

for CEOs who were ﬁrm outsiders, under 46 years of age, women, or
