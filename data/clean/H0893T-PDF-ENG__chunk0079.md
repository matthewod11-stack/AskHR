## Cross-training, employee resource groups, self-managed teams, and

skills training yielded mixed results in promoting managerial diversity.

These practices either increase managerial representation for some

underrepresented groups while decreasing representation for others or have minimal eﬀects on managerial diversity. Eﬀects are often mixed

across demographic groups because underrepresented groups vary in

participation in these interventions. For instance, white women are

more likely to have a college degree than Black Americans and Latinos,

which is often a prerequisite for managerial training.

While employee resource groups can create spaces for underrepresented

employees to connect, they place the burden of enacting DEI strategies on women and people of color. Other practices with mixed eﬀects

often have limited access for lower-level employees because employers

dictate which employees are eligible to participate. For example, cross-

training allows employees to broaden their skills by training in other

roles. This can be especially beneﬁcial for women and people of color, who often hold jobs that oﬀer little room for advancement and lack

access to inﬂuential social networks. Yet, many lower-level employees

are not permitted to participate in cross-training, limiting their ability

to advance their careers. Similarly, employer-provided skills training

has been declining in recent decades. This decline is problematic
