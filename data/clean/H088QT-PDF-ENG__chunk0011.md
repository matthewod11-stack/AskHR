## Likewise, during busy periods, or when teamwork and collaborative

decision-making is required, employers should have greater leeway to mandate and enforce attendance; if the reasoning is eﬀectively

communicated, employees are more likely to understand and accept

the policy. For instance, it is completely reasonable to request that

employees attend critical meetings in person. This approach seems

to be working for J.M. Smucker, which requires employees at its

headquarters to be physically present during 22 “core” weeks, which are

announced one year in advance.
