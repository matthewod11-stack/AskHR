## days rather than work-from-home ones for medical appointments or

leave, resulting in even less time with colleagues. In short, even though

employers are doing whatever they can to bring people in — free meals,

less restrictive dress codes, social events, and nicer oﬃce spaces — these eﬀorts do not appear to be working.

To overcome this challenge, we recommend shifting the focus from how

and togetherness is important. For example, when employees are new

to the organization and getting onboarded and trained, it is more

critical for them to come in and connect in person with key colleagues.
