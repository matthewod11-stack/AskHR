To safeguard against a potential layoﬀ, it’s critical to stay informed

about market trends and assess whether your chosen career is prone

to oﬀshoring or automation in the future. In some cases, U.S.-based

companies may have a U.S. manager overseeing oﬀshored talent or

automated processes. That may pose further challenges for early-career

professionals who want to grow into management positions and are

seeking experience through jobs that have been oﬀshored or automated

to get there. If you discover your job is one that’s likely to be automated

in the future or you see trends moving toward oﬀshoring your type of

position, ﬁnd ways to gain new skills that will help you transition to

another ﬁeld with less risk and will be just as (if not more) fulﬁlling. For

example, you could take on a stretch project in another department at

your company or form a side hustle consultancy.

. . .

Building a reputation for being a valuable team member through your

work and relationships is key to minimizing your risk of being laid oﬀ.

Ensure your leadership and cross-functional stakeholders know your

contributions and the impact you bring to the organization as well as

where you’ve upskilled to stay relevant, which will help position you as

an indispensable asset. This proactive approach helps ensure that your

value is recognized long before any decisions about layoﬀs are made.
