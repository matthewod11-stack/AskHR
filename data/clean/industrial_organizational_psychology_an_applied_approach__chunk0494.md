Step 4: Determine Essential KSAOs. Once the task analysis is completed and a job analyst has a list of tasks that are essential for the proper performance of a job, the next step is to identify the KSAOs needed to perform the tasks.

Currently, KSAOs are commonly referred to as competencies (Schippmann et al., ). In the old days, KSAOs were called job speciﬁ cations (job specs). Th ough there may be some disagreement among I/O psychologists, the terms KSAOs, competencies, and job specs can be used interchangeably and there is no real diﬀ erence among the three (other than which term is in vogue). When com- petencies are tied to an organization’s strategic initiatives and plans rather than to speciﬁ c tasks, the process is called competency modeling.

To refer back to our example of a police oﬃ cer accurately shooting a gun (skill), the police oﬃ cer would need to hold the gun properly and allow for such external conditions as the target distance and wind conditions (knowledge), and have the hand strength, steadiness, and vision necessary to hold the gun, pull the trigger, and aim properly (abilities). To carry the gun, the oﬃ cer would need to have a weapons certi- ﬁ cation (other characteristic). Determining important KSAOs can be done in one of two ways: logically linking tasks to KSAOs or using prepackaged questionnaires.

To logically link KSAOs to tasks, a group of SMEs brainstorm the KSAOs needed to perform each task. For example, a group of police oﬃ cers might con- sider the task of “writing accident reports” and determine that grammar skills, spelling skills, legible handwriting, and knowledge of accidents are the KSAOs needed for a police oﬃ cer to perform this task.

Once the list of essential KSAOs has been developed, another group of SMEs is given the list and asked to rate the extent to which each of the KSAOs is essential for performing the job. If a scale such as that shown in Table . is used, KSAOs with an average score of . or less are eliminated from further consideration.

As you can see in Table ., it is also important for the SMEs to determine when each KSAO is needed. Using data from the table, KSAOs that receive aver- age ratings of . or higher will be part of the employee selection process, KSAOs with average ratings between . and . will be taught at the police academy, and KSAOs with average ratings between . and . will be learned on the job during the oﬃ cer’s probationary period.

Rather than using the previously discussed process, KSAOs, or competencies, can be identiﬁ ed using such structured methods as the Job Components Inventory (JCI), Th reshold Traits Analysis (TTA), Fleishman Job Analysis Survey (F-JAS), critical incident technique (CIT), and the Personality-Related Position Require- ments Form (PPRF). Each of these will be discussed in detail later in the chapter.

Step 5: Selecting Tests to Tap KSAOs Once the important KSAOs have been identiﬁ ed, the next step is to determine the best methods to tap the KSAOs needed at the time of hire. Th ese methods will be used to select new employees and include such methods as interviews, work

job analysis and evaluation
