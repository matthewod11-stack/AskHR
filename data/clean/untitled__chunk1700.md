lives of many psychologists, there is reason to believe that both quality assessment and its practitioners are succeeding in weathering this storm.

Of greater concern than managed care is the matter of how and where the next generation of potential researchers and practitioners will be trained in assessment psychology. No matter how well-intended, the argument that assessment training belongs in internships rather than in graduate pro- grams poses a more serious threat to the future of assessment psychology than issues of how fees for service will be paid. Taking assessment out of the graduate curriculum separates it from its academic base and discourages students from be- coming involved in or enthusiastic about assessment-related research. Relegating assessment training to the internship— which means in many cases that the internship center must provide basic instruction in assessment methods before in- terns can even begin to conduct comprehensive evalua- tions—restricts the time available for students to develop even minimal competence as assessors. A further argument sometimes heard, that assessment competence is a special- ized skill to be acquired by interested students in postdoctoral programs or workshops, is even more ill-advised. Assess- ment being learned mainly as a postdoctoral specialty would divorce the ﬁeld even further from its research base and sub- tract it even further from the core content of psychology with which graduate students are made familiar.

Needed now and in the years ahead, then, to perpetuate the scientiﬁc and professional advancement of assessment psy- chology, is enlightened orchestration of graduate education. Graduate programs should be carefully crafted to acquaint students with the nature of assessment psychology and its place in psychology’s history; to provide opportunities for students to become involved in assessment research and to gain appreciation for the practical value of good assessment; and, for students in applied areas, to include pre-internship experience in conducting multimethod psychological evalua- tions and integrating the data obtained from them. Only then will assessment psychology be able in the future as in the past to contribute to expanded understanding of human behavior and the delivery of helpful psychological services.
