## Evidence for the Use of Best Practices in EHM

Although there are only a limited number of studies concern- ing how the use of best practices can improve EHM program out- comes, ﬁndings to date suggest positive relationships between some best practices and outcomes, albeit study methods make the research ﬁndings difﬁcult to generalize to other populations. One study, for example, assessed nine program components, each of which was rated high to low according to a company’s ﬁdelity to the compo- nent.Speciﬁcally,companieswerescoredaccordingtosuchqualities as leadership support for EHM, strategic planning, comprehensive communications, and the use of beneﬁts-integrated incentives. Out- comes measured were HA completion rates, intervention enrollment rates,andhealthbehaviorchangeasmeasuredbyarepeatHA.Those companies with the highest ﬁxation indices25 were shown to have signiﬁcantly better program outcomes.4 These study ﬁndings are useful for ratifying best practices components because the unit of analysis was conducted at the company level. Nevertheless, because ﬁndings were derived from a composite index, the respective inﬂu- ences of the program quality metrics were not estimated. Nor did this research assess between-company variations concerning the relative contributions of the various components to program success.
