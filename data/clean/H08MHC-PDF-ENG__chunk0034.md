# regulatory action?

When these less-than-ideal and uncommon scenarios inevitably occur, a one-size-ﬁts-all workﬂow means staﬀ must ﬁgure out how to deal with

the complexity of the work. Those complexities can be technical (what’s

the right way to do this?) or worse, organizational (what’s the right way

to do this given multiple stakeholders and their competing priorities,

existing policies, budget limitations, etc.?).

With designed simplicity, time and energy is spent on comprehensive

completeness up front. Situational ambiguity is engineered out of the

process by developing workﬂows that cover all reasonably foreseeable situations so staﬀ can easily navigate the less-common and less-

than-ideal circumstances that will inevitably arise, even if they are

encountered very soon after implementation.
