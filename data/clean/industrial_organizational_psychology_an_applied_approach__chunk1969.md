always positive, even though the training may not actually affect knowledge or future performance. For example, as shown in Table ., in a meta-analysis by Alliger, Tannenbaum, Bennett, Traver, and Shotland (), employee reactions had only a small correlation with learning and application of training.

Employee Learning Instead of using employee reactions as the criterion in evaluating training perfor- mance, actual employee learning can usually be measured. That is, if a training pro- gram is designed to increase employee knowledge of communication techniques, then creating a test to determine whether an employee actually learned is possible. This test will be administered before training and then again after the training has been completed. The measurements that will be used for the pretest and posttest, as with selection tests, must be both reliable and valid. Thus, if the purpose of a training program is to increase job knowledge, an appropriate job knowledge test must be constructed or purchased. A trainer can spend a great deal of time creating a training program and evaluating its effectiveness, but the whole training effort will be wasted if the measure used to evaluate effectiveness is no good.

The restaurant industry provides many examples of evaluating training effectiveness through employee learning. At Claim Jumpers Restaurants, servers must pass a -item menu test before they are released from training. At Rock Bottom Restaurants, learning is measured by requiring new employees to obtain written statements from their peers verifying that they have mastered their new duties; % do not perform well enough to get the required verification. To make the testing process more fun, Bugaboo Creek Restaurants hold scavenger hunts to ensure that trainees know where everything is located (Zuber, ).

At times, reliable and valid measures of training effectiveness are difficult to obtain. Perhaps a good example of this is seen with the human relations seminars that are common to training programs. Typically, an outside consultant conducts a sem- inar on a topic such as “better communication skills” or “ calming irate customers.” A seminar may run from two hours to two days in length. Once completed, however, it is important to measure the effectiveness of the seminar training.
