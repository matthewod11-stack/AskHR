# Low Self-Monitor to Low Self-Monitor

In contrast to the status enhancement motives of high self-monitors, low self-monitors are motivated primarily by the desire to build close social relationships of mutual trust (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000). This type of strong tie also builds loyalty, respect, and emo- tional commitments, which are requisite commodities for effective leadership development (Day, 2000). Strong ties also may serve as a source of resilience in crisis situations (Krackhardt & Stern, 1988). It is not that low self-monitors are completely unconcerned with impression management or public opinion. They may be acutely concerned with holding reputations as genuine and sin- cere people who act on their beliefs (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000). Nonetheless, the generally lower levels of ability to manage im- pressions effectively may result in a misperception of the behavior and motives of low self-monitors (Turnley & Bolino, 2001).

When low self-monitors build ties with others of a similar dispo- sition, there are potential risks in addition to the advantages associ- ated with enhanced trust and commitment. One disadvantage has to do with informational resources. Because of their relatively ho- mogeneous social worlds (Mehra et al., 2001), low self-monitors will have more difﬁculty obtaining fresh, nonredundant information from their networks. A second disadvantage is that low self-monitors are more constrained by their social ties because these ties are more difﬁcult to break, which may prevent access to new opportunities (Brass, 2001; Oh et al., 2002). This could pose a serious disadvan- tage in rapidly changing environments that require forming and re- forming new networks in adapting to emergent challenges.
