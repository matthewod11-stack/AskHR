## HBR / Spotlight / How to Marry Process Management and AI

used to be done manually with Post-it notes representing tasks on

whiteboards, but today AI can automate it.

We ﬁnd that descriptions of the interfaces between departments are

especially useful, particularly early on. Often these interfaces lie in

a “white space”: They’re not clearly the responsibility of any one

department and, as such, are likely sources of delays, errors, and ineﬃciency.

Process mining, which extracts process data from IT systems for

modeling, analysis, and business optimization, can be enormously

helpful during this step too. This technology, which wasn’t available

during earlier waves of process management, uses information gathered

from enterprise-system log ﬁles to see how an organization’s processes

are performing. With OTC, for instance, companies can ﬁnd out almost

in real time what computer-mediated tasks are underway and how long

it’s taking to ﬁll an order, deliver a package, and get paid by a customer.

Process mining can highlight the pain points a redesign should focus

on. Once those have been uncovered, the team can try “task mining,”

which is oﬀered by some technology vendors and typically focuses on

improving smaller processes through automation.

New technologies help scale up improved processes, and it’s much easier to deploy and get value from AI when the process it supports is well-defined and well- managed.

PepsiCo started its process-mining eﬀorts with the accounts payable

process in 2019. Since then the company has shaved thousands of hours

of human labor oﬀ that process each year and reduced write-oﬀs by
