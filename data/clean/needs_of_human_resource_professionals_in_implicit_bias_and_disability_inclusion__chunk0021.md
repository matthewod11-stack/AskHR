# Introduction

People with disabilities are one of the most marginalized groups in society, and having a disability significantly increases the likelihood of unemployment, underemployment, and poverty (Yaghmaian et al., 2019). In 2014, the United States Congress passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) mandating state vocational rehabilitation agencies to accentuate their capacity for local labor market analysis, employer engagement, customized training, and postsecondary education to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities (U.S. Department of Education, 2014). Despite this legislation, the employment rate of people with disabilities is still unacceptably low. Employment statistics indicated the employment-to-population ratio for people with disabilities was 38.3% in November 2023, which is significantly lower than the 75.3% employment rate of people without disabilities (Kessler Foundation, 2023). Employersâ€™ reluctance to hire individuals with disabilities is significantly influenced by longstanding, negative stereotypes of people with disabilities (Bezyak et al., 2021; Yaghmaian et al., 2019).

Ambivalence related to recruiting, hiring, and retaining persons with disabilities is supported by various demand-side employment studies, which highlight the impact of negative stigma on full participation of individuals with disabilities in the workforce. For example, a focus group study with employers in 13 major metropolitan areas representing a range of businesses and company sizes identified major reasons employers are not hiring people with disabilities (Grizzard, 2005). The most common response was employers needed more accurate information to dispel preconceptions about work behavior of people with disabilities. Domzal et al. (2008) completed a large-scale employer survey following the focus group study by conducting telephone surveys with a sample of senior executives representing 12 industries. Approximately 73% of the companies in their study indicated a major challenge to hiring people with disabilities is that they believe individuals with disabilities cannot effectively perform the nature of the work required.

Additional focus group investigations with employers documented as not hiring individuals with disabilities provided more detailed information (Kaye et al., 2011). They identified three themes for not hiring people with disabilities: (a) lack of awareness of disability and accommodation issues, (b) concern over costs, and (c) fear of legal liability.
