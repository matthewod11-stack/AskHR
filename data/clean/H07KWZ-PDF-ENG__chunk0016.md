## HBR / Digital Article / What HBO’s “Succession” Can Teach Us About Negotiating

seems to be well aware of the power of framing in negotiation — the fact

that the way an oﬀer is presented can inﬂuence its perceived value and,

ultimately, the negotiation’s outcome. In Nan’s case, she sends the clear

signal to the siblings that they will have to beat a solid oﬀer (Logan’s) if

they are truly interested in getting her attention.

Negotiators can increase the likelihood of their oﬀer being accepted

by framing their proposal in a way that emphasizes its beneﬁts and

minimizes its drawbacks. Roman, Kendall, and Shiv themselves could

have used framing to their advantage by highlighting the positive

aspects of their proposal while downplaying the negatives. More

generally, both buyers and sellers can powerfully impact negotiation

dynamics by framing their arguments thoughtfully.

Anchors are sticky.

When the Roy siblings tell Nan they can likely make a better oﬀer

than the bid she’s already received, she comments, “I feel like I’m in

a bidding war. Eight, nine, what’s next?” Enter the anchors that were

likely to draw future bids in their direction.

A powerful tool in negotiation, anchoring involves introducing a

speciﬁc reference point, or anchor, aimed at inﬂuencing the other

party’s perception of the value of subsequent oﬀers. Anchors are

generally used as ﬁrst oﬀers in negotiation. This means that the ﬁrst

oﬀer presented in a negotiation can have a signiﬁcant impact on the

ﬁnal outcome, even if it is not accepted. For example, a seller who

sets a high asking price for a car can anchor the buyer’s perception of

the car’s value, making subsequent negotiations more favorable to the

seller. Conversely, if the buyer sets the anchor with a lowball oﬀer, he or

she can shift the seller’s perception of the car’s value in their favor.
