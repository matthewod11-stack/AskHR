These steps represent about one-half of the GOJA process; however, they provide the foundation on which a performance appraisal system can be built.

GOJA't thoroughness in application and documentation makes it an important and useful mcthod.13

These rather disparate examples of job analysis procedures should make the point that one must very carefully design the specific job analysis to meet the purposes to which the resulting data will be applied. The APA Principle' suggested that job analy- sis procedures ". . be chosen or developed as it is appropriate to obtain job information for the purposes or application of that job analysis information."I4 Pearlman suggested an examination of the research and conceptual issues in the area before choosing an approach.is

Ghorpode indicated tnat from the more job-oriented approaches one would get information about job outputs, guidelines, controls, tasks, and other job factors.th With the more worker-oriented systems, information about aptitudes, abilities, and other human characteristics would emerge. The degree to which the appraisal system is designed to focus on these two dimensions of job analysi, will direct the nature of the procedure. Just as the job analysis procedure can be oriented toward the job or the worker, it can also be oriented toward qualitative or quantitative data. The range of data gathered in job analyses extends from truly narrative, anecdotal records to highly quantitative data that can he totally analyzed with a computer. Again, the design of the job analysis will determine the kind of data gathered.
