2020 found that

50% of hiring managers in the UK say they won’tconsider neurodivergent talent when making hiring decisions.An uncountable number of us, whether we’ve disclosed or not,have had such traumatic experiences at work that decidingwhether or not to say anything to our bosses puts us in anincredibly frightening position. As a consequence, it’s safe toassume that you may have more ND coworkers than you’re awareof. With this knowledge, you can give everyone a little more grace.

One day, it’s likely people will look back on the last few decadeswith a fair amount of shame about how ND people have beendenigrated and forced to conform to exist in an NT’s world in thesame way that in the modern day most of us feel shock that asrecently as the 1960s (and beyond, in some cultures)

left-handedkids were forced to write with their right hand or face physicalpunishment.The corporate world bears some responsibility to help the largelyNT members of their workforce bridge the communication gap.We have an opportunity, and a duty, to radically alter theworkplace and remove the barriers to full participation. It isincumbent on those of us in the know to reframe conversations onneurodiversity in the workplace so NDs are no longer excludedfrom the table. When businesses truly welcome ND workers, notonly will those workers’ lives be dramatically improved, thebusiness itself, and society as a whole, will benefit.
