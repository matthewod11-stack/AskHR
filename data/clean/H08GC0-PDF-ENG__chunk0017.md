## Laura Giurge, professor at the London School of Economics, studies

the impact of “time poverty,” which means having too many things

to do and not enough time to do them. Giurge’s research found that

employees working on weekends and holidays versus the standard

Monday to Friday, 9-to-5 hours showed decreased intrinsic motivation.

Working after hours caused people to consider better uses of their time

— leading to higher attrition.
