Another very important issue is the selection of board members. Do CEOs look

for the most able and knowledgeable people? Or do they install yes-men? The

fundamental problem in evaluating board quality is that the literature has yet to come

up with a reliable measure of high-quality boards. The analysis of governance rules

such as corporate bylaws in Gompers et al. (2003) is certainly a big step forward.

But sample limitations (there are still few panel data sets with a long enough time

series to analyze changes in corporate governance within firms) and endogenous firm

response limit the broader use and long-term reliability. The behavioral perspective

may help the quest for better measures of “who speaks up in the boardroom.”

Monetary incentives may not be all that matters. The ability to speak the language

of the CEO and/or the other board members, or even feelings of moral obligation
