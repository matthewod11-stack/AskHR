# BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS OF ORGANIZATIONS

The idea that culture is a set of principles for generating focal points in specific

microgames played by workers and managers is not so different from the way orga-

nization theories describe culture. For example, Schein (1983) defines culture as

“the basic assumptions and beliefs that are shared by members of an organization.”

He later notes that these “assumptions and beliefs are learned responses to a group’s

problems of survival in its external environment and its problems of internal inte- gration.”5 Shared understanding reduces conflict and, if the culture is visible to

outsiders, also encourages efficient assortative matching between workers’ attitudes

and the attitudes a firm requires.

As important as culture appears to be, it has not been studied very carefully

empirically. The biggest obstacle is the lack of empirical measures and exogenous

variation. One stream of literature uses psychometric scales to map organizations
