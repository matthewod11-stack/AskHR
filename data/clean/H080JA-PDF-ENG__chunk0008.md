## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Redefine Our Gendered Idea of “Ambition”

As coaches and consultants who support global companies in their

eﬀorts to grow and retain female talent, we know why this is happening.

A male-centric blueprint for ambition pervades the workplace,

imposing a path and pace that are in tension with the multiplicity

of life-stage demands — among them child-rearing, elder care, and

domestic work — that fall disproportionately to women. Those who

are unable or unwilling to submit to this blueprint are disqualiﬁed.

That was the idea that Niraj Shah, the CEO of Wayfair, conveyed to his

employees this past December in a message encouraging them to work

harder and longer. In the now infamous “Wayfair memo,” he wrote, that

employees had to ﬁgure out how to balance hard work with their other

needs. “Everyone deserves to have a great personal life — everyone

manages that in their own way — ambitious people ﬁnd way to blend

and balance the two.”

When women decelerate to establish work-life balance, they are often

perceived as lacking ambition. A switch goes to “oﬀ” in the minds

of their supervisors, who stop including them in important projects,

meetings, and conversations. But those who follow the blueprint are

typically swamped by role overload: They face structural disadvantage

and burnout, struggling to manage their many professional and

personal responsibilities. The rise of “greedy work,” where earnings rise

disproportionately if you agree to work more hours with less ﬂexibility,

has intensiﬁed the dilemma.

It’s at this point, we ﬁnd, that many women take themselves out of

the running for senior leadership positions. As Claudia Goldin’s Nobel

Prize-winning research has shown, greedy work forces heterosexual

couples with children to choose between generating wealth — which

can happen if one member of the couple works long, inﬂexible hours —

and gender equity, where both people choose ﬂexible work.
