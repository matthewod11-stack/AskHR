# 3.6 Conclusion from analysis

Based on the conducted analysis utilizing logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest

algorithms to predict employee attrition, several key conclusions can be drawn:

Random forest, particularly after tuning hyperparameters, emerged as the most effective

method for predicting employee attrition. This indicates that the ensemble approach of

combining multiple decision trees and utilizing bootstrapping and feature randomness leads to
