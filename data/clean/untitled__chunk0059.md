# Volume Preface

Numerous histories of our relatively young ﬁeld have been published. The Library of Congress lists 44 history of psy- chology titles, beginning with G. S. Brett in 1912 to Leahey in 2000, an author in this volume. More histories may have been written without the word history in the title, but that still means a history every two years. And now we add the 45th. Writing history is not easy. First, there is too much to record, and the selection process inevitably involves bias. Then there is distortion in hindsight. Any history of the ﬁeld should be called, “A Partial History . . .” or even “A Slanted History . . . ,” but those titles are understandably undesirable. So, as John Popplestone comments in his introduction, we present a partial history of selected topics.

In keeping with the diverse nature of this Handbook of Psychology, we have attempted to provide a comprehensive history—at least one that covers a broad spectrum from our wide-ranging ﬁelds of study. The ﬁrst two chapters are gen- eral overviews of psychology as a science and as a profes- sion. These are followed by several basic areas that typically are included in a core curriculum in a graduate program. We then cover a number of major professional areas and lastly three areas of special interest.

The chapter on ethnic minorities is notably different from the others in that it consists of vignettes reﬂecting on histori- cal events, some very personal, that have characterized the ﬁeld’s perception and interaction with minority groups. The chapter on international psychology includes a unique time line of events covering more than three millennia. Several of the other chapters contain events and stories that have not been recorded in other publications.

We hope that the History is both interesting and useful— and that the contributions provide an informative launching pad for this very comprehensive Handbook of Psychology.

Many people have helped in the process of completing the History. First and foremost are the chapter authors, whose contributions have made the volume possible. A number of persons have read and helped edit chapters: Douglas Detterman, James Overholser, Milton Strauss, Diane Tice, Erik Youngstrom, Gerda Freedheim, and Matt Heimback. I also would like to thank a group of editorial advisors who gave advice early on the contributors and organization of the text: David B. Baker, Florence L. Denmark, Wade E. Pickren, Milton E. Strauss, Wayne Viney, and especially Michael Wertheimer for his helpful counsel. Three staff from the Department of Psychology at Case Western Reserve Uni- versity have been invaluable with their technical help and pa- tience with a fussy editor: Felicia Bruce, Cynthia Hendrick, and Kori Kosek. Elsie Finley, librarian at CWRU, was tenacious in her pursuit of obscure references. The editors, Jennifer Simon and Isabel Pratt from John Wiley & Sons, were always helpful and encouraging, as well as the staff of Publications Development Company. And lastly, a special thanks to the general editor of the Handbook, Irving Weiner, for his patience, careful reviewing of drafts, and constant encouragement.
