# Pretest → Training → Posttest

Although this method is fairly simple, its findings are difficult to interpret because there is no control group against which the results can be compared. That is, suppose a significant difference in performance is seen between the pretest and the posttest. If a training program has occurred between the two tests, it would be tempting to credit the training for the increase. The increase, however, may have resulted from other factors, such as changes in machinery, in motivation caused by nontraining factors, or in managerial style or philosophy.

Likewise, suppose no significant increase in performance is observed between pretest and posttest. The natural conclusion might be that the training program did not work. Without a control group, that interpretation is not necessarily correct. The same changes noted above for an increase may have caused a decrease in performance in this second case. Thus, it is possible that the training

program actually did increase performance but that other factors reduced it, which resulted in no net gain in performance from training.

To overcome these problems, a control group should be used (Kearns, ). For training purposes, a control group consists of employees who will be tested and treated in the same manner as the experimental group, except that they will not receive training. The control group will be subject to the same policy, machinery, and economic conditions as the employees in the experimental group who receive training. The diagram for a pretest/posttest control group design looks like this:
