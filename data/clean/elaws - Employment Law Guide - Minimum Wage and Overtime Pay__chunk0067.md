# employers are subject to a civil money penalty for each violation that causes the death or serious injury of any

minor employee - such penalty may be doubled when the violations are determined to be willful or repeated.

When the Department of Labor assesses a civil money penalty, the employer has the right to ﬁle an exception

to the determination within 15 days of receipt of the notice. If an exception is ﬁled, it is referred to an

Administrative Law Judge for a hearing and determination as to whether the penalty is appropriate. If an

exception is not ﬁled, the penalty becomes ﬁnal.

The Department of Labor may also bring suit for back pay and an equal amount in liquidated damages, and it may obtain injunctions to restrain persons from violating the Act.

The Act also prohibits the shipment of goods in interstate commerce that were produced in violation of the

minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, or special minimum wage provisions. The Department of Labor may

seek to enjoin such shipments.
