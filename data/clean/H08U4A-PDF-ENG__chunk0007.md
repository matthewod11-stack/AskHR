 need to reinvent the wheel to measure relational

behaviors. Existing surveys can be adapted. Items not labelled

speciﬁcally as kindness can measure the conditions that help or hinder

# kindness in everyday work.

This HBR article outlines survey items used for measuring social capital

## by Press Ganey, a healthcare performance-improvement company

that specializes in measuring and improving patient, employee, and

consumer experiences. These include healthcare employees’ feelings

about being respected and involved, their sense of equity and

belonging, and perceptions of safety culture. These are items that reﬂect

environments where kindness is present. Survey items—rated on a scale

of 1 to 5, from strongly disagree to strongly agree—include the following:

- My manager treats employees with respect.

- This organization cares about patients.

- My manager encourages teamwork.

- My co-workers value employees from diﬀerent backgrounds.

- Employees can report mistakes without fear.

Customer experience data can complement employee data. In the

same survey, patient experience indicators include their perceptions of

whether they were treated in a caring and compassionate manner, and

providers’ communication practices. Key indicators include:

- Staﬀ worked well together to care for me.

- Staﬀ cared about me as a person.

- Staﬀ addressed my emotional needs.

- Nurses treated me with courtesy and respect.

- Care provider showed concern for my questions/worries. Physicians

listened carefully to me.

In Google’s Project Aristotle, internal staﬀ surveys measured staﬀ

behaviors that we see as markers for kind and respectful team cultures

such as listening without interrupting, including others in decision-

making, accepting and acting on honest feedback, and giving people

in the team equal opportunities to speak and share ideas. Measuring

these behaviors makes it clear that they’re required, not optional.

Benchmarking such data also helps teams and individuals understand

how their performance compares to others. It can help teams to

reﬂect on what they are doing well and what they can do even better.

Measuring kindness makes it visible and reframes it as a core value of

# the organization.

# Make Kindness Non-Negotiable

It’s time for organizations to stop treating kindness as an optional extra.

The evidence for kindness is clear: Kindness improves performance,

builds stronger teams, fosters trust among employees and customers,

and keeps people connected to organizations.

Like safety, quality, and professionalism, kindness must be part of

managing, taught, measured, and reinforced. It deserves to be treated

## as something vital in board reports, leadership development, and

performance conversations. It means setting a high bar for how people

work with each other and how they treat their colleagues, customers,

and other stakeholders. Kindness is the right thing to do, but it’s also

the smart thing to do to engage and retain employees and customers,

forge stronger relationships, and achieve high levels of collaboration

# and innovation.
