Performance Review Meetings at Central Florida Healthcare Federal Credit Union Central Florida Healthcare Federal Credit Union (http://www.cfhcfcu.org) is a nonprofit organization that provides financial services to those who join on a membership basis. The organization, which employs about 40 people, is based in Orlando, Florida. The credit union utilizes a Web-based system that allows tailoring each positionâ€™s performance evaluation to specific duties performed. The performance management system also involves quarterly meetings and goal setting which allow both supervisor and employee to track progress. The frequent performance reviews, including self- appraisals, were instituted in order to ensure that all employees receive regular performance feedback from supervisors who might otherwise spend more time focusing on those whose performance is considered substandard. This allows employees and supervisors to focus regularly on progress toward goals. The information systems facilitate the process by allowing both supervisor and employee to keep track of progress electronically. In summary, the Central Florida Healthcare Federal Credit Union utilizes a performance management system that includes frequent perform- ance review meetings, combined with an emphasis on setting goals and tracking progress to ensure all employees and supervisors are focused on performance management.13
