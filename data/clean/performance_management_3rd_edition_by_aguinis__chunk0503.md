## Chapter 3 • Performance Management and Strategic Planning

3.2.1.2 MISSION After the environmental analysis has been completed and the gap analysis reveals an organization’s leverage, constraints, vulnerabilities, and problems, the members of the organization must determine who they are and what they do. This information will then be incorporated into the organization’s mission statement. The mission statement summarizes the organization’s most important reason for its existence. Mission statements provide information on the purpose of the organization and its scope. Good mission statements provide answers to the following questions:

- Why does the organization exist? • What is the scope of the organization’s activities? • Who are the customers served? • What are the products or services offered?

Consider the mission statement for the Coca-Cola Company: Everything we do is inspired by our enduring mission:

- To Refresh the World ... in body, mind, and spirit. • To Inspire Moments of Optimism ... through our brands and our actions. • To Create Value and Make a Difference ... everywhere we engage.11

Presumably, this mission statement was preceded by an environmental analysis examining internal and external trends. We do not have information on this. What we do know is that this mission statement provides some information regarding the four questions noted earlier. Based on this mission statement, we have information about why the company exists (i.e., “to refresh the world”) and the scope of the organization’s activities (i.e., “to create value and make a difference”). The mission statement does not, however, include information about who are the customers served and what are the products and services offered. Also, there is no information about specific products (e.g., Sprite, Minute Maid, Powerade, Dasani).

More specific and detailed information is needed if Coca-Cola’s mission statement is to be used by its various units to create their own mission statements. More detailed information is also needed if both the organization and unit mission statements will be used as input for individual job descriptions and for managing individual and team per- formance. In general, thorough mission statements include the following components:

- Basic product or service to be offered (does what?) • Primary markets or customer groups to be served (to whom?) • Unique benefits and advantages of products or services (with what benefits?) • Technology to be used in production or delivery • Fundamental concern for survival through growth and profitability Mission statements also typically include information about the organization’s

values and beliefs, including:

- Managerial philosophy of the organization • Public image sought by the organization • Self-concept of business adopted by employees and stockholders

In sum, a mission statement defines why the organization exists, the scope of its activities, the customers served, and the products and services offered. Mission statements
