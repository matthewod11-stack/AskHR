Be consistent with your feedback sessions and build them in,rather than waiting until there is an issue to address. For example,if you’re giving a direct report an assignment — whether it’ssomething brand new or with higher stakes than their usualresponsibilities — add “pulse check” sessions into the calendarfor the end of the assignment or when the employee completescertain milestones. If an employee is supposed to win two newaccounts, you could set up pulse checks for after the first threemeetings, the negotiation, and the closure stages. Thesescheduled debriefs should include discussing what went well andwhat could have been done differently (their thoughts first, andthen your feedback). By engaging in this exercise, you’ll establisha pattern for giving and receiving feedback in real time.

As the saying goes, feedback is a gift. But too much can beoverwhelming.As a new manager, you must learn how to decide if a piece offeedback is

worth giving, or if doing so would hurt the situationmore than help it. This can be especially important (and difficult)when it comes to receiving and conveying feedback about yourdirect reports from others.Say, for example, your team is managing a conference for yourcompany. As the first day comes to a close, you overhear yoursupervisor complaining about a few elements of the event.Instead of stopping to consider if the feedback is indicative of atrend or just the opinion of one loud voice, you decide to deliver itto your team raw and without context. But in doing so, youalienate your team members and undermine your effectiveness asa new leader.
