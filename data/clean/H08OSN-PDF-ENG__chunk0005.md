We encourage leaders to work in a “ﬁt-for-purpose way.” That means

intentionally assessing what level of eﬀort makes sense for a given piece

of work. Do you discuss what is “good enough” for speciﬁc assignments

with your team members? Or what corners should be cut?

One example of a client who managed eﬀort and time well was a CEO

one of us (Jordan) coached who understood what was important and

what wasn’t. He told his board that he was going to send weekly email

updates and that these notes would be a “brain dump,” without any

editing. This allowed him to keep his board informed in real time and
