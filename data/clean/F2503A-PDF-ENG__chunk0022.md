How has gen AI changed your writing process?

My first drafts are way more polished than they used to be. I’ve never

had ghostwriters or PR people writing for me; I would say that 90% of my

communication has always come from me. The people who have edited

my work or have given feedback still do, except now they know to look

for the standard things we all must look for in writing assisted by gen AI,

such as hallucinations and stunted, robot language. They also catch stuff

that AI wouldn’t because they understand Zapier-specific context, such as

our culture, our strategy, and our customer base. Generic large language

models don’t have that context, so they’re not going to be able to give me

advice or feedback that requires that level of specificity.

Did the bot’s imitation of your writing impress you?

It was hit-or-miss. There were times when I read an answer and thought,

That’s better than what I could have come up with! I never read an answer

and thought, That’s not me! But there were times when I thought, I kind

of disagree. The longer I thought about these answers, the better I could

trace a response back to something I’d written in the past. But the bot was

lacking the context and nuance of my past answers. Others might not have

realized that it was off, but because it was imitating me, I noticed.
