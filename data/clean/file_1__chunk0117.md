Family leave: in a similar way, based on role-balance theory, employers’ perceived attitude towards family leave is expected to have an impact on whether and to what extent employees perceive workplace gender inequality. Companies that shape the needs and rights of care- givers and care-receivers by encouraging both mothers and fathers to use their family leave benefits, are competent at promoting gender equality (Knijn and Kremer, 1997). Accordingly, if employees perceive that their employers support them taking family leave, especially so that fathers can take parental leave to the same extent as mothers, employees are likely to perceive workplace gender inequality to a lesser extent than those employees whose employers’ attitude towards family leave is less encouraging.

Pay expectations: pay expectations can have an impact on the way individuals perceive the gender pay gap because individuals' perceptions of financial rewards of others are affected by the perceptions of whether their own salaries are equal to relevant salaries of others. Pay expectations, or as economists call them – reservation wage, are determined by individual wealth, labour market opportunities, opportunity costs of work performed at home, length of employment, age, skill level and other factors. Furthermore, according to social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954), pay expectations are determined by social comparison images and subsequently make comparisons among themselves, others and the idealized images. Several models have been introduced based on social comparison theory. One of them is the triadic model, which proposes that individuals with similar attributes and opinions are influential to each other (Suls, Martin and Wheeler, 2002). This may mean that those individuals who have low expectations are expected to compare themselves with those individuals who have similar expectations.
