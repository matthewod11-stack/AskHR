Among the scientiﬁc societies that proliferated across Europe and North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century were psychological societies and organizations (Appel, 1988; Gundlach, 1997). At the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst cen- tury, there are well over 1,000 psychological associations, societies, or organizations. In this chapter, we will provide a descriptive history of the development of organized psychol- ogy, beginning with international organizations, then moving to national, regional, and, ﬁnally, specialty organizations. We will not be exhaustive in our description; rather, we will at- tempt to present a representation of the various types of psy- chological societies.
