## Focus on Ethics: Ethics of Motivation Strategies

327

Once an organization has selected and trained its employees, it is important

that employees be both motivated by and satisfied with their jobs. Industrial psychologists generally define work motivation as the internal force that drives a worker to action as well as the external factors that encourage that action (Locke & Latham, ). Ability and skill determine whether a worker can do the job, but motivation determines whether the worker will do it properly. Although actually testing the relationship between motivation and performance is dif- ficult, psychologists generally agree that increased worker motivation results in increased job performance.

In this chapter, we will explore several theories that seek to explain why workers are motivated by their jobs. None of the theories completely explains motivation, but each is valuable in that it suggests ways to increase employee per- formance. Thus, even though a theory itself may not be completely supported by research, the resulting suggestions have generally led to increased performance. To get you thinking about motivation in your own life, complete Exercise . in your workbook.
