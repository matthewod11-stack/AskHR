# Trusting the System to Resolve Issues

When women complained to HR, they were often urged to be

patient and allow the issue to be quietly resolved. Senior researcher

Neev explained what happened when she complained about a senior

colleague who harassed her:

I wasn’t included in many things — there were several areas of

work that I was stronger in than all of my group members, but I

wasn’t asked to be involved. It was clearly a boys’ club. I felt that I

was treated differently to everyone else in our group, and there was

aggression too when I tried to complain about things. I couldn’t take

it anymore, so I went to HR. They told me to calm down and said that

they will look into things. They came back to me almost immediately

and said that people speak very highly about this person. But then

they were sympathetic about how I felt, they had talked to this

manager, and they were very willing to help me to better integrate

into my team. And that was it.

In their view my problem was solved, and they hinted that I

should not talk about these things to anyone because these are

very conﬁdential issues. They made me feel like an overly dramatic

person and they then offered to help me to deal with my issues. That

manager is now nice to me — but it is patronizing; it does not change

what he did. I guess they would have to talk with him. I think I

deserve some justice for what I went through. But after my experience

with HR, I am confused. I feel that I have a point which has not been

recognized, but they seem to think it has been solved. I feel really low
