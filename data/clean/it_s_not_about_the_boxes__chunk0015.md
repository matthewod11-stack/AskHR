# Keep the Junk Out of the Boxes

It’s an all-too-common mistake to load up

We have some clients who use one axis for performance and the other for behaviors. This approach makes behaviors more prominent than blending them with performance. It isn’t our preferred approach, however, since it requires an additional indicator be added to indicate potential.

While it might seem obvious that you

should try to directly map your performance management scale to the performance axis, we typically find that it’s an unhelpful exer- cise. What matters most on the performance axis is ensuring that only true high perform- ers are in the highest performance category. Too many performance management rat- ings show an unreasonably large number of people in the highest performance category. This can feed the wrong information into the rest of the potential discussion.

Your performance axis labels can take

many forms – percentiles (80th percentile and above, 50th percentile), labels (highest, aver- age, below average) or other performance indi- cators (consistently exceeds goals, consistently meets goals). Your primary concern should be that the top category truly differentiates those leaders who consistently deliver at the 75th percentile and above compared to their other

a performance and potential matrix with labels, definitions, colors and other attempts to “help” managers with the tool. This adds complexity without value and removes a man- ager’s responsibility to compellingly describe why Suzie is a high potential.

If your matrix has labels for potential, it’s your managers’ responsibility to describe why Suzie should be placed in a box. It’s not up to HR to add a lengthy definition into each box so that a manager simply points at it and says, “That’s Suzie right there!”

Similarly, what value is added by coloring the boxes or adding a label to each one? Are you going to communicate to someone that they’re a “yellow” or a “green”? In a typical 9-box, you have three definitions for potential (and hopefully some separate guidelines for potential) and three definitions for perfor- mance. That feels like enough information to provide to a manager for her to make an intel- ligent decision about someone’s placement.

Assessing High Potential without a Matrix It’s certainly possible to assess potential without using a matrix but the fundamental discussion remains the same. When we de- sign “question based” potential identification processes for clients, they start with the essen-

The blending of the what and the how keeps the rating or

classification simple but helps to ensure that weak behaviors
