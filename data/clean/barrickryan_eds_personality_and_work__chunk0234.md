## The Effect of Personal Strivings on Personality-Performance Relationships

The three motivational constructs of Accomplishment Striving, Communion Striving, and Status Striving allow us to relate indi- vidual differences in personality to performance on a variety of jobs. In this section, we relate the four relevant personality traits to the motivational constructs.

Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are personality traits that are likely to be universal predictors of performance across a variety of jobs. To apply our motivational mediator model to the case of these two traits, we assume that both affect performance through work motivation, particularly motivation related to Ac- complishment Striving. Conscientious people set goals, are more committed to those goals, and exert more effort (Barrick et al., 1993; Gellatly, 1996). Thus, they are more “motivated” at work and strive to achieve. In contrast, neurotic employees (low in Emotional Stability) have signiﬁcantly reduced motivation at work. Emotion- ally unstable people do not see themselves as worthy, are less con- ﬁdent, are frequently distracted by worrying and become obsessed with details, and are more dissatisﬁed with themselves, their jobs, and lives. Thus, they are less motivated to accomplish tasks at work, and if they are “motivated” at all, it is to avoid failure at work. Based on this reasoning, we believe these two personality traits will relate to performance through on-task effort or Accomplishment Striv- ing at work.

The effects for Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability on performance through Accomplishment Striving should exist across jobs. First, these personality traits have been found to be universal predictors of performance. Therefore, they would be expected to be valid predictors in all or nearly all jobs, which reduces (but does not eliminate) concerns about the effect of situational demands on these relationships. Second, Accomplishment Striving is a funda- mental cognitive-motivational variable that affects behavior in all jobs; it is hard to conceive of a job where an employee’s motivation to accomplish tasks will not affect performance. This may explain why Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are universal predic- tors of performance. That is, if they are related to accomplishment
