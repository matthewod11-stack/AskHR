# HBR Staff Using AI

The number of full time independent workers in the United States grew

from 13.6 million in 2020 to 27.7 million in 2024, according to research

by MBO partners. Eighty four percent are happier working on their own,

reporting better health and security. Once seen as a risky professional

path, forging your own path is something even senior corporate leaders

are now pursuing to gain control over their time, their income, and who

they want to work with.
