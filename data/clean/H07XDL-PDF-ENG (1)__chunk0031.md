There are other methods for deﬁning one’s life purpose, of course.

But it’s important to ﬁnd the time and a way to do it. We’ve seen

some workshop participants sharpen their existing purpose ideas, while

others have had a real “aha” moment, ﬁnally understanding what they

were meant to do. Purpose guides your life strategy.

- 3. What is my life vision?

The next step in building a corporate strategy is to set out a vision

for the future. We typically ask leadership teams where they want

their organization to be — in terms of innovation, growth, product

portfolio, market presence, etc. — in ﬁve to 10 years. Often we have

them ask themselves questions like, What newspaper headline about

our company would we like to read a decade from now?

Individuals should also strive to envision who they want to become in

the years ahead. As the Stoic philosopher Seneca said, “If you do not

know which port you are sailing to, no wind is favorable.” At the same

time, you want to remain open to surprises and serendipity. Seneca

commented on this as well: “Luck is what happens when preparation

meets opportunity.” Strategizing your life is the preparation.

So, ask yourself: What story would I like people to tell about me ﬁve to

10 years from now? What would I do if money wasn’t an issue? What will

the 80-year-old me not want to have missed in life? Your purpose and

your strengths might also trigger some ideas about your vision.
