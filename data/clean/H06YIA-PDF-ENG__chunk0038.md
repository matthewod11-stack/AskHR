## CEO and the near-complete renewal of the board of directors. Global

energy company ENGIE switched its primary dimension from product

to region in 2016, only to ﬂip back to product in 2021. Turbulence and

uncertainty are not conducive to a serene discussion about organization

design: They drain energy, lead to fatigue, prevent alignment, and make

people leave at all levels needlessly.

Changing an organization’s primary dimension, i.e., making a diﬀerent

choice of which verticals have full P&L responsibility, is not something

to get into lightly. But don’t do it belatedly either, when your degrees of

freedom and the time to handle it carefully are severely limited.
