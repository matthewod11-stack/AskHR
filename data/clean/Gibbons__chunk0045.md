### **[The path forward: from unconscious to conscious collaboration]{.underline}**

[The organizations and individuals who thrive in the AI era won\'t be
those with the best AI or the smartest people. They\'ll be those who
best understand how they think and can consciously direct that thinking
in partnership with AI.]{.underline}

[This requires a fundamental shift in how we engage with AI systems.
Stop asking AI what to think and start asking it to help you understand
how you think. Stop using it as an answer machine and start
collaborating with it as a thinking coach. Stop seeing it as a tool and
start engaging it as a partner in developing your metacognitive
capabilities.]{.underline}

[The Mars Climate Orbiter was lost because brilliant engineers never
stepped back to examine their own thinking. Today, we have AI partners
that can help us do exactly that --- if we\'re wise enough to engage
them as collaborators in understanding our own minds rather than just
tools for getting quick answers.]{.underline}

[The ultimate competitive advantage in the AI era isn\'t having the best
AI. It\'s having the best understanding of how your mind works in
partnership with AI. That\'s a capability no one can automate,
outsource, or commoditize. It\'s also a capability that grows stronger
with practice, creating compounding advantages over time.]{.underline}

[Start simple. Next time you open ChatGPT or Claude, don\'t ask it for
an answer. Ask it to help you understand how you\'re thinking about the
question. You might be surprised by what you discover about your own
mind.]{.underline}
