### **[Educational transformation through metacognitive AI]{.underline}**

[In education, the Mollicks at Wharton have demonstrated how AI can act
as what they call a \"force multiplier\" for instructors. Their research
shows that AI can help implement evidence-based teaching strategies that
are proven effective but often too time-consuming to execute
regularly.]{.underline}

[These strategies include uncovering student misconceptions, providing
frequent low-stakes testing, and creating distributed practice
opportunities --- all metacognitive techniques that help students
understand their own learning processes. The key is not using AI to
provide answers, but to prompt reflection.]{.underline}

[Stanford\'s Teaching Commons emphasizes this metacognitive approach,
noting that \"metacognitive skills can help students understand how
learning works, increase awareness of gaps in their learning, and lead
them to develop study techniques.\" When AI is used as a thinking
partner rather than an answer machine, it enhances these crucial
skills.]{.underline}
