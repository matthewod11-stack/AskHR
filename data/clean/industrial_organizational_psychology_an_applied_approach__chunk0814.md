Santa Cruz, California, outlaws discrimination based on height and physical appearance. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited in  cities and counties. Cincinnati, Ohio, prohibits discrimination against people of Appalachian heritage.

In addition to state and local laws, the definitions of protected classes can be expanded or narrowed by court decisions. As discussed previously, these deci- sions become case law. For example, in a variety of cases, the courts have ruled that the definition of disability should be expanded to include obesity but not former drug use, and that transsexuals are not protected as a gender.
