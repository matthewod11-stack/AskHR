# the model

Hypothesis 1, testing the inclusive leadership–OCB relation- ship, was supported (β = .433, p < .001). Similarly, hypothesis 2, testing the relationship between inclusive leadership and organiza- tional justice, was supported (β = .535; p < .001). Hypothesis 3, testing the positive effect of organizational justice on OCB, was supported (β = .217, p < .001). Hypothesis 4, examining the pos- itive influence of inclusive leadership on organizational learning culture, was also supported (β = .181, p < .05). Finally, hypothesis 5, examining the positive impact of organizational learning culture on OCB, was supported (β = .157, p < .01).

Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the study constructs. Of the four constructs, inclusive leadership has the highest mean (4.799), while organizational learning culture receives the lowest mean value (3.574). Significant correlations have been found among most of the constructs.

Hypothesis testing

To test the hypotheses proposed, the study used a structural equa- tion modeling (SEM) approach. This was developed by Anderson and Gerbing (1988) and has been popularly applied in psychology is and marketing. The path diagram of the structural model demonstrated in Figure 1. All the indices, including χ²/df = 1.441,

To test the mediating effects, the study used bootstrapping tests with a bootstrap sample of 5,000 through Amos 21.0. The study followed the procedure outlined by Preacher and Hayes (2008) with two separate mediation analyses. Results from Table 2 show that organizational justice significantly mediated the relationship between inclusive leadership and organizational citizenship behav- ior (β = .123, p < .001, 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals [95% CI] ranged from .041 to .156). Organizational learning cul- ture also mediated the relationship between inclusive leadership and organizational citizenship behavior (β = .033, p < .05, 95% CI [.001, .091]). Based on discussions by Zhao, Lynch, and Chen (2010) on the types of mediation, the study concluded that both organizational justice and organizational learning culture partially positively mediated the relationship between inclusive
