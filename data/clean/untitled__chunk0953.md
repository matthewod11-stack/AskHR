Emotion: A jungle, not a garden. One dictionary deﬁnition of a jungle describes it as a confused mass of objects, whereas a garden is a rich, well-cultivated region. The his- tory of emotion is confused and disordered, and cultivation has been at best haphazard. I will attempt to tell the story of how the jungle grew, hoping to do some cultivating and weeding in the process. When we emerge from the jungle, the reader may have some notion how to proceed with fur- ther cultivation.

The attempt to understand human emotions has been split by two apparently contradictory tendencies. On the one hand, emotion as a topic has been traditionally part of any psychol- ogy of mind—it was not possible to try to explain people without explaining emotion. On the other hand, there has been from the beginning a lack of agreement as to what ex- actly is meant by “emotion,” nor is there any discernible centripetal movement toward a consensual deﬁnition in con- temporary thought. The result is that even if one believes in the notion of human progress, there is little evidence of a focus or consensus in the psychology of emotion. Themes are often repeated and old battles resurrected, but emotion lags behind such psychological success stories as found in mem- ory, vision, early development, hearing, attention, and so forth. There is a web of directions, not a single path, in the history of emotion.
