# employers can motivate employees and drive worker productivity. Because different

factors influence workers in different ways, employers can utilize motivation strategies

that encompass several techniques. For example, to influence workers who are money

motivated, an employer may implement a daily "spiff" that pays cash instantly to

employees who meet short-term production goals. To achieve long-term production

goals, an employer could implement a program that encourages friendly competition

between workers to meet production numbers. At the conclusion of the program,

employers can publicly recognize top performers for a job well done.
