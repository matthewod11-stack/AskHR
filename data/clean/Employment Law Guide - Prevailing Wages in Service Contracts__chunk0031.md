predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement), as determined by the Department of Labor, for the type of work performed. The Wage and Hour Division accepts complaints of alleged SCA violations.

Every employer performing work covered by the SCA is required to provide each employee commencing work

on a covered contract notice of the compensation due them under the wage and fringe beneﬁts provisions of

the SCA and to deliver to the employees, or post, the "Employee Rights on Government Contracts" notice

(including any applicable wage determination) at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place

where it may be easily seen by employees. There are no size requirements for the poster. The Employee Rights on Government Contracts poster is available in Spanish as well.

If the contractor employs workers with disabilities under special minimum wage certiﬁcates, the "Notice to

Workers with Disabilities/Special Minimum Wage (PDF) poster" must also be posted. This poster explains the

conditions under which special minimum wages may be paid. It must be posted in a conspicuous place on

the employer's premises where it can be readily seen by employees and the parents or guardians of workers with disabilities.

Some of the records required to be kept under the SCA are also required under the Fair Labor Standards Act
