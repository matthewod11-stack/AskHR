# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We thank the employees of both companies for their participation in this study. We are grateful for the val- uable comments and feedback from colleagues dur- ing the Harvest Day of the Health, Ethics and Society Department at Maastricht University, particularly from discussants Bart Penders and Ana Pereira Daoud. We also express our appreciation to the organizers of the conference Chronic Living: Quality, Vitality and Health in the 21st Century (held on 4–6 March 2021, hosted by the University of Copenhagen, Denmark) for providing us with the opportunity to present a draft of this paper in the panel ‘Chronic Working: Including Employees and Their Daily Practices and Concerns into Workplace Health Initiatives’.
