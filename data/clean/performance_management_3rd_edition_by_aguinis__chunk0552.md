# 3.3 BUILDING SUPPORT

Given the many competing projects and the usual scarcity of resources, some organiza- tions may be reluctant to implement a performance management system. Primarily, the reason is a lack of any perceived value added to a system that requires many resources (particularly time from supervisors) and that seems to produce little tangible payoffs. The need to align organization and unit priorities with the performance management system is one of the key factors contributing to obtaining the much-needed top manage- ment support for the system.

Top management is likely to ask, “Why is performance management important?” One answer to this question is that performance management is the primary tool that will allow top management to carry out its vision. The performance management sys- tem, when aligned with organization and unit priorities, is a critical tool to (1) allow all employees to understand where the organization stands and where it needs to go and (2) provide tools to employees (e.g., motivation, developmental resources) so that their behaviors and results will help the organization get there. Fundamentally, the implementation of any performance management system requires that the “What’s in it for me?” question be answered convincingly. In the case of top management, the answer to the “What’s in it for me?” question is that performance management can serve as a primary tool to realize its vision.

Building support for the system does not stop with top management, however. All participants in the system need to understand the role they play and receive a clear an- swer to the “What’s in it for me?” question. Communication about the system is key. This includes a clear description of the system’s mechanics (e.g., when the performance planning meetings will take place, how to handle disagreements between supervisor and employees) and the system’s consequences (e.g., relationship between performance evaluation and rewards). As discussed in Chapter 1, not involving people in the process of system design and implementation can create resistance, and the performance management system may result in more harm than good.

Consider the role that good communication played in the launching of a revamped performance management system at Bankers Life and Casualty (http://www.bankerslife.com), an insurance company specializing in insurance for seniors and headquartered in Chicago. In November 2000, Edward M. Berube was appointed as its new president and CEO. Berube understood that Bankers Life and Casualty was facing important challenges, including new customer demands, the impact of the Internet, outsourcing, and increased competition. So, Bankers Life and
