# Implications for practice

The realities of the workplace constrain the use and effectiveness of formal training and development programs.

What antecedents and conditions facilitate continuous learning, especially informal learning, and knowledge sharing? What aspects of human capital resources are influenced by continuous learning and knowledge sharing?

Organizations should develop human capital resources using a broader perspective of learning, including continuous learning, informal learning, and knowledge sharing.

Althoughinvestmentinformaltrainingand development continues, there is increased use of online delivery and instructional methods and mobile learning that provide learners more control over what, where, and when they learn.

How do cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal job demands and interruptions influence the effectiveness of online delivery and instructional methods and mobile learning?

Organizations should pay more attention to facilitating learning and transfer both inside and outside a training and/or development event or program.

Face-to-face or technology-aided knowledge sharing is necessary for transferring expertise and knowledge.

What contributes to knowledge hoarding rather than sharing? How can human resource practices facilitate knowledge sharing?

Organizations should facilitate knowledge sharing among individuals, teams, departments, and divisions to capitalize on existing knowledge-based resources.
