# Practical implications

Active distribution of information of pay system-related issues, such as how decisions are made, may lead to an increased understanding among female employees of their salaries and monetary worth (Barron, 2003). Thus, besides the obvious suggestion of eliminating the gender pay gap between men and women, managers may want to involve their female employees in the design of any improvement of pay systems so that women will have better access to pay information and have an opportunity to see how an even-handed pay system is implemented. There is also a need for management to report information about policies and procedures concerning the gender pay gap. Managerial support of eliminating the gender pay gap may be revealed by employing women to supervisory and leadership positions, and reducing inequalities in work duties and financial outcomes. Moreover, women who are negotiating their salaries might need special training to ask for a higher salary than originally planned and to focus on the reasons they are entitled to this salary. Women should be aware of the gender pay gap and, thus, try their best not to accept such situations in their workplaces.
