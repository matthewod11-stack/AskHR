Sweta Kumari, Associate Professor Department of ISME,ATLAS SkillTech University, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India Email Id-sweta.kumari@atlasuniversity.edu.in

ABSTRACT:

"Job Satisfaction and Engagement" are two critical aspects of employee well-being and organizational success. Job satisfaction refers to an employee's contentment with their job, encompassing factors such as work environment, compensation, and relationships with colleagues. When employees are satisfied with their jobs, they tend to be more committed, productive, and less likely to leave their positions, benefiting the organization in terms of reduced turnover and increased performance. On the other hand, engagement goes beyond satisfaction, focusing on the emotional connection and enthusiasm employees have for their work. Engaged employees are passionate, motivated, and willing to go the extra mile, contributing to higher levels of innovation and customer satisfaction. Organizations that prioritize both job satisfaction and engagement not only create a more positive work environment but also enjoy improved bottom-line results, making these topics essential considerations for modern HR and management practices.
