The Rephraser Agent is specialized in adapting the tone, style, and presentation of responses

to match user preferences and context. This agent transforms technical information into

conversational language, adjusts response length based on driving conditions and urgency,

personalizes communication style to match user preferences, and formats complex

information for easier comprehension while driving.
