# Rise of Experts

Compulsory schooling thus created a major community set- ting, the school, within which psychologists could choose to work. This was as signiﬁcant to the future of school psychol- ogy as the promise of the Community Mental Health Centers Act of the 1960s was to clinical and counseling psychology. Moreover, the conditions of the children placed demands on educators that would require the addition of specialized personnel in several ﬁelds, including school psychology. These ﬁelds would soon be referred to collectively as pupil personnel services and would include attendance ofﬁcers, truant ofﬁcers, social workers, guidance counselors, voca- tional counselors, school health workers including nurses and physicians, speech and language clinicians, and psycholo- gists. Schooling had not only become formalized outside of the home, but there were now various experts to assist an increasingly formally trained teaching force. Despite opposi- tion from the scientiﬁc psychology community, the emer- gence of psychological science during this period inﬂuenced the rise of experts in applied psychology. Applied psycholo- gists were part of a growing class of experts in many ﬁelds as knowledge expanded rapidly and one could no longer expect to manage the affairs of life without expert assistance. Real or illusory, this perception grew during the twentieth century, promoting the rise of psychological experts, specializations, and subspecializations.
