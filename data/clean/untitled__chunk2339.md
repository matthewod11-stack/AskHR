# The Hybrid Years

(e.g., defective vision or hearing, adenoids, teeth, lungs). Such conditions quickly led to medical inspections for school entrance. Noting the presence of other disabilities related to school learning (e.g., intelligence, memory, speech, sensa- tion), Wallin called for psychological inspections as well. Wallin reasoned that if the child was to be compelled to at- tend school, then it was the state’s responsibility to provide conditions under which the child could learn the material the state required him or her to learn. Compulsory schooling, which led to the mass education of children, in effect created the conditions under which other forms of educational treat- ments would be needed for children who failed to proﬁt from the regular educational program. Thus was advanced the con- cept and practice of special education and the groundwork for what would become a growing separation of regular and spe- cial education throughout the twentieth century. The growth of special classes, usually segregated from the mainstream of regular education, was gradual but persistent. Dunn (1973) indicates that special education enrollment grew from 26,163 in 1922 to 356,093 in 1948 and to 2,857,551 by 1972. Today more than ﬁve million school children are in special education.
