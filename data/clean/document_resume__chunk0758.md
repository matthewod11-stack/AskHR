## Some uses of objective faculty evaluation data.

1.

FeedbackObjective faculty evaluation data serve as relatively effective feedback from the students to their professors. Teacher evaluation forms enable students to communi- cate ideas to their teachers, to make then teachers aware of particular strengths and weaknesses in their courses and in their teaching methods, and to suggest improvement when necessary. Since learning depends on feedback, this information is essential if professors are to improve their courses and teaching methods in the future. The primary use of faculty rating forms is to provide this important feedback to the indi- vidual faculty members.

Personnel actionsObjective faculty evaluation data, when available, can be used to influence decisions regarding such issues as tenure, promotion, and salary adjustment. Decisions based on objective data are typically fairer than those based on hearsay, reputation, and other "informal" data. Student evaluations of teaching performance are rarely the major cnteria considered when personnel action decisions are made, but they can certainly have some influence.

D. Additional points regarding faculty evaluation

1.

There arc many different duties involved in the job of college professor. While class- room teaching :s not the professor's only responsibility, it is an important part of his/her job. Auburn University lists teaehing as as faculty members' most important duty.

2.

Students are not the only persons whose evaluations of teat hang performance should be sought, but their evaluations should be considered carefully. Students are one of the major consumer groups of the university's expertise and are certainly affected by the faculty's performance. Furthermore, whereas deans, department heads, and other faculty members rarely observe professors' teaching performance first-hand, and thus 'ire not in a strong position to provide objective data, students are in an excellent posi- tion to observe and report on faculty teaching behavior.

Teachog is multi-dimensional. There are many facets of teaehing performance and it is probably not possible to take all of them into aeeount in ally one performance measure or rating form. The rating form should, however, Lover as many important teaching behaviors as possible and should certainly provide adequate coverage of the facets it is intended to measure.

The purpose of faculty ,valuation is to improve professors' teaelling performance, not to damage faculty members in any way The process should only be used construc- tively, never destructively.
