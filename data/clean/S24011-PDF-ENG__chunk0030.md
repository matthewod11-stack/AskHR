# Iraq’s aggression in the Middle East.”

Was Gorbachev in that pivotal moment of impasse at lunch having

a crucial conversation with Thatcher? Inﬂuencing her? Inspiring her?

Giving feedback? Building trust? Changing her behavior? He was quite

evidently engaging in all those traditional leadership activities. Yet in

that moment, he was focused on one thing—activating the inner core in

himself and in Thatcher. He did so with a few simple actions.

In emphasizing leadership in the moment, I don’t want to minimize the importance of crafting a planned approach beforehand.
