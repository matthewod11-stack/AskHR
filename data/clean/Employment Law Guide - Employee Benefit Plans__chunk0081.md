Fax requests can be sent to 202-501-4098. Requests should include pertinent information to help ﬁnd

documents, such as titles and dates. For 5500 and report searches, the name of the company/entity, the type of plan, the nine-digit EIN and three-digit Plan Number, state, and year(s) requested should be provided. Also

include the requestor's name, address, and contact information. Summary Plan Descriptions (SPD) are no

longer ﬁled with EBSA. The 1977-1998 collection of SPD records have been transferred to the Pension Beneﬁt

Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) and can be requested by submitting a request to spdrequest@pbgc.gov. Given the complexity of ERISA requirements, employers may wish to seek the assistance of an attorney, CPA ﬁrm,

investment or brokerage ﬁrm, and other employee beneﬁt consultants.
