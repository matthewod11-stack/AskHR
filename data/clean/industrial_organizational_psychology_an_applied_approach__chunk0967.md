# Job Fairs

Job fairs are used by % of organizations (SHRM, b) and are designed to provide information in a personal fashion to as many applicants as possible. Job fairs are typically conducted in one of three ways. In the first, many types of orga- nizations have booths at the same location. For example, a multiemployer job fair in Montgomery, Alabama, drew nearly , applicants and  employers (Dugan, ). Your college probably has one or two of these job fairs each year, in which dozens of organizations send representatives to discuss employment opportunities with students and to collect résumés. In addition, representatives usually hand out company literature and souvenirs such as T-shirts, yardsticks, and cups. If you haven’t been to a campus job fair, contact your career services center to see when they are scheduled on your campus.

Job fairs are also held when an event or disaster occurs that affects local employment. Following the September , , attack on the World Trade Center, a job fair for displaced workers attracted more than , job seekers. Similar fairs were held for airline workers in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh (Gelbart, ). Similarly, in the rebuilding process in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a multiemployer job fair called “West of the Connection” was held in the New Orleans area.

The second type of job fair has many organizations in the same field in one location. For example, a technology job fair in New York City in  had  companies represented and attracted more than , potential programmers (Maroney, ). The advantage to this type of job fair is that with a single employment field represented, each visitor is a potential applicant for every

organization. The drawback, of course, is that each organization must compete directly with the other organizations at the fair.

The third approach to a job fair is for an organization to hold its own. Here

are some examples:

Gaylord Palms in Kissimmee, Florida, held a job fair attended by more than , people interested in the resort’s , job openings. The job fair began with an overnight “pajama party” attended by , applicants. First Union Bank held a Thursday job fair that attracted more than  people interested in the bank’s  openings. Microsoft held a job fair in Atlanta that attracted , people, and Concentra Corporation held an “open house” that attracted more than  applicants and resulted in four job openings being filled.

Although this approach is certainly more expensive, it has the advantage of focus- ing the attention of the applicants on only one company.
