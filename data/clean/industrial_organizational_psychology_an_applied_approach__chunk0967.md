Most major newspapers also have their help-wanted ads online. For example, jobs in Atlanta can be viewed on the Web at http://www.aajcclassifieds.com, and jobs in Chicago (through the website of the Sun-Times newspaper) can be viewed at http://searchchicago.suntimesw.com/jobs/index.html.

Though the use of online recruiting and screening has certainly increased, there is little research investigating whether the Internet is an effective recruit- ment source (Hausdorf & Duncan, ). There seems to be little doubt that the Internet generates more applications than more traditional recruiting methods, but the relative quality of those applicants is not known. In the only study to date addressing this issue, McManus and Ferguson () found that Internet sources produced better-quality applicants than did newspaper ads and career fairs and produced similar quality to school placement offices.

As is the case with print media, the look and content of a Web recruitment page or advertisement greatly influences applicant reactions. A study by Dineen, Ling, Ash, and Del Vecchio () found that Web-based job postings were most effective when the posting was aesthetically pleasing and contained customized information about the job and the company. Aesthetics or content by themselves were not enough to influence applicant reactions.

Many organizations are expanding the traditional Web approach by blogging (Hasson, ). Blogging allows recruiters to more informally discuss an organi- zation’s career opportunities and corporate culture with potential applicants. The blog will usually include links to the organization’s official employment website. An example of a blog for T-Mobile can be found at www.wirelessjobs.com and the blog for Honeywell Corp. at www.honeywellblogs.com. Note the vast difference in the style and tone of the two blogs.
