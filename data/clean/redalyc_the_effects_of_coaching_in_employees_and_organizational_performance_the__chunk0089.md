## 5.2 Limitations and future lines of research

This work suffers from a number of limitations that need to be considered to be able to

interpret its conclusions appropriately. We now present these limitations, along with the future

lines of research that they open up. Our main data collection instrument was the

questionnaire, and this suffers from the limitation of subjectivity. The information obtained

could be biased because many items are based on respondents’ perceptions. Another limitation

is that the research is cross-sectional in nature, in other words we obtained the information at

a particular moment in time. Future work should analyze the effect of coaching on individual

and organizational performance over a period of time using longitudinal analysis. This would

isolate temporal phenomena and specific circumstances that can distort the results of the

research. In particular we would advise measuring the impact of coaching on organizational

performance in the medium to long term. This line of research could use autoregressive

longitudinal structural models, which explain the evolution of the variance over time, or MIMIC

models, in which the indicators of the latent variables can be longitudinal.

The scope of analysis of this work comprises the different sectors of the Spanish economy.

Researchers could replicate this study in specific sectors. This could enrich the analysis

because it would limit external influences on performance. Researchers could compare their

results to ours, and compare the results between different sectors.

- 6. Conclusions

We draw upon Joo’s (2005) conceptual model to analyse the effects of coaching in employees

and organizational performance. This work strengthens that framework by incorporating two

theoretical approaches: social exchange theory, which helps explain individual outcomes of the

coaching process, and the RBV, which helps explain the link with organisational performance.

In this way, our research allows to shed light about the benefits of coaching, both for the

individuals that participate in the coaching process as well for the organisation. These results

provide an additional point of view to managers in order to appraisal the benefits of the

coaching process in a wider consideration, both for individuals and firms. On one hand,

managers can realise the benefits of the coaching process for the coachees, which contribute

to take advantage of the potential of the human resources of the firm. On the other hand, a

relevant contribution of this paper is the positive effect of coaching process in the organisation,

which can be measured in terms of firm performance and growth. Obviously, these benefits of

coaching process are not reached in every company as a universal rule, because of the costs of

the process that must be overcome by the benefits. In this sense, we offer some
