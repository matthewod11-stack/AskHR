## The Rise of Industrial-Organizational Psychology

Training at the Master’s Level in Industrial/Organizational Psychology (Society for Industrial and Organizational Psy- chology, Inc., 1995) and the Guidelines for Education and Training at the Doctoral Level in Industrial/Organizational Psychology (Society for Industrial and Organizational Psy- chology, Inc., 1998b). Challenges about maintaining the scientist-practitioner model in a highly diverse and special- ized ﬁeld were expressed recently (Downey, 2000). In addi- tion, concerns were raised about the future of I-O psychology programs because many academic I-O psychologists are seeking employment in business schools rather than psychol- ogy departments due to higher salaries for business-related faculty appointments (DeNisi, 2000; Downey, 2000).
