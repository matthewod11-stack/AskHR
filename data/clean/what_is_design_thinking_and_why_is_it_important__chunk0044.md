# Novice Versus Expert Design Thinker

In general, a good designer should be able to flexibly use different problem- solving strategies and choose the one that best meets the requirements of the situation (Akin & Akin, 1996; Eisentraut, 1999; Weth, 1999). Regardless of the given prob- lem, successful designers clarify requirements, actively search for information (i.e., critically check given requirements and question their own requirements), summa- rize information of the problem into requirements and partially prioritize them, and do not suppress first solution ideas (Badke-Schaub, 1999; Fricke, 1999).

According to Nigel (2004), novice behavior is usually associated with a depth- first approach to problem solving, that is, identifying and exploring sub-solutions in depth and sequentially. The strategies of experts are usually regarded as being predominantly top-down, breadth-first approaches. The expert designer uses explicit problem decomposing strategies, which the novice designer does not pos- sess. In 2001, Ho examined the search strategies used by expert and novice design- ers in solving problems in industrial design. Using protocol analysis, the researcher found that the novice participant focused only on the surface level without decom- posing the problem, while the expert used explicit problem decomposing
