When workers solve for optimal effort, extra utility from an “earned-income bonus”

is like an increase in performance-based pay (a bonus return to effort), except that

the incentive is entirely internal. How such a “pride bonus” interacts with sorting

and with optimal wage and promotion policies is an interesting open question.

A broader point is that the process by which wages and other organizational out-

comes are determined (particularly terminations) may affect how people value the

consequences, In organizational studies this phenomenon is Called “procedural jus-

tice,” and it is argued that itis important empirically (Brockner and Wiesenfeld 1996;

Tyler 2001). One component of procedural justice is the desire to have a voice or

participate in important decisions that affect you. Another component is consistency

of procedures. People dislike not knowing the rules that are being applied to judge

them. The taste for clear rules motivates bright-line rules like seniority-based firing

policies, and many policies in employment law. Of course, a taste for procedural jus-

tice is often hard to distinguish from standard preferences. For example, the desire

to “have a voice” could just reflect the attempt to achieve individually favorable

rules. Clear rules may simply help workers to optimize their effort allocation and

reduce influence costs. Moreover, we may worry that procedural concerns, even if

we could identify them, are second-order compared with wages. For example, while

people may complain that a coworker was unfairly fired, will they actually quit their

own job in protest, or accept a wage cut to get the coworker reinstated? Experiments

suggest they might. But we would need more empirical research, tied to economic

models, to calibrate the taste for procedural justice by pitting it against money in
