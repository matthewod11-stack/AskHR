## hopefully tens of thousands, if not millions of people.

ADI IGNATIUS:

How has your life changed since you published the book? I mean, now

you’re sort of out there as an authority. Has that changed your life?

DEB LIU:

My life is: before running in here, I was literally cooking lunch for my

family. So I feel like in some ways, having a family of three, with three

kids and my husband and my mom who has cancer living with us, has

kept me humble. And in fact, it reminds me that so much of our life is

not lived like what you see on social media, right? The successes, getting

the amazing job, or joining X board, or getting your book published,

[but] so much of life is actually the day to day, which is what keeps me,

reminds me, that we can have inﬂuence in small ways and big ways.
