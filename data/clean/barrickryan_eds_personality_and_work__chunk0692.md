# Person-by-Situation Effects

In a review of the training ﬁeld over thirty years ago, Campbell (1971) noted that one area of promise was the focus on person-by- situation effects, which take both individual differences and learn- ing situations into account. In particular, he directed attention to the problem of how to adapt the instructional process to individ- ual differences as an alternative to research examining trait effects on learning outcomes directly, without examining the training con- tent and process. Campbell’s approach is quite sensible because traits are more proximal to learning behaviors and the learning process that instruction entails, and they are more distal from the outcomes that the learning situation demands of the individual.

According to Cronbach (1957, 1967), individual differences and learning can relate to one another by tailoring a set of instructional goals, methods, and materials to the individual or to homogeneous groups of individuals. Typically, this sort of research has sought to investigate the effects of matching alternative modes of instruction to different characteristics of the individual so that each person uses the most appropriate learning procedure. In this context, aptitude is deﬁned as any stable characteristic that resides within the individ- ual, interacts with learning situations, and correlates with learning outcomes. Deﬁned in this way, aptitudes are broad in scope and in- clude cognitive, motivational, and affective factors such as cognitive
