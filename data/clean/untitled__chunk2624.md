suited to meet in a practical way the tasks that every citizen knows how to deﬁne. But it could also produce products who could break up these problems and approach them from a point of view off the cultural map commonly believed in.

Kulik’s (1973) national survey of undergraduate departments and their highly diverse curricula led him to conclude:

It is an empirical question whether curricula like those of liberal arts colleges best meet the ideals of liberal education. Is it con- ceivable that for some students, occupationally oriented pro- grams may provide a better road to personal soundness than the traditional curricula of liberal arts colleges? (p. 202)

Developing courses that incorporated the expanding knowledge base and met the needs of changing student populations led to “academic shopping center” curricula (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 1977, p. 5). The upside was that our discipline caught the imagination of so many of the new students, especially women, who came to higher education during the 1960s and 1970s. Faculty charged with thinking about undergraduate education from a national (versus local) perspective made every effort to transform the “shopping center” of courses into a coherent discipline. Kulik’s (1973) conclusion was an insightful one and would become an important agenda into the 1990s: “The diverse goals of students in psychology courses suggest that pluralism may be a valuable concept in the design of programs in psychology” (p. 203).

As 1 of 12 learned-society task forces in the Association of American Colleges project on the arts and sciences major, McGovern et al. (1991) identiﬁed objectives for undergradu- ate psychology. The authors proposed eight common goals for the diversity of settings, students, and courses that char- acterized psychology:

- 1. Knowledge base. 2. Thinking skills. 3. Language skills. 4. Information gathering and synthesis skills. 5. Research methods and statistical skills. 6. Interpersonal skills. 7. History of psychology. 8. Ethics and values.
