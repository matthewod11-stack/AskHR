## such a request might not literally "oppose" discrimination or "participate" in

the administrative or judicial complaint process, s/he is protected against

retaliation for making the request" ("EEOC Compliance Manual" 1998).

1.3. Charging party who is female is interested in a position with the

accounting department which requires a CPA license, which she does not

have, yet her competition who is male, has a license. Charging party informs

her supervisor that she was discriminated against because of her gender.

Charging party new it was essential to have a CPA to perform the job. In

this situation charging party did not engage in protected opposition and

there was no good faith and no reason to believe she was rejected because of

her gender ("EEOC Compliance Manual" 1998). I would like to add the

CPA can be classified as a bona fide occupation qualification, and based on

this perspective, charging party does have a case.

1.4. "Charging party filed a charge alleging that he was racially harassed by

his supervisor and co-worker. After learning about the charge, CP's

1.5. A female who files a charge claiming she was denied a position as a result of

her gender. At lunchtime a few weeks later, her supervisor invites some

does meet the criteria for retaliation because there is no reasonable action

likely to deter protected activity.

1.6.

Charging party files a charge against respondent A, alleging that her

supervisor sexually harassed her and discharged her. The respondent was

sued by charging party and a settlement was reached. Afterwards, in

applying for a new position with respondent B, she received an offer that

based on reference check. Respondent B called Respondent A. The former

supervi_sor states that the ch::irging p::irty was a troublerrmlcer that -filed a sexual

harassment lawsuit. Based off this reference B did not hire the

employee in question. However, foul play was suspected based on her

former supervisors reference. She then files a retaliation charge against A

and B. During the EEOC investigation evidence is found by means of

memos and phone conversation between A and B. The notes obtained

clearly prove that A told B about protected activity and that a negative

reference was given based on protected activity. B gave a conditional job

offer pending a reference check and later pulled the offer after learning about

protected activity is strong circumstantial evidence ofB's retaliation
