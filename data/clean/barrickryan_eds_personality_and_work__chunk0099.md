## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 11

ing and found in Tellegen & Waller, 1987) or Attractiveness (found in the other two studies).

Intriguingly, studies in two other languages with broad variable- selection criteria have led to an alternative seven-factor structure. The convergences between these studies occurred in spite of their many differences in methodology. Lexical studies in Filipino (Church et al., 1997, 1998) and Hebrew (Almagor, Tellegen, & Waller, 1995)—languages from widely separated language families and cultures—yielded a highly convergent seven-factor structure, although the similarity was obscured by discrepant labels. The En- glish translations of marker adjectives for the Filipino and Hebrew factors have been shown to correspond in a one-to-one way (Sau- cier, 2002).

One of these new factors resembles the Negative Valence factor just described. Two of them resemble Big Five factors—Consci- entiousness and Intellect. The other three Big Five factors— Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability—correlate substantially but in a complex way with the remaining four factors, which map an affective-interpersonal domain (compare Saucier, 1992). These four can be labeled Gregariousness (or Liveliness), Self-Assurance (or Mettle or Fortitude), Even Temper (Tolerant ver- sus Temperamental), and Concern for Others (versus Egotism). Big Five Extraversion is related to Gregariousness and Self-Assurance, Emotional Stability to Self-Assurance and Even Temper, and Agree- ableness to Even Temper and Concern for Others.

Similar factors have been obtained from lexical data in English (Saucier, 2002), and factors found in studies in Italian (Di Blas & Forzi, 1998) resemble the Multi-Language Seven. However, further replication tests are needed because few studies have used such in- clusive variable-selection criteria. In any case, one would expect a model with more factors to have higher predictive validity, and there are some indications that this Multi-Language Seven model will outperform the Big Five in this regard (Saucier, 2002).
