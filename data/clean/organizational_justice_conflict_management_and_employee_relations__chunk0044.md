functioning of organizations (Moye and Henkin, 2006). A trusting climate also reinforces cooperation (Wong et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2015), motivation (Audenaert et al., 2016), job satisfaction, well-being of employees (Gill, 2008; Leat and El-Kot, 2009), commitment and organizational effectiveness (Farndale et al., 2011).

2.5 Organizational justice and ER Justice is a vital component of the organization that sparks employeesâ€™ identity and emotional attachment to the employer (Poon, 2012). It encourages the evolution of social exchange relationships that in turn spur employees to develop better organizational behavior. Scholars have stated that organizational justice is beneficial as well as fundamental to both employers and employees (Cropanzano et al., 2002; Swalhi et al., 2017). It was empirically evidenced that organizational justice significantly affects the relationship between organization and employees (Kim et al., 2017). This study was conducted in the South Korean organizations by addressing only two dimensions such as trust and satisfaction. Although this relationship was empirically evidenced, its implication in the scope of power sector was lacking. Thus, the present study attempted to extend the previous one by incorporating the multiple dimensions of fairness in reward system, organizational practices, respectful treatment, work schedule and promotion to investigate the association between organizational justice and ER in the context of the power sector. Researchers have stated that organizational justice binds people together to perform effectively and develops the relationships among the co-workers, employers and employees (Cropanzano et al., 2002; Forret and Sue Love, 2008; Fein et al., 2013). Thus, based on the above discussions, it can be hypothesized that:

H1. Organizational justice will have a significant impact on ER.

2.6 Conflict management and ER The sustenance of organizational efficiency and effectiveness can be accomplished when the workplace conflicts are to be managed constructively (Hempel et al., 2009; Leung, 2008). Basically, individuals experience interpersonal conflicts within the organization. Today, it is a challenging task for the managers to manage the conflicts amicably, rather than avoiding them. Effective management of conflicts will encourage cooperation and mutual trust among the organizational members and also promote their relationship (Chen et al., 2005; Posthuma, 2011). Conflict is a constructive force, as it provides the opportunity to share ideas and valuable suggestions; thus, the channel of communication between employer and employees is enhanced. This will create a conducive environment for the individuals to get to know each other better and improve their relationships quality (Tjosvold et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005). Although the existing literature offers sufficient theoretical explanation about the relationship between conflict management and ER, it lacks empirical validation. This gap instigates the authors to make a novel attempt by addressing multiple dimensions of conflict management to flourish a healthy ER in the power sector. Hence, the following hypothesis can be proposed as:

H2. Conflict management will have a significant impact on ER.

2.7 Organizational justice and climate of trust Trust is extensively considered as an important phenomenon in the organizational work setting that facilitates supportive and cooperative behavior and mutual understanding among the employees (Cropanzano et al., 2007). When employees received just and fair treatment by the organization, they demonstrate a high level of trust (Zhang and Agarwal, 2009; Vanhala and Ahteela, 2011; Gaudencio et al., 2017). Researchers and scholars have
