# the truth.

And the truth is — it takes hard work in ways that might surprise you.

Why? Because many people misunderstand what coaching is,

underestimate the process to become a credentialed coach, and don’t

anticipate the ongoing eﬀort required to generate and develop business

to make a living doing this work.

The ﬁve of us have approximately 60 years of collective coaching

experience and we all really, really love what we do. But each of us has

our own “secret sauce” to building these rewarding coaching careers;

there’s no single playbook. How many clients should you have? What

other income streams should you consider? How many hours per day

should you coach? How do you get clients (and keep them)? And most

importantly, how hard is it? We want to give you some clarity so that you

can fulﬁll your own coaching dream.
