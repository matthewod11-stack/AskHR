chapter 

nominal groups appear to perform at equal levels when the groups are small, but electronic groups are superior when the group is large.

The superiority of nominal groups over interacting groups may depend on the type of task. Brophy () found nominal groups to be most effective with a single brainstorming problem and interacting groups to be most effective with complex problems. Similar results were reported by Davis and Harless (), who found that with complex problems, interacting groups take better advantage of feedback and learning and thus outperform nominal groups.

An interesting aspect of interacting groups is the tendency for groups to take more extreme positions than the positions of individual members. This tendency, called group polarization, suggests that group members will shift their beliefs to a more extreme version of what they already believe individually, That is, if individual group members are on the risky side, the group will make highly risky decisions. If, however, the individual members are conservative or cautious, the group as a whole will be extremely cautious (Isenberg, ).

The tendency to make more risky decisions was demonstrated in a particu- larly interesting piece of research by Cromwell, Marks, Olson, and Avary () who found that burglars committed more crimes when working as part of a group than when working alone. Another example of increased group riskiness comes from a brokerage firm that was interested in getting its brokers to make riskier but higher-yielding investments. A consulting firm was asked to develop a way to select such brokers. Using its knowledge of group dynamics, the consulting firm told the brokerage company that it could obtain better results by having its bro- kers make investment decisions in groups rather than individually. Implementing this suggestion, the company later reported that its brokers were indeed making riskier investments.

Although the research seems to conclude that interacting groups offer no performance improvement over nominal groups, Wilson () has criticized this conclusion because it flies in the face of evolutionary research that demonstrates the value of groups in most species. He believes that a problem with previous group research is that the tasks were too easy and that when a task is difficult, interacting groups are superior to nominal groups.

Now that you have a good understanding of group dynamics, let’s focus on a spe- cific type of group behavior that occurs in work teams. The concept of employee work teams has been around for decades (they were often called “quality circles” in the s), but their use has greatly increased in the s. Surveys indicate that % of Fortune  companies use teams (Lawler, ).

Unfortunately, this increase in the use of teams is often the result of “keep- ing up with the Joneses” rather than a strategically planned method of organi- zation development. As with any type of organizational intervention, teams can improve performance in some, but not all, situations. Teams work best in situa- tions in which (a) the job requires high levels of employee interaction, (b) a team approach will simplify the job, (c) a team can do something an individual cannot, and (d) there is time to create a team and properly train team members (Kriegel & Brandt, ).
