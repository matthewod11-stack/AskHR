are better predictors of performance in higher-level positions than are future- focused questions (Huffcutt, Roth, Conway, & Klehe, ; Huffcutt, Weekley, Wiesner, DeGroot, & Jones, ; Pulakos & Schmitt, ). Rather than trying to predict future performance,

organizational-fit questions tap the extent to which an applicant will fit into the culture of an orga- nization or with the leadership style of a particular supervisor. For example, some organizations are very policy oriented, whereas others encourage employees to use their initiative. Some supervisors are very task oriented, whereas others are more person oriented. The idea behind organizational-fit questions is to make sure that the applicant’s personality and goals are consistent with those of the organization. To practice creating interview questions, complete Exercise . in your workbook.

Creating a Scoring Key for Interview Answers Once interview questions are created, the next step is to create a key to score applicants’ answers to the questions. Though answers to some questions can be scored as being right or wrong (e.g., “Do you have to pay an employee overtime for working over  hours in a day?”), as shown in Table ., there are three main methods of scoring most answers: right/wrong, typical-answer approach, and key-issues approach.

Right/Wrong Approach. Some interview questions, especially skill-level determiners, can be scored simply on the basis of whether the answer given was correct or incorrect. For example, consider the question “As a server, can you give a glass of wine to a -year-old if his parents are present and give permission?” If the interviewee answers no, she would get a point for a correct answer. If she answers yes, she would not get a point. If the question type being asked was a disqualifier (e.g., Can you work weekends?), the wrong answer would actually disqualify the individual from further consideration rather than merely result in no points being awarded.
