# Meta-Analytic Procedures

Computations for the overall meta-analysis and subsequent analyses were performed using Johnsonâ€™s (1993) DSTAT computer program, which applies the Hedges and Olkin (1985) approach. We computed the sample- size-weighted mean of each set of correlations and the corresponding confidence intervals. Following the recommendations of Hunter and Schmidt (1990) and Hedges and Olkin (1985), we also calculated the estimate of the true correlation (rho). To calculate an estimate of rho for each analysis, we corrected each effect size for attenuation due to unreli- ability in trust and in the other variable. In the infrequent cases where reliability statistics were not reported by a study, we followed the common practice of substituting the mean reliability of the sample of studies.
