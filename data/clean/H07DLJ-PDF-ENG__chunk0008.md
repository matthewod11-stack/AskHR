# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

the small things being: for every 100 men that are promoted into

management, only 86 women are.

We don’t tell the other 14 women that they didn’t get promoted because

they’re a woman like they might have done 20, 30, 40 years ago. But

instead, there’s these subtle stumbling blocks that we’re facing. And

the challenge now is rather than having something to point to, is that

if you’re one of those women that didn’t make it, you always wonder,

“Is it me? Could I have done something diﬀerent?” When actually,

structurally, the system is a little bit set up so that there’s a slightly tilted

playing ﬁeld. And yet, that small slight change makes a huge diﬀerence

in the lives of the women that actually face it.

ADI IGNATIUS:

This is Harvard Business Review’s 100th anniversary, and as part of

the celebration we’ve been talking about some of the great articles

that we’ve published and that have had the most impact. We’ve also

unearthed some of the howlers that we’re frankly embarrassed about.

And it took us a long time to start to get gender right. I was recently at

a public event on stage, and I read from a 1956 article that talked about

how women needed to support their husband’s career, and they should

tolerate and even encourage their husband to work late, to go on trips.

And then speaking to the husband, it sort of said that you might just

need to ﬁnd a new wife who will accommodate this lifestyle. This is

1956, I wasn’t in the job then, but we did publish it and have to own it.

So there is a lot of progress. And yet, I think a lot of women feel a lot

of frustration still in the workplace. You’ve decided to write this book

even as you are CEO of a nearly $5 billion corporation. What was the

calculation there to try to be able to do both?
