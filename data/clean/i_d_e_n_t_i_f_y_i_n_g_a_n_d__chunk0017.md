# Navigating ambiguity

Knowledge work often involves ambiguity and open-ended challenges. Employees may struggle to get started or become blocked, causing projects to stall. Here AI can act as a catalyst, helping to generate ideas, analyze data, and propose next steps when the path is unclear."

People across all the companies we spoke to are using AI to kick-start their thinking and unblock new ideas. They’re using it to brainstorm campaign ideas, look for quick insights in raw data, analyze trends, or just (cid:12)gure out next steps when they’re not sure what to do.

Our marketing team brainstorms campaign ideas with voice mode in ChatGPT to unblock creativity and start working towards a brief.

Focusing on these types of work can help you quickly identify high-impact AI opportunities, helping your teams optimize workbows, reduce bottlenecks, and speed up innovation across your organization.
