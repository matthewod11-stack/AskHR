## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 151

member viewed by the organization as contrary to its legitimate interests (Sackett & DeVore, 2001). We distinguish counterpro- ductive behavior from counterproductivity, viewing the latter as the tangible outcomes of counterproductive behavior. We view counterproductive behavior as a facet of job performance and performance as reﬂecting behaviors rather than outcomes. For example, in a given time period, violation of safety procedures (behaviors) may not result in any injuries (outcomes), thus illus- trating the distinction between counterproductive behavior and counterproductivity.

This deﬁnition of CWB takes the perspective of the organization. Thus, a behavior can be performed by many employees in an orga- nization (for example, a setting where taking sick leave when not ac- tually sick has become widespread), and hence the behavior is not deviant in the norm-violation sense; nevertheless, the organization may view the behavior as contrary to its legitimate interests.

CWBs encompass a broad number of categories of behaviors. Gruys (2000) sorted behaviors in the literature into eleven categories:

- Theft and related behavior • Destruction of property • Misuse of information (reveal conﬁdential information; falsify records)

- Misuse of time and resources (waste time, alter time card, con- duct personal business during work time)

- Unsafe behavior • Poor attendance • Poor-quality work (intentionally slow or sloppy work) • Alcohol use • Drug use • Inappropriate verbal actions (argue with customers; verbally harass coworkers)

- Inappropriate physical actions (physically attack coworkers; physical sexual advances toward coworker)

This list is presented to give a sense of the range of behaviors
