## processor’s immediate attention, and the machine halts normal

operations and jumps the urgent issue to the head of the processing

queue. Like computer processors, team leaders have quite a few things

that demand their attention and force them to act. Many of them are

problems. If you see something go oﬀ the rails—a poorly handled call,

a missed meeting, a project gone awry—the instinct will kick in to stop

everything to tell someone what she did wrong and what she needs to do

to ﬁx it. This instinct is by no means misguided: If your team member

screws something up, you have to deal with it. But remember that when

you do, you’re merely remediating—and that remediating not only

inhibits learning but also gets you no closer to excellent performance.

As we’ve seen, conjuring excellence from your team members requires

a diﬀerent focus from you. If you see somebody doing something that

really works, stopping her and dissecting it with her isn’t only a high-

priority interrupt, it is your highest-priority interrupt. As you replay

each small moment of excellence to your team member, you’ll ease her

into the “rest and digest” state of mind. Her understanding of what

excellence looks and feels like within her will become more vivid, her

brain will become more receptive to new information and will make

connections to other inputs found in other regions of her brain, and she

will learn and grow and get better.

Explore the present, past, and future. When people come to you asking

for feedback on their performance or what they might need to ﬁx to get

promoted, try this:

Start with the present. If a team member approaches you with a

problem, he’s dealing with it now. He’s feeling weak or challenged, and

you have to address that. But rather than tackling the problem head-on,

ask your colleague to tell you three things that are working for him right

now. These things might be related to the situation or entirely separate.

They might be signiﬁcant or trivial. Just ask the question, and you’re
