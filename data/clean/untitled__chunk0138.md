# 2 Psychology as a Science

by arguing that it was not inherently more problematic than observing external phenomena; if introspection was unre- liable,atleastitwasnotanymoresothananyotherkindofob- the same time, Johann Friederich Herbart servation. At (1776–1841) offered a system of psychology that was both empiricalandmathematical.Ifpsychologyneededtobemath- ematical to be a true science, Herbart proposed that numbers could be assigned to mental events of different intensities and a mathematical description of the relationship among them could be formulated. Herbart could assign numbers to describe experiences of different intensities, but he could not actually measure the subjective intensities in accord with an objective standard. Eduard Friederich Beneke (1798–1854) argued that it was premature to apply mathematics to relation- ships among mental events absent more accurate empirical observations and reliable means of measurement; psychology could hope to become an experimental discipline by testing “empiricalresultsandtheoreticalhypothesesundercontrolled conditions and with the systematic variation of variables” (Leary, 1978, p. 119).

Kant’s suggestion that psychology should utilize observa- tions of human beings in their social environment, the rescue by Fries of introspection as a method for observing internal events, Herbart’s suggestion that psychological phenomena could, in principle, be described mathematically, and Beneke’s suggestion that psychological experiments were possible contributed to the inception of scientiﬁc psychology. By sug- gesting that a science of psychology was not possible, Kant stimulated both counterarguments and the search for the means to make psychology a scientiﬁc discipline of equal rank with the natural sciences. It remained for others to attempt to es- tablish introspection as a scientiﬁc method, to devise the con- ditions and methods of an experiment in psychology, and to quantify psychological phenomena and formulate theoretical and mathematical descriptions of the relationships among them.
