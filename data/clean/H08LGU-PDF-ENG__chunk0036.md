## on people’s feelings and experiences within an environment. We can

ask about their experiences with physical and psychological safety,

their comfort reporting and seeking out support for discrimination if

it occurs, and their feelings of respect or disrespect while at work.

If we ﬁnd major diﬀerences in experience — for example, LGBTQ+

workers report experiencing physical harassment more frequently

than their non-LGBTQ+ colleagues do — we can investigate potential

exclusion, oﬀer feedback and accountability to those involved, and

make corrections to the environment to ﬁx the problem.
