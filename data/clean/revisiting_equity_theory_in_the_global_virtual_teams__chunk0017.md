# Step 1:

Identify Benevolents, Equity Sensitives and Entitleds in our sample, calculating O/I for all the teammates; calculate (median O/I) at the team level. If O/I > (median O/I) → Benevolent (“givers”): those who prefer their outcome/input ratios to be less than the outcome/input ratios of the team median. If O/I = (median O/I) → Equity Sensitive: those who conform to the traditional equity norm and prefer their outcome/input ratios to be equal to the team median. If O/I < (median O/I) → Entitled: those who prefer their outcome/input ratios to exceed ratios of the team median.
