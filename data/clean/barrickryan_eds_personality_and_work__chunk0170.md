Depending on the nature of the job in which a worker is engaged, creativity may be a powerful predictor of employee productivity. Individuals who can think of novel solutions to a problem or in- novative strategies for accomplishing a task can greatly increase the productivity and efÔ¨Åciency of the organization where they work. Considerable evidence from laboratory studies shows that induced positive affect can lead to increased creativity. Isen and her col- leagues have shown that inducing a pleasant mood leads to higher scores on the Remote Associates Test (which tests the associations one makes among three seemingly unrelated words; Estrada, Isen, & Young, 1994) and to more unusual responses in a word associa- tion task (Isen, Johnson, Mertz, & Robinson, 1985). Other re- searchers have shown that induced positive affect leads to the use of more creative strategies when estimating correlations (Sinclair & Mark, 1995), the listing of more unusual categories in a sorting task (Hirt, Melton, McDonald, & Harackiewicz, 1996; Murray, Sujan, Hirt, & Sujan, 1990), and the listing of more unusual ex- emplars of a category (Greene & Noice, 1988). Positive affective dispositions seem to have similar effects in laboratory tests of cre- ativity: Cacha (1976) found that happy, relaxed, and bold children tended to score high in creativity.

When we move outside the laboratory, the evidence is slightly more complicated. A number of researchers have noted that creative
