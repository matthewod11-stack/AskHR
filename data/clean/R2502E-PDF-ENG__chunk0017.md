Diversity. People are more likely to learn new things and be innovative

and creative when they have colleagues who diﬀer from them.

Organizations with leadership teams that reﬂect diverse cultures

and genders are more likely to make better decisions and be open

to continuous improvement, which can increase their employees’

experience capital. (Note that we’ve found only that these beneﬁts are

correlated with diversity; it’s not possible to put a company through a

double-blind test to prove causation.)
