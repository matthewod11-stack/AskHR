# consumer discovery.

Digital conglomerates such as Kakao, whose services span messaging,

gaming, mobility, and media, oﬀer a wide range of social-ﬁrst

approaches to the marketplace. Consider KakaoTalk Gift, a service

enabling users to instantly buy and deliver gifts to one’s online

friends and connections, making new brand discovery more exciting

and accelerating adoption. From Starbucks to Amorepaciﬁc, brands

increasingly leverage this more than $2 billion market to boost product

discovery through the gifting lens. In addition, shaping consumer

conversations early on gives K-brands an edge in the competition for

consumer attention and helps them to embed new products in everyday

life, a tendency boosted by astute product placement in K-drama.

Besides digital solutions, K-brands also excel at using concept stores

as powerful discovery tools. They frequently use art exhibitions and

unexpected installations to trigger highly Instagrammable product

discovery and stand out from competition. Consider eyewear Korean

brand Gentle Monster, whose revenues jumped from $140 million

in 2017 to $306 million in 2020. Inspired by CEO and co-founder

Hankook Kim’s conviction that “retail is driven by humans’ curiosity,”

its dazzling retail stores feature catchy, short-lived art installations to

trigger consumer discovery by captivating visitors.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that the Korean ecosystem itself makes

discovery faster. Take Naver, one of the top two online search engines

in Korea. Its algorithm places greater weight on how recent content is,

which means new pages show up higher on the list of search results.

This design increases the visibility of innovations, making it easier
