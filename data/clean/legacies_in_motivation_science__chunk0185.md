# Learning Versus Performance Goals

When participants were given a task that ex- ceeded their knowledge or ability, a moderator in the goal setting theory, participants with a do-your-best goal had higher performance than those assigned performance goals. People who were given high goals under time pressure typ- ically failed to explore alternative strategies. The best procedure here is to assign speciﬁc, challenging learning goals (Seijts, Latham, & Woodwark, 2013; Winters et al., 1996). Self- efﬁcacy and strategies mediate learning goal effects. Learning goals are especially effective when negative feedback is given on the perfor- mance of a task that is experienced as highly complex (Cianci, Klein, & Seijts, 2010). Learn- ing and performance goals actually can be as- signed together so long as the cognitive load is not too high (Masuda, Locke, & Williams, 2015).
