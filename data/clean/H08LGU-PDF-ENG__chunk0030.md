If we ﬁnd major diﬀerences in experience — for example, workers

with children are not attending a monthly networking event because

it takes place during typical daycare pick-up hours — we can investigate

potential inaccessibility, and make corrections to the product, service,

experience, or environment to ﬁx the problem.

and approve sloppy shortcuts that don’t solve the root cause of

inaccessibility. Imagine a building manager who, instead of installing

a ramp to make an entrance accessible, tasks a staﬀ member with

manually pushing wheelchair users up the stairs. Because the needs
