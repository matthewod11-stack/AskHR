found that the main task of supervisors with remote workers is to keep

them connected and updated on what’s happening in the oﬃce; what

Virtual companies such as Atlassian go to great lengths to make

everything transparent. They document everything with a single,

deﬁnitive online ledger that lets employees see where projects

stand, what the performance objectives are, what is changing in the organization that might aﬀect their jobs, and so forth.
