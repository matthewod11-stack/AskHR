# Enroll students.

Invite managers across your organization to enroll as students in

a leadership-readiness program. The invitation should be inclusive,

because leaders can come from all ranks and any sector. Enrollment

must be voluntary, because the Ô¨Årst step in becoming a leader is to

choose to take the step. If you notice that parts of your organization

are underrepresented or that a manager with leadership potential is not

volunteering, ask a cadre member to encourage participation.
