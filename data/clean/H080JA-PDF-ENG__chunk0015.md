## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Redefine Our Gendered Idea of “Ambition”

later stages of pregnancy. At the same time, they began to have regular

career conversations, which reassured her that she would be able to

resume climbing the management ladder when she was ready.

They offer recognition.

Companies that nominate women for development programs and select

them for visible assignments with no strings attached can keep women

engaged, allow them to grow, and ensure they feel valued. These

companies do not make the pursuit of promotion a condition of

receiving power and inﬂuence.

At a game studio where leaders are working hard to repair the “broken

rung,” a talented client of ours who has two young children asked

to have her scope reduced. Her supervisor, aware of her value and

potential, agreed — but arranged to keep her on the studio’s leadership

team. A year later, the studio head invited her to be his chief of staﬀ, a

critical role that oﬀered her visible recognition and career growth while

accommodating her need for personal ﬂexibility.

They know one is not enough.

Companies with a smart approach to ﬂexible growth know that high

potential junior women don’t just need to see the women above

them succeeding at work. They also need to see them balancing life’s

gendered demands in a way that shows that it’s possible to manage

both work and family. Such women are role models, and they’re key for

inspiring and retaining women with high-career potential.

Unfortunately, there are few exemplars in this space. This is in part

because of what’s sometimes referred to as “maternal-wall bias,” where

women are perceived as less competent once they become pregnant,

take maternity leave, or ﬂex their schedules. Afraid of triggering this

bias, many women mask their maternal status at work — which

indirectly reinforces the male model of ambition.
