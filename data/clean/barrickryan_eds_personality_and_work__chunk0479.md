## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 139

assessments of such things as responsibility, coping potential, and modiﬁability and determines the particular discrete emotions ex- perienced. If these appraisals are integral to the emotion-generation process, then individual differences in appraisal tendencies might also be a place to look for a connection between stable character- istics of individuals and emotional reactions.

Interestingly, as Griner and Smith (2000) have pointed out, al- though an essential element of appraisal theory is to show how dif- ferent people can construe the same situation in different ways, clearly implicating the importance of individual differences in val- ues, needs, and appraisal tendencies, almost all research on ap- praisals has asked about the appraisals directly, ignoring the question of the source of the appraisals. Griner and Smith have begun to rectify that situation by showing that individual differ- ences in afﬁliation motive can inﬂuence the judgment of afﬁliative importance in emotion-eliciting circumstances.

All appraisal researchers suggest that goal structures provide the standards on which events are evaluated in primary appraisal processes (Smith & Kirby, 2001). As such, individual differences in these goal structures can inﬂuence affect-generation processes. Dif- ferent types of goals or goal structures can lead people to interpret the same event as personally relevant or not personally relevant. Some people tend to focus on things that they “ought” to do to avoid negative consequences, while others focus on things they “want” to do to improve themselves (Higgins, 1998). The differ- ences between these broad goals have an impact on the resultant emotions that are experienced (Brockner & Higgins, 2001; Hig- gins, 1998). Goal structures may even change the valence of whether the event is helping one attain one’s goal or hindering it. A person with a focus on learning a task (rather than performing better than others) may see a failure as a challenge (that is, something posi- tive) rather than a failure or hindrance to his or her goal. These interpretations lead to very different emotional reactions. Dweck and her colleagues (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Grant & Dweck, 1999) have come to the conclusion that such goal tendencies are consis- tent across time and can therefore be viewed as precursors to per- sonality traits.

Primary appraisal is thought to be followed by secondary ap- praisal in the generation of discrete emotions. Different theorists
