Train managers intensively Many managers could beneﬁt from basic training in eﬀective coaching,

including how to embed genuine empathy and compassion in the

process. Integrating AI tools will require additional upskilling of

managers. They should be trained not only in technical know-how but

in how to translate AI-generated data sensitively and competently to

employees. AI tools may also prove useful for training new managers by

providing practice cases and other forms of experiential learning.
