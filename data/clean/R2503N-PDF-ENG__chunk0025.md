# accountability.

Be transparent about what you can or cannot act on, and in all cases

explain why. If you’re taking an employee’s suggestion, outline how

you want the team to make it happen. If a requested change can’t be

implemented because of budget constraints, company policy, or other

limitations, acknowledge that reality. Delineating the reasons behind

inaction can open the door to brainstorming alternative approaches.
