Hie effect of the Court' decision \\, as to establish a requirement that if any employment practice or "test" has an adverse impact on members of a protected group, the employer must demonstrate that the practice is valid or job-related 2 The decision also gave the EEOC "Guidelines" essentially the force of law in developing personnel procedures Performance appraisal results, \\, hen used to justify personnel decisions, are clearly covered by Title VII and related laws.

T.1 1973 the court stated in Brito r, Zia Compahl that the organization had violated Title VII when, on the basis of poor performance ratings, it laid off a number of employees The court said the practice was illegal because ; I ) a disproportionate number of Hispanic workers were laid off and (2) the performance appiaisal instrument was not related to important elements of work beim\ an but was based on "the best judgments and opinions of supery isors" and \\, as not administered and scored under controlled and standardized conditions. The decision also clearly established that per- formance ratings were employment "tests."
