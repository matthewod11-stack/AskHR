## conclusions. But a recent replication of Schlenker & Leary’s 1982 study

supported those original ﬁndings. This found that projecting conﬁdence

does lead to positive eﬀects, but only when it is non-comparative. In

other words: praising your competence seems to be ﬁne as long as you

do not claim that others are incompetent.

But why do people view conﬁdent others as more competent, even

when their performance suggests otherwise? One explanation is that

we have a tendency to believe what we are told, and to conﬁrm our

beliefs by selecting information that supports them. The term for this

is conﬁrmation bias. So if you project conﬁdence, others tend to believe

you know what you’re talking about, and they will then ﬁlter ambiguous

information (like how much luck may have helped or hurt you) to ﬁt
