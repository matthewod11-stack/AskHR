# Approaches for Maximizing Prediction

Rather than developing a personality taxonomy based on factor analysis of intercorrelations between scores on personality variables, Hough espouses a nomological–web clustering approach, in which taxons are based on similarities in patterns of relationships with vari- ables outside the personality domain, such as job performance cri- teria (Hough & Ones, 2001; Hough & Furnham, 2002). Hough and Ones (2001) used this approach to propose a working taxonomy of personality variables, based on an extensive review of the literature. They called for other researchers to reﬁne this taxonomy through theory and empirical evidence, creating more useful taxons that will lead to a better understanding of the relationships between per- sonality and performance.

A related approach is the use of compound traits, which are combinations of basic personality traits that do not necessarily co- vary that are put together to maximize the prediction of a speciﬁc criterion construct (Hough & Schneider, 1996). Some examples of compound personality traits that have been found to be valid for predicting their intended criterion construct are integrity (Ones, Viswesvaran, & Schmidt, 1993), customer service orienta- tion (Frei & McDaniel, 1998), employee reliability (Hogan & Hogan, 1989), and managerial potential (Gough, 1984). Hough and Ones (2001) suggested a number of other possible compound traits. The development of their working taxonomy will allow for the creation of compound traits to predict behavior for very spe- ciﬁc or unique situations (Hough & Ones, 2001).
