# Understanding Multi-Agent Architectures

Unlike traditional monolithic AI systems, multi-agent architectures break down a problem

into distinct tasks handled by specialized agents. Each agent operates with defined roles,

interacting dynamically with others to optimize decision-making, knowledge retrieval, and

execution. These architectures enable more structured reasoning, decentralized problem-

solving, and scalable task automation, offering a paradigm shift from single-agent workflows.
