# Build leadership learning cohorts

The ultimate determinant of cross-functional health is the quality of

leadership over the teams that must cooperate to get things done.

Leaders who model empathy, curiosity, proﬁciency with conﬂict, and

a genuine desire to create widespread shared success build the strongest

cross-functional partnerships. But these leadership skills don’t often

come naturally, especially to highly results-oriented leaders who’ve

been raised in overly hierarchical environments.

I’ve found the fastest way to build strong, consistent cross-functional

leaders is to immerse them together in cohorts of leadership

development. In nearly a dozen organizations, we’ve built cohorts of

12–16 leaders who journey together in their own learning and formation

for 6–12 months. The content is focused on key skills and knowledge

they need to drive the shared results their functions must produce.

Recently, we’ve oriented content to how the organization needs to

rethink leadership in a hybrid workplace. Small sub-teams spend time

on real projects aligned to strategic goals that create added value for the

organization, and pairs of “peer-coaches” are assigned to meet weekly

to exchange feedback and advice on identiﬁed development areas. I’ve

found that the relationships that form during these cohort journeys
