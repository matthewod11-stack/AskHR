# 4.2 Measures

Measuring scales were adapted from the literature in coaching and sales management. Employee coaching was measured using 8 items from Ellinger et al. (2003) and performance was measured using 7 items from Fang et al. (2004) scale. Scales were anchored at 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree.
