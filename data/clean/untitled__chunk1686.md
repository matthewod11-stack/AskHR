## MONITORING NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING

As summarized by Boll (1983), neuropsychology emerged both as a discipline and as an area of professional practice. As a discipline, neuropsychology is the ﬁeld of science con- cerned with the study of relationships between brain func- tions and behavior. As applied practice, neuropsychology consists primarily of using various assessment procedures to measure the development and decline of brain functions and their impairment as a consequence of head injury, cere- brovascular accidents (stroke), neoplastic disease (tumors), and other illnesses affecting the central nervous system, of which Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent. The histori- cal highlights of formal neuropsychological assessment clus- ter around the development of the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test and the subsequent emergence of neuropsycho- logical test batteries.
