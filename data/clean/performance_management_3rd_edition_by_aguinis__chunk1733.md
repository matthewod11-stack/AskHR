## Chapter 10 • Reward Systems and Legal Issues

the CP plan will improve the service they offer to customers.12 In fact, a review of several studies concluded that using individual pay incentives increased producti- vity by an average of 30%.13 Similarly, a study of 21 fast-food franchises showed a 30% increase in average profits and a 19% decrease in the drive-through times as a result of the implementation of a CP plan.14 These figures, of course, are averages, and productivity and profits do not necessarily improve by 30% in every case. Recall our discussion in Chapter 4 regarding the determinants of performance. An employee’s performance is determined by the joint effects of declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and motivation. CP plans address the motivational component. In other words, employees are likely to choose to expend effort, choose to expend a high level of effort, and choose to persist in this high level of expenditure of effort in the presence of financial incentives. The fact that employees are trying hard to provide good customer service does not mean, however, that they will necessarily succeed. They still need the declarative and procedural knowledge to do so. If they do not know how to please customers, then they won’t be able to satisfy them no matter how hard they try.

CP plans can help improve the motivation of employees when each of the following

conditions is present:

- 1. Employees see a clear link between their efforts and the resulting performance (expectancy).

- 2. Employees see a clear link between their performance level and the rewards received (instrumentality).

- 3. Employees value the rewards available (valence).

There is a multiplicative relationship among these three determinants of motivation so that
