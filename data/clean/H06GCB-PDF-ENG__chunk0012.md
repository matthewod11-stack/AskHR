## HBR / Digital Article / 7 Strategies to Break Down Silos in Big Meetings

Ask the right questions to generate questions.

Shanna used to solicit questions and, after a pause of about a

microsecond, barrel ahead. She chose a diﬀerent strategy to encourage

interaction. Instead of saying, “Do you have any questions?” consider

asking, “Who has the ﬁrst question?” If there’s silence, follow up with a

joke, “OK, who has the second question?” and then allow the silence to

sit long enough to allow people to come up with rich queries. Shanna

learned not to ﬁll silences and to ask more questions of her audience

instead of the presenter. For example, “If a developer on your team

heard this sales presentation, what questions would they have?” or,

“What do you need to know to vote on this option?” Sometimes it’s how

you invite questions that results in quality responses.
