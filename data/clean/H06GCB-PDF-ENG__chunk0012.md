# Ensure participation.

Let people know it will be important to hear from everyone on key

topics. If they agree with someone else, they can say, “plus one” rather

than echoing the idea. If they really don’t have anything to contribute,

they can say, “pass.” By requiring a pass or plus one, we raise the bar for

participation and insert everyone’s voice into the room.
