# Planning

- Understanding behavior.

Five categories of behavior have been established for all DUHS

employees (including senior administrators and new employees): customer focus, teamwork, creative problem solving, continuous learning, and diversity. Those supervising other employees are expected to demonstrate two additional behaviors: strategic communication and perform- ance management.

- Defining job results. The supervisor and individ- ual establish expected job results as part of the planning stage. These expected job results are based on the goals of the department and the individualâ€™s job description.
