Saari, ). BOS also provide high levels of feedback and are better than simple rating scales at motivating employees to change their behavior (Tziner, Kopelman, & Livnech, ).

The development of a BOS is relatively straightforward. The first few steps are the same as with a BARS: Critical incidents and behaviors are obtained from employees, the incidents are placed into categories, and each incident is rated as to the level of job performance it represents.

As shown in Table ., the behaviors are then listed. Supervisors read each behavior on the list and use the following scale to find the frequency for an employee performing that specific behavior:

 = Employee engaged in behavior less than % of the time  = Employee engaged in behavior –% of the time  = Employee engaged in behavior –% of the time  = Employee engaged in behavior –% of the time  = Employee engaged in behavior –% of the time

After each employee has been rated on each behavior, the scores from each item in each dimension are summed to give the dimension score. Dimension scores are then summed to yield an overall score. The greatest advantage to BOS is that a supervisor can show employees the specific behaviors that they currently do correctly and the specific behaviors that they should do to receive higher performance evaluations.

Because supervisors conduct evaluations only once every  months, BOS have been criticized for actually measuring only the recall of behaviors rather than measuring the actual observation of behaviors (Murphy et al., ). The importance of this distinction between recall and actual observation comes from research that has demonstrated that after some period of time, we cannot recall specific behaviors; instead, we “recall” behaviors that are consistent with sets of traits or prototypes we attribute to employees (Feldman, ). That is, we assign certain traits or prototypes to employees;  months later, we recall behaviors that are consistent with those traits or prototypes. Furthermore, the closer an employee’s behavior is to the prototype, the more accurate the performance evaluations (Mount & Thompson, ). Thus, as objective and behavioral as BOS appear, they may not be as accurate as initially believed because of cognitive processing distortions.
