conceptualization of work engagement is most applicable to learning contexts. Salanova et al. (2005) might be a useful starting point for the development of a measure of learning engagement. There are a variety of constructs that capture proactive learning behaviors, which are key for human capital resource development in today’s business environment. These include human capital, social capital, informal learning, continuous learning, workplace learning, deliberate practice, and self-development (Ericsson et al. 1993, London & Smither 1999, Orvis & Leffler 2011).Someoftheseconstructsarebroad(humancapital,socialcapital),andothersareuniqueyet likely overlap (informal learning and self-development). For example, does informal learning include voluntary participation in formal training activities as well as face-to-face or online in- teraction with others, learning through reflection or experimentation, and learning through reading or seeking knowledge and information online (Dabbagh & Kitsantas 2012, Monaghan 2011)? The constructs have also been operationalized at different levels of analysis (informal learning, human capital, social capital). Additional research needs to help us understand the uniqueness, similarities, and nomological network of these constructs across the micro, team, and macro levels. Also, it will be important to determine if these constructs adequately capture the full range of employees’ proactive learning behaviors or additional constructs are necessary.

Second, it is unlikely that a one-size-fits-all approach to human capital resource development will be effective across cultures. Research with an international focus has contributed to our understanding of training, development, and learning in non-US samples, as well as the prepa- ration of expatriates for successful cross-cultural assignments. However, more studies in- vestigatinglearningfromacomparativeperspectiveareneededtoprovideinsightintohowtoday’s organizations, competing in the global marketplace, can design effective training practices and facilitate learning and transfer of training. For example, research is needed to address whether ideas such as knowledge sharing and informal learning are similar across cultures (etic) or are culturally specific (emic) (Conlon 2004). Also, research needs to examine the extent to which differences in power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation across cultures influence the adoption or effectiveness of different types of instructor characteristics, learning design, and learning climates (Gelfand et al. 2007).

Third, there is a need to conduct more multilevel research and develop multilevel theory. Mathieu & Tesluk (2010) provide an excellent primer on the role of training and development from micro-, macro-, and cross-level perspectives. They argue that mesolevel research is necessary but challenging because learning systems and their components likely combine and interact in many differ ways across situations. They are not easily measured with indexes that sum the presence or absence of systems or their components. For example, understanding an organi- zation’s human capital and how it develops requires more than an assessment of employees’ learning behaviors. Yet, mesolevel research on learning practices likely has a high payoff for researchandpractice.Casestudiesandqualitativeresearchshouldprovideinitialinsightsintohow learning practices influence organizations from a top-down or bottom-up perspective. This will also help us understand how an organization’s human capital resources are developed through compilation processes involving a combination of learning practices and other HRM practices (Kozlowski & Klein 2000). A good example of the type of theory work needed is the multilevel theory developed by Chadwick & Raver (2013), which helps us understand how individuals’ goal orientations influence the way that they individually and collectively engage in organizational learning.

Our understanding of several areas of learning, especially informal learning and transfer of training, has been limited by the use of cross-sectional designs and self-report measures of ante- cedent and outcome variables (e.g., see Blume et al. 2010). We encourage researchers to use de- signs that minimize common method variance and recognize that learning and human capital
