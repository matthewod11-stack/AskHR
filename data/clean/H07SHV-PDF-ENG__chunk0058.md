# than happy.”

Boom, man. It was like a knife to my heart, Adi. All these years when I was running a company and the 14th hour at the oﬃce before the ﬁrst

hour with my kids, well, news ﬂash man, they grew up. They grew up

and I missed a lot of it. And I really, really regret that. Now I’m not going

to miss it with my grandkids, I get a do-over. I’m not going to screw that

up twice. That’s a really important thing.

If I could have had a little bit more perspective, I would not have been

less successful. The data don’t lie on this either. The 14th hour is not

productive. It’s just compulsive. Just like any other addiction, the 14th

drink doesn’t give you more joy. Stop at two, is the bottom line, because

you need the balance in this part of your life as well.
