(2007) found that organisations deployed high investment HR systems more for core

Similarly, Battâ€™s (2000) research in call centres called for differentiation in HR practices

contingency approach and argue that the key is to deploy HR practices that are

appropriate to the context of the organisation. Notwithstanding this, we do recognise that

for such employees a commitment-orientated HR system seems appropriate (Lepak and

Snell, 2002). The emphasis for HR practices should be on building the motivation,
