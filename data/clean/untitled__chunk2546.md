# EDUCATION AND TRAINING

In the early 1980s, the ﬁrst systematic attempts were made to identify education and training opportunities in the broad area of health psychology. Belar identiﬁed 42 doctoral programs and 43 postdoctoral programs offering one or more elements of such education (Belar & Siegel, 1983; Belar, Wilson, & Hughes, 1982). Gentry, Street, Masur, and Asken (1981) identiﬁed 48 internship programs. Within doctoral programs of that era, the predominant model (70%) was that of a health psychology track within another area of psychology (usually clinical, counseling, or school psychology).

In 1983, the ﬁrst national conference speciﬁcally devoted to graduate education and training was held at Arden House, New York. Chaired by Stephen M. Weiss, the conference de- veloped recommendations for doctoral, internship, and post- doctoral curricula and training experiences for those pursuing careers in either research or the practice of health psychology (Stone, 1983). Core curricular graduate-level components included biological, social, and psychological bases of health systems and behavior as well as health research training, ethics, interdisciplinary collaboration, and access to health care settings under the mentorship of experienced psychol- ogy faculty. A deﬁning text oriented to education and training requirements also resulted from this conference: Health Psychology: A Discipline and a Profession (Stone et al., 1987).
