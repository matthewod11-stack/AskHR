# nature of leadership styles.

Take for example, servant leadership which is typically conceptualised as a multi-

dimensional construct. The most common measure of servant leadership (Liden et al., 2008

scale) includes seven dimensions: emotional healing, creating value for the community,

conceptual skills, empowering, helping subordinates, grow and succeed, putting subordinates

first, behaving ethically. As servant leadership is multi-faceted, the link with the two bases of

trust is likely to be through different dimensions. One could argue servant leaders create trust

by acting with integrity and ethics (thus suggestive of an important link to cognitive trust).

However, the care and concern implied by other aspects of the style (such as the

empowerment component) may be germane for building affective trust. Such a discussion

portrays the complexities of trying to tease out the differential nature of the relationship for a

given leadership style with the bases of trust. In Appendix C (online), we offer a table that

indicates the strength of the theoretical link between the dimensions of a given style with

cognitive and affective trust as well as LMX quality. Any efforts to further test these links

should go hand in hand with improved study design that can reduce endogeneity biases and
