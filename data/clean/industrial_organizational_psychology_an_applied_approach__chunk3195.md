# Take the Initiative S

Instead of waiting for instructions and for people to tell you what to do, chart your own course. Show initiative, try to solve problems, make suggestions. Don’t be afraid to take risks, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes. As hockey star Wayne Gretzky once said, “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”
