# 74 Comparative Psychology

Atradition of edited textbooks in the ﬁeld began with F. A. Moss’s (1934) Comparative Psychology. The 15 chapters included information on maturation, motivation, sensory function, learning, individual differences, animal social psy- chology, and a set of related topics. This work was followed by similar volumes from various editors at regular intervals in 1942, 1951, 1960, and 1973.

An interesting approach was taken by Normal L. Munn (1933) with his An Introduction to Animal Psychology. The book is concerned solely with the behavior of laboratory rats and provides a comprehensive review of many characteristics of rats.
