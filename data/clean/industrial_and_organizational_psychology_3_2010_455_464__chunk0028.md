normative and descriptive theories can and should be employed in IOOB research.

Finally, Rosen et al. (2010) make a strong case for the utility of naturalistic deci- sion making (NDM) vis-`a-vis understand- ing organizational processes as studied by IOOB, especially in terms of improving decision-making performance. We agree, though we are also in agreement with their comment to the effect that NDM needs to improve the overly context-speciÔ¨Åc nature of its models and tests thereof. To be clear, we do believe that NDM, despite being a very young discipline, is likely to be of inter- est to IOOB researchers and practitioners. We also agree that JDM has been overly focused on the choice component of the decision process and that NDM has a role in other components of the process, such as problem detection and situation awareness.
