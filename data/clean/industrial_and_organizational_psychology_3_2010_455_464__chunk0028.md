## Areas Where IOOB Has the Potential to Enrich JDM

In our focal article, we concentrated primarily on what IOOB had to gain by incorporating JDM theories. However, we indicated that cross-fertilization could just as easily ﬂow in the opposite direction, from IOOB to JDM, and we provided some examples in this regard. The commentators provide many additional examples.

Of relevance to the previous discussion of external validity, several commentators (Bottom & Kong, 2010; Goodwin, 2010; Kuhn, 2010; see also Staw, 2010) argue that organizations are complex and that decision making in organizations involves multiple—and often incompatible—goals, of which decision accuracy is only one. Pol- itics, impression management, uncertainty, social cohesion, and so forth are also impor- tant considerations for managers, but these considerations, the authors argue, are not typically studied in JDM research. It is in this context that Goodwin argues that although research on managerial forecasting has thus far been dominated by the JDM approach, the IOOB approach has much to offer.

These are good points. We did not mean to imply that accuracy is the only
