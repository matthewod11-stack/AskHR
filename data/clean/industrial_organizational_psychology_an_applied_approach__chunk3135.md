Make sure you understand what your role is in the office or the team. This is where a good job description helps! One of the fastest ways to get a bad reputation as a colleague or team member is when others “perceive” that you are stepping into their territory. Again, if you aren’t sure what tasks you should be performing, ask someone before you do them, to avoid stepping on toes.
