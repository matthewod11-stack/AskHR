# 10.4 SELECTING A CONTINGENT PAY PLAN

Assuming an organization wishes to implement a CP plan, what should the plan look like? Recall the discussion of various forms of compensation provided in Chapter 1. What considerations should be taken into account in choosing, for example, among offering employees group incentives, profit sharing, or individual sales commissions? A critical issue to consider is that of organizational culture. An organizationâ€™s culture is defined by its unwritten rules and procedures. For example, is the organization funda- mentally built around individual performance, or is teamwork the norm?

Consider the types of systems that can be implemented in cultures that we can label traditional or involvement cultures.

What type of plan should be implemented in organizations with this type of culture? An effective choice would be a plan that rewards specific and observable measures of performance, where that performance is clearly defined and directly linked to pay. Examples of such CP systems are the following:

Employees are paid based on the number of units produced or repaired. This system is usually implemented in manufacturing environments. In service organizations, this could involve the number of calls made or the number of clients, or potential clients, contacted. This system is usually implemented in call centers.

- Sales commissions.

Employees are paid based on a percentage of sales. This

system is usually implemented in car dealerships.

- Group incentives.

Employees are paid based on extra group production based on result-oriented measures (e.g., sales volume for the group). This system is implemented frequently in the retail industry.

Involvement culture is different from traditional culture. Organizations with involvement cultures are characterized by shared decision making, lateral communications, and loosely
