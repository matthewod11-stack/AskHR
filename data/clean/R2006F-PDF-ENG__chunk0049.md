To get some agreement on quality standards, the engineering teams

invited senior design and marketing leaders to meet, ﬁguring that

they would oﬀer a new perspective. The design leaders brought an

additional artistic sensibility to the debate, asking, “What makes a

beautiful portrait?” To help reassess the zero-artifacts standard, they

collected images from great portrait photographers. They noted, among

other things, that these photos often had blurring at the edges of a face

but sharpness on the eyes. So they charged the algorithm teams with

achieving the same eﬀect. When the teams succeeded, they knew they

had an acceptable standard.

Another issue that emerged was the ability to preview a portrait photo

with a blurred background. The camera team had designed the feature

so that users could see its eﬀect on their photos only after they had been

taken, but the human interface (HI) design team pushed back, insisting

that users should be able to see a “live preview” and get some guidance

about how to make adjustments before taking the photo. Johnnie

Manzari, a member of the HI team, gave the camera team a demo.

“When we saw the demo, we realized that this is what we needed to do,”

Townsend told us. The members of his camera hardware team weren’t sure they could do it, but diﬃculty was not an acceptable excuse for

failing to deliver what would clearly be a superior user experience. After
