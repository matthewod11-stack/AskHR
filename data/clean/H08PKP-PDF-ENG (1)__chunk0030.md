## HBR / Digital Article / When You’re Asked to Meet Impossible Goals

Saying yes to everything doesn’t strengthen your leadership—it

overloads it. Being able to say no when needed is what separates strong

leaders from struggling ones. Leaders who push back strategically aren’t

seen as diﬃcult but as credible decision-makers, trusted advisors, and

the ones who drive sustainable results. They don’t just work hard; they

prioritize relentlessly.
