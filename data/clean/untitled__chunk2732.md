## CLIENT RESISTANCE AND TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS

There were signiﬁcantly fewer reported sources of resistance in 1992 than in 1986, (i.e., 39% versus 61%, respectively; n (cid:2) 159). For example, attendance was one of the categories reported less frequently in 1986. Client dropout rates and length of treatment have been commonly reported problems by both white and non-white therapists working with ethnic minority clients (Sue, Zane, & Young, 1994). Based on our results, it appears that therapists in 1992 were better prepared to deal with resistance than those responding in 1986.

Training signiﬁcantly contributed to the work of therapists in 1992. Half of those surveyed (n (cid:2) 87) indicated that they had received training that was helpful in understanding the therapeutic needs of ethnic minorities.
