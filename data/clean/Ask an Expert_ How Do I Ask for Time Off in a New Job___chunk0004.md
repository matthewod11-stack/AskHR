little anxious about the etiquette of it all. As a newbie, I didn’t wantto come across as “too bold” and take time off “too soon,” so I waitedat least a year before dipping my toe into the PTO pool. On the otherhand, I’ve observed new employees take PTO immediately afterjoining the organization.I guess I’m stuck in this way of thinking you need to earn credibilityto deserve taking PTO. As I write this, that sounds toxic. Pleaseteach me about workplace PTO decorum, particularly whenstarting out at a new job.With gratitude,Scratching My HeadWe reached out to

Mita Mallick, the head of inclusion, equity, andimpact at Carta, to answer the question.Dear SMH,Your concern is a valid one! When we start a new job, we are alleager to make a great first impression. We want our boss and ournew team members to know they hired the right talent for therole. So, when (and how) to take personal time off or PTO canweigh on our minds. We might think that not taking a vacation isa sign of dedication and loyalty to our jobs. You may also worrythat others will perceive you as undetermined, lazy, or easilyreplaceable.
