Lee Axelrad provided invaluable assistance in the data collection phase of this research. Additionally, I gratefully acknowledge the helpful comments of the following people on earlier drafts of this manuscript: Lee Axelrad, Catherine Albiston, Lori Johnson, Robert Nelson, Judy Nielsen, the researchers on the Comparative Legal Systems Project, and the anonymous reviewers from Law & Policy. I also owe a debt of gratitude to Robert Kagan, who provided me the opportunity to work on the project and guidance at every phase of the research process. Special thanks to the corporate officials and lawyers at PCO who remain anonymous. Without their generosity and honesty this project would have been impossible.
