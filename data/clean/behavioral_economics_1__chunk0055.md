# E. Neuroeconomics

Neuroeconomics is the grounding of microeconomics in details of neural functioning. It is natural to be

skeptical about whether economists need to know precisely where in the brain computations occur to make

predictions about economic behavior such as responses to prices. But keep in mind that the revealed preferences

approach which deliberately avoided “trying to discover the essence of things” (in Pareto’s phrase) was adopted

about a hundred years ago. At that time it really was impossible to make all the measurements and causal

interventions that can be made today, with PET, TMS, MEG, pharmacological and hormone changes, genetic

testing in all species and gene knockouts in mice (actually engineering the genes), and fMRI. The fact that there

are so many tools means that limits of one method can be compensated for by strengths of other methods (they

are complements). Technological substitution from 100 years ago to now suggest economists might learn
