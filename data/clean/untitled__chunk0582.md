# 86 Sensation and Perception

modality-speciﬁc issue might be the chain of events that leads from the absorption of a photon to a visual neural re- sponse and a conscious recognition of the stimulus. Instead, this is to suggest that there are global theoretical and method- ological frameworks that encompass all sensory and percep- tual research. To refer back to that very speciﬁc issue of visual detection, while the mechanism of how a photon is captured is speciﬁc to sight, all sensory modalities must deal with the ideas of detection and of sensory thresholds and their relationship to what the individual consciously perceives. It is also likely that the higher-level decisional processes, where the observer must decide if a stimulus is there or not, will be the same whether one is dealing with vision, audition, olfac- tion, or any other sensory system. Thus, we ﬁnd that certain common issues and deﬁnitions cut across all sensory modali- ties. These methods, philosophical foundations, and psycho- logical understandings have undergone a steady evolution during the history of this area of psychology.

This chapter will be written as an overview and will con- centrate on some general themes rather than upon the data and ﬁndings from any one sensory modality. From this, hope- fully, some idea of the context and scope of the study of per- ception and its relationship to other aspects of psychology and other sciences will emerge. Three global issues will reap- pear many times and in several guises during this history. The ﬁrst deals with the perceptual problem, which is really the issue of the correspondence (or noncorrespondence) between our internal representation of the environment in conscious- ness and the objectively measured external physical situa- tion. The second has to do with the borrowing of methods, viewpoints, and theoretical formulations from other sciences, such as physics and physiology. The third is the distinction between sensation and perception, which is really the distinc- tion between stimulus-determined aspects of consciousness and interpretive or information-processing contributions to the conscious perceptual experience.
