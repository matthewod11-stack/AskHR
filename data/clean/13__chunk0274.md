As we discussed earlier, the growing implementation of virtual teams and reliance on electronic technology for communicating across distances can be another important factor inﬂuencing the relationship between team diversity and outcomes. Researchers have argued that, in dispersed settings that may be characterized as a depersonalized context, surface level diversity can have less signiﬁcant consequences. It is possible that in these settings, aspects of diversity that are more closely tied to nature of communication both spoken and written may play a more signiﬁcant role and other aspects of diversity may be less salient. Even in co-located settings, team members may rely on electronic communications for day-to-day communications (Kirkman & Mathieu, 2005). Therefore, physical dispersion as well as level of reliance on technology enabled communications may be important contextual considerations that can potentially mitigate the effects of diversity on outcomes. Since an overwhelming number of diversity effects that we uncovered in our literature search were non-signiﬁcant, we suggest that the contextual considerations described above merit closer scrutiny in future research.
