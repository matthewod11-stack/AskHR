# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

emerging leadership styles have also found support for a strong link with trust in leadership

(see Table 1). When compared to the full-range model, it may be the case that some of these

more recent additions to the leadership literature may be stronger determinants of trust. More

contemporary styles, such as ethical and servant leadership, emerged as a direct attempt to

address a lack of trust and faith in organisational leaders (Avolio & Walumbwa, 2014). As

such, the moral tone of these styles may be more suited to facilitating trust compared to

transformational leadership, which does not explicitly address ethics as a core tenet (Brown et

al., 2005). There is some support for this contention (e.g., Hoch et al., 2018). For example,

some of the core qualities associated with these more morally toned styles, such as

transparency and openness (Korsgaard et al., 2002; Norman et al., 2010), play a central role

in facilitating integrity (Mayer et al., 1995) or cognitive forms of trust.

Theories of leadership such as authentic, servant and ethical leadership (Dinh et al.,

- 2014) can be grouped together in a ‘moral approaches’ category (Lemoine et al., 2019).

Within this category, scholars typically draw on common theoretical arguments including

SET to explain how these styles facilitate trust. For example, integrity is a core feature of
