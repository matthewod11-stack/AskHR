To make skill development easy, schedule a quarterly skill-check

meeting with each of your direct reports. During a one-hour

conversation, help your direct report reﬂect on their current skill goals

and, if they don’t yet have any or have hit them all, pick a new one.

Doing so will shift the culture changes from one where “squeaky

wheels” and underperformers get feedback, and instead, leaders have

forward-looking conversations to build up their high performers like

Élodie. High performers will take skill-based advice and run with it,

allowing them to grow in place, instead of jumping to a new job. Loyalty
