Test length, item homogeneity, and scorer accuracy can affect the reliability of a test. There are three ways to measure reliability: (a) the test-retest method, which measures temporal stability; (b) the alternate-forms method, which measures forms stability; and (c) the internal consistency method (split-half, K-R , and coefficient alpha), which measures item homogeneity. Tests can be validated using five approaches: content, criterion, construct, known-group, and face. Information about tests can be obtained from such sources as the Measurements Yearbook. The utility of a test can be determined using the Taylor-Russell tables, the Lawshe tables, proportion of correct decisions, and utility formulas. The fairness of a test can be determined by testing for adverse impact, single-group validity, and differential validity. Selection decisions can be made in four ways: top-down, rule of three, top-down with banding, or passing scores.
