In your head, it might be easier to postpone giving hard feedbackuntil a performance review, or until your employee is put on aperformance improvement plan (PIP). But waiting to givefeedback only means it will take your employee longer to improve— they can’t make changes if they’re unaware of what they’redoing wrong.
