# Performance Appraisal

one will be more or less appropriate depending on the purpose of the assess- ment. For example, a results approach might be more suitable as a basis for awarding a bonus. A beha% ior emphasis would be better when assessments are to be used to determine a manager's training needs. A person or trait orienta- tion makes sense when the assessment is to be used as input to making a pro- In the last case, we need to predict a person's likely future motion decision. success, and knowing his or her personal traits or qualities helps us to do this.1')

The message of this section is that the format and content of the assessment device to be implemented should certainly not be determined arbmanly if rater errors in obser- vation and appraisal are to be avoided. Administrators should consider carefully the organizational context, the prevailing managerial philosophy, ind the purpose for carrying out the appraisal program before any decisions about format or content are made.

Douglas McGregor argues that supervisors are very reluctant to "play God" in appraising employees' performance, and implies that they may intentionally distort ratings as a result of this reluctanee.2n Some of the reasons for managers' resistance to performance appraisal cited by McGregor include. ( I ) a normal dislike of criticizing a subordinate (and perhaps having to argue about it), (2) lack of interview= skills, (3) dislike of new procedures v,ith accompanying changes in ways of operating, and (4) mistrust of the validity of the appraisal instrument.21

Carl Kujaw ski and Drew Young suggest, "Too often this resistance is justified. If an appraisal program is developed independently by a staff unit and imposed from above, it has a good chance for failure. Flowever,, it doesn't hive to be this way. "22

Kujaw ski and Young point out Peter Drueker's major suggestion for overcoming resistance to change. "Workers must be pros ided with opportunities for participation that will give them a managenal v iew."21 They then translate Dnicker's des ice into a pragmatic suggestion for administrators who sire trying to implement a workable appraisal progi am:

Ore approach is to have the personnel department work with a cross section of management in developing the appraisal program. Once the outline of the program has been established, it can be circulated to a larger group of managers for review and comment, and the program modified as needed.

Depending on the particular needs of the organization and the results desired, the number of levels of management involved in the design of the program will vary. The critical faetoi is that the users of the program be involved. By being so, they' will come to "own" the program, tnd therefore will be more willing to support it because it is theirs.24
