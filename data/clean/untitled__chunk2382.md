# Overview

The Thoroughbred Years brought to fruition the symbols of professionalization emerging in the Hybrid Years and several symbols not attained until after 1970. It was an era of estab- lishing an identity for the ﬁeld despite conﬂicting points of tension along dimensions of doctoral and nondoctoral practice, credentialing, and training. The ﬁeld has survived its divided organizational viewpoints and has continued to thrive. Among doctoral psychology specialties, it has gained a position of parity sought for many decades. Among non- doctoral psychology groups, it is without peer for recognition and stability. Nondoctoral school psychology may even have

established the model for how other nondoctoral psychology groups (e.g., mental health workers) could better manage their conﬂicts over training and credentialing.

As school psychology matured, tensions developed along other dimensions related to practice. These included the use of traditional normatively referenced tests versus the use of nontraditional, criterion-referenced methods such as curriculum-based assessment; viewing practice as primarily related to issues of school instruction and learning versus a school mental health orientation; viewing one’s training orientation as primarily based in education versus in psychol- ogy; practicing as a specialist versus as a generalist; empha- sizing traditional psychoeducational assessment roles versus consultation and intervention roles. These lines of tension have not seriously threatened the vitality of school psychol- ogy. Rather, they have signaled the diversity of the ﬁeld and its resilience against adopting a single model for its future. The diversity is observed in the ﬁeld’s organizational struc- tures, literature, practice settings, training programs, and sub- specialty development. The ﬁeld has established an identity that was only emerging in the late Hybrid Years and is now poised to solidify its position among the specialties of psy- chology and school-based pupil personnel services in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
