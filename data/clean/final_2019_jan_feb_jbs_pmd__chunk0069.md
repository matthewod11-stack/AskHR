variable will lead to problem of multi -collinearity in the estimation, still we considered these variables because of the statistical nature of panel data estimation which take care of the collinearity problems. So, we have chosen Panel data analysis, and in panel data analysis we have used Random Affect method of Estimation because fixed effect model is rejected in the analysis based on Hausman specification test. Further, highest value of Hausman test rejects the validity of fixed effect test. The estimates through panel data analysis through Random Affect Method are show in Table 4.
