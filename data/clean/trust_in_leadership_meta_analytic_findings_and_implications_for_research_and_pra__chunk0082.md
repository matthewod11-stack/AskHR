# Theoretical Framework

In initiating this study, we struggled with an expansive literature base that appeared to use an array of perspectives on trust and theories for how it is related to other constructs. In this article, we have offered a theoretical framework to help provide parsimony and to distinguish between two basic perspectives (relationship- and character-based). We hope that the framework serves as a guide for scholars attempting to interpret past research on trust in leadership or to use the concept in future studies.

ments made by scholars and practitioners who have suggested that trust is related to important workplace behaviors and attitudes. As noted earlier, opinions and findings on this issue have differed.

In considering the magnitude of relationships of trust with work outcomes, it is useful to gauge them against other frequently studied attitudinal and perceptual variables in organizational re- search, such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment, occu- pational commitment, job involvement, and procedural and dis- tributive justice. Earlier meta-analyses of these literatures make this comparison possible (Brown, 1996; Colquitt et al., 2001; Iaffaldano & Muchinsky, 1985; Lee, Carswell, & Allen, 2000; Mathieu & Zajac, 1990; Organ & Ryan, 1995). The relationships of trust with work outcomes tend to be of equivalent size, and in many cases slightly larger than, correlations reported in those meta-analyses. As one example, the uncorrected correlation be- tween trust in direct leader and OCB altruism is .22, which is comparable to the estimates reported in prior meta-analyses for the relationships between OCB altruism and job satisfaction (.23), commitment (.20), and procedural justice (.19). We note that trust in leadership is also related to other important variables, such as belief in information and decision commitment, that tend not to be examined in the other literatures. This set of findings is suggestive of two points. First, assuming that the magnitude of the relation- ships with workplace outcomes is a criterion for judging the practical importance of a construct, trust should be considered as important as other established attitudinal and perceptual variables in the literature. Second, the findings suggest that the appropriate interpretation for the importance of trust in leadership in organi- zational settings lies somewhere between the perspectives that have advocated its great significance (e.g., Golembiewski & Mc- Conkie, 1975) and its insignificance (Williamson, 1993).

If these two perspectives are to be more useful, additional research is needed to clarify the distinctions between them and when each is more applicable. Most individual studies have im- plicitly tended to recognize and use only one of the two per- spectives. Furthermore, research on trust in leadership as a whole has treated the two perspectives as functional equivalents; relationship- and character-based trust theories recognize the same set of determinants of trust and predict the same set of conse- quences. Although the theories have processes that may operate simultaneously and may affect each other, they are conceptually independent. For example, a follower may perceive that (a) the leader has good character, yet the follower does not have a high- quality relationship with the leader; (b) the follower has a high- quality relationship with the leader yet questions the leaders’ overall character (e.g., because of observations of how the leader treats other followers); (c) the leader has questionable character, and the follower does not have a high-quality relationship with the leader; or (d) the leader has good character, and the follower has a high-quality relationship with the leader. In subsequent para- graphs, we provide suggestions for better understanding the two perspectives and the distinctions between them by investigating the mediating processes by which the theories operate and mod- erating conditions under which they are most applicable.

The data also provide some insight into the relative magnitude of the relationships between trust and different constructs. As predicted, trust in leadership was most strongly related to work attitudes, followed by most of the citizenship behaviors, and fi- nally job performance.3 This set of findings is particularly note- worthy because trust theorists most often focus on behavioral and performance consequences of trust, and many practitioners may be most interested in the direct “bottom line” benefits of trust. Schol- ars and practitioners should be aware that although trust may affect performance, it may have a marginally greater impact on OCBs and a substantially greater impact on people’s evaluations and attitudes regarding the workplace.

Given that our analysis demonstrates evidence of significant relationships between trust and hypothesized outcomes, we sug- gest two important directions for advancing knowledge. First, future research should empirically examine the mediating pro- cesses involved. Doing so is important for at least two reasons: It will help distinguish between the effects of the relationship-based and character-based theories, and it will help establish causality. At present, there appears to be minimal research that empirically examines the specific processes by which the relationship-based or
