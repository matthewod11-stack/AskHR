# 11.4.3 Performance Execution

The third component of the performance management process involves perform- ance execution. Autonomous teams are solely responsible for performance execu- tion; however, when a team has a supervisor, then both the team and the supervisor share responsibilities for performance execution. For example, team members need to be committed to goal achievement and should take a proactive role in seeking feedback from one another as well as from the supervisor (if there is one). The burden is on the team to communicate openly and regularly with its supervisor. Also, team members are responsible for being prepared for the performance review by conducting regular and realistic peer appraisals. In this way, team members have solid information regarding their performance as perceived by other team members before they meet the supervisor. The supervisor also has important responsibilities including observing and documenting team performance and the relative contri- bution of the team members, updating the team on any changes in the goals of the organization, and providing resources and reinforcement so that team members will be motivated to succeed.
