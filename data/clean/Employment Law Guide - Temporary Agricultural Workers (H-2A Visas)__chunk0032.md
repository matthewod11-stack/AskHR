Employers certiﬁed under H-2A must keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers' earnings as well as the hours each

worker actually works. In addition the employer must retain a record of time "oﬀered" to the worker but which the worker "refused" to work.

Records must also include the time the worker began and ended each day, the rate of pay, the earnings per pay period, the worker's home address, and the amount of and reasons for any and all deductions taken from the worker's wages. These records must be kept for three years

after the date of the H-2A certiﬁcation.
