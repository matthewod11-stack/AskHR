## HBR / Digital Article / The Insidious Effects of Hurrying

Prioritize grace over accomplishment.

One of my executive coaching clients is a self-described dopamine

addict who relishes the feeling of her brain’s reward system getting

a high-ﬁve as she checks things oﬀ her to-do list. When she doesn’t

accomplish goals as rapidly as she would like, she feels frustrated and

irritable and is hard on herself for not meeting her own expectations.

Fortunately, she’s ﬁnding relief from the self-induced stress by learning

to extend grace to herself, a powerful form of self-compassion that

allows us to direct our energy in a healthier, more productive way. In

her case, she lets herself oﬀ the hook by making an inventory of all the

things she did get done, and counteracts negative self-talk by running it

through the “friend test”: Is this anything she would say to a friend? If

not, she lets it go and moves on.
