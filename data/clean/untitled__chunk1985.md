# CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE TRENDS

It should be apparent that clinical psychology has come a long way since 1896. Its growth was slow during the early years of its development when it essentially focused on psychomet- rics, research, and pedagogical services to children.Although this was made clear in the chapter by Parke and Clarke- Stewart in this volume, we should at least mention that the major contribution of clinical psychologists at that time was in the measurement of intelligence. The age scale of Binet- Simon led to the revisions of Lewis Terman (the Stanford- Binet), longitudinal studies of gifted children (Terman, 1925) that are still being pursued, infant and adult scales that have contributed to our understanding of intellectual functioning throughout the life span, and fairly reliable and valid predic- tors of success in school, work, and psychotherapy.

Following World War II, clinical psychology grew rapidly until it became a dominant force in American psychology and an established and legally recognized profession with a re- spected place among the mental health disciplines. Its major contribution in the postwar period has been in treatment for- mulations, especially behavior therapy approaches.

Clinical psychology is now perhaps the most popular ﬁeld of psychological specialization in the world (Sexton & Hogan, 1992). With increasing numbers of clinicians has come a trend toward more and more areas of specialization (e.g., school psychology, health psychology, clinical child psychology, pediatric psychology, clinical geropsychology, clinical neuropsychology, family psychology, psychological hypnosis, rehabilitation psychology), many of which have developed into ﬁelds of their own (Fagan, 1996; Wallston, 1997). In addition, the practices within the ﬁeld have ex- panded, with more sophisticated evaluation techniques (see the chapter by Weiner in this volume), various therapeutic ap- proaches (including use of the electronic medias), and the possibility of prescribing psychotropic medications (see the chapter by Benjamin, DeLeon, Freedheim, & VandenBos in this volume).

Such growth in numbers and differentiation is to be ex- pected. Nevertheless, care should be exercised to ensure that psychologists are aware of their commonalties—their origins

from a common history and their beliefs in a common set of values. That awareness, we hope, has been enhanced by the reading of this volume.
