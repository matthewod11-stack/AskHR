cultures in generating a shared mental model of TP. Because PC is a measure of the director’s experience and expertise, the ability to share this information effectively will lead to a higher level of belief that the team can accomplish their objectives. It is through their ability to achieve high levels of interaction and appro- priately share their experience and expertise that their collective belief in their ability to achieve goals can be manifested in TP. We therefore hypothesize the following relation- ships between board characteristics, TIQ and TP:

Hypothesis 4a: Team interaction quality (TIQ) mediates the relationship between cultural intelligence quotient (CQ) and team potency (TP).

Hypothesis 4b: Team interaction quality (TIQ) mediates the relationship between professional capital (PC) and team potency (TP).

As described above, we would expect a relationship between the knowledge resources the director brings to the board and their ability to perform effectively in a team because of a heightened ability to communicate. When TIQ is high, we would expect to see this resulting in higher levels of TTP. O’Reilly III et al (1998) observed that because boards are charged with complex, interactive tasks, the degree of TIQ – or as they characterize it, ‘interpersonal attrac- tion’ – will have an impact on how well those tasks are performed. Because in a team it is the collective actions of each individual that con- tribute to the ability to achieve task completion, a high level of information exchange, group decision making and shared mental models are required to achieve the TTP goals. It is through the ‘intervening processes’ or dynamics that teams are able to generate outcomes. We there- fore hypothesize that:
