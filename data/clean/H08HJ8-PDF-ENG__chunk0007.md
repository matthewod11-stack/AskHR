# your behavior on those around you.

Reﬂect on what’s really bothering you.

People sometimes erroneously assume that other people (e.g. their

manager) or situations (e.g. the reporting structure) need to change for

them to be productive, engaged, and collaborative. This is a falsehood

that puts you in a victim mindset. You can still do good work whether or

not you’re enamored with your direct manager.
