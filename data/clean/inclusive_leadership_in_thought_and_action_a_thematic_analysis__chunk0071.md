leadership research which speculates that leaders who are available and accessible to employees help to create climates of approachability and psychological safety (Edmondson, 2004), the leaders in our study emphasize behaviors for making time to meet individually with team members and proactively doing so. While reporting such behaviors may be reﬂective of leaders’ aspirational behavior for creating an experience of inclusion, this emergent theme suggests that the actual establishment of environments (e.g., space, time, etc.) in which inclusive behavior can occur is important. Ac- cordingly, research is needed to examine leader agency in terms of availability and accessibility as a behavioral dimension of inclusive leadership.
