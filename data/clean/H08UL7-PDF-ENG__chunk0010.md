## Assess Your Team’s Emotional Intelligence

The ﬁrst step in acquiring these norms is to understand your

team’s current baseline. My colleagues and I have developed a quick

assessment that lets you gauge a group’s Team EI, so you can see what

changes may improve your culture. As the leader of the team, read each

item below, and jot down a score between 1 and 5 for each that reﬂects

how you perceive the team operates in each area:

- 1. Your team is not actively doing this.

- 2. Your team tries but is weak in this area.

- 3. Your team is ok or following this norm sometimes.

- 4. Your team does this most of the time and you feel it does a good job.

- 5. Your team is especially strong in this area.
