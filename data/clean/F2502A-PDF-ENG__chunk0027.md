## innovations and improvements in our products and customer service.

How did you communicate the AI directive to your employees?

A common fear is that AI might take their jobs. Some people don’t even

want to use it. So I emphasize the importance of their career aspirations.

I say I want to help them use the time windfall to further streamline tasks

that hinder their progress. I ask people to imagine how they’d like to do

their jobs three, five, and 10 years from now. What would they automate and

why? Then we try to automate it.

What kind of tasks are your people applying gen AI to?

One of our business analysts proposed a project to improve our support

channels. He developed a system that uses AI to analyze call routing and

ensure that customers are directed to the right support engineer quickly.

It not only improved our efficiency but also demonstrated AI’s potential to

help employees drive innovation. The success of this project has inspired

other employees to explore AI-driven solutions for their work.
