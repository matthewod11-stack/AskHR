## HBR / Digital Article / How to Manage an Employee Who Always Makes Excuses

Let’s consider why an employee might fail. This will provide clues about

where a more robust process could remove excuses. First, they might

have no idea what you’re expecting of them or what doing a good

job requires. That’s an alignment issue. Second, they might lack the

knowledge or skills to accomplish the task — a competence problem.

Finally, they might lack the motivation to get over the line (or out of the

gate). To be successful, an employee needs to understand what to do,

know how to do it, and want to do it.

If an employee repeatedly fails, one or more of those foundational

pillars are missing. Your job is to create a process that acts as a

performance scaﬀold to strengthen their alignment, capability, and

motivation. This process should support the person from the moment

you assign the task until the moment they deliver it. It should also

negate their standard excuses. But of course, exactly which planks you

need in that scaﬀold depends on the person’s speciﬁc shortcomings.
