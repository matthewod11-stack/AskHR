Many Managers dislike the disciplinary portion of their job more than anything else. In fact in studies of International Manpower Management by Abbass J. (1993), Managers rank firing an employee at the top of the list of actions in which they most hate to play part. Managers would rather spend their time on activities such as setting goals, reviewing progress and eliminating problems employees experience as they strive to complete their work.

From a company perspective, an employee reprimand demonstrates that the company will be working with the employee to help him or her improve. At the same time, the company documents its increasing unhappiness with the

The (cid:449)ritte(cid:374) e(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ee reprimand shows that the employee will also be informed of the performance problem and their consequences if they reminded uncorrected. Following the letter of reprimand, depending on

If the supervisor has faith that the employee can improve his or her performance, at any time during the discipline any action proceedings, and preferably before the first letter of reprimand, the supervisor can introduce a performance, improvement plan (PIP). The PIP is a formal, detailed document with goals, expectations and timelines, the

Mullins (2005), opinionates that disciplinary action, such as an employee reprimands, can be a win-win if the employee needs the message. If the employee does not, the company and the their manager have effectively protected interests and the interests of employees who are performing satisfactorily. The goal is to prevent negative impact on performing employees whose morale is affected by the employee who is not doing his or her job. As a communication tool with employees, an employee reprimand must be fair. Employers need to make certain that they are using the tool appropriately and that certain conditions exist for its effective and successful use. Employee job description must
