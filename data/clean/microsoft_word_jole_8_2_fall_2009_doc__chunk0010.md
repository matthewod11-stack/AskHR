# Measures

Leadership Skills. The assessment center was a pre-requisite exercise for enrollment in a required management skills course. The assessment center method, which offers a direct assessment of the behaviors, motivations, and knowledge needed for a target position, involves multiple evaluation techniques, including various types of job-related simulations and psychological tests. The American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) commissioned Development Dimensions International (DDI) in the late 1980s to develop an assessment center as a means of measuring learning outcomes measurement in business schools (AACSB, 1989).

The Assessment Center exercises used in this study are those developed by DDI. They included the following simulations: • • • • •

An in-basket exercise. Group discussions. Simulated performance interview with a “subordinate.” Oral presentation exercise. Written communication exercise.

The validity of using the assessment center method in both industrial and academic settings has been established. The standardized administration and scoring inherent in the assessment center method helps to insure the reliability and validity of the data that are produced (Gaugler, Rosenthal, Thornton, & Bentson (1987)). Riggio, Mayes, and Schleicher (2003) and Waldman and Kobar (2004) established the criterion-related validation for the use of assessment centers in academic settings. They were able to establish significant correlations between assessment center performance and post-graduate supervisory ratings (Riggio, et al., 2003) as well as subsequent job satisfaction, number of promotions, and salary (Waldman and Kobar, 2004).

One advantage of using assessment center methods is that it allows for the measurement of a multidimensional array of skills associated with the leadership construct. Nine independent factors (dimensions) were measured in the current study, including (a) planning, (b) analysis, (c) judgment, (d) delegation, (e) maximizing performance, (f) individual Leadership, (g) teamwork, (h) communication, and (h) written communication. Definitions of each of these skills are listed in Appendix A.
