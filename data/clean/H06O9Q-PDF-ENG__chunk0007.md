People’s motivations for making big career moves — including

changing companies, starting new ventures, and leaving the workforce

altogether — amid the Great Resignation vary. The pandemic showed

some people that remote and ﬂexible work was possible. It prompted

others to reevaluate their priorities, particularly around the balance

between work and the rest of their lives. And for some, the pandemic

came with a large blinking “YOLO” sign that pushed them past fears that

kept them from doing what they had always wanted.
