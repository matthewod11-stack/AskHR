The medial temporal lobe is necessary for establishing one kind of memory, what is termed long-term declarative or ex- plicit memory. Declarative memory refers to the capacity for conscious recollection of facts and events (Squire, 1992). It is specialized for rapid, even one-trial learning, and for forming conjunctions between arbitrarily different stimuli. It is typically assessed in humans by tests of recall, recognition, or cued recall, and it is typically assessed in monkeys by tests of recognition (e.g., the delayed-nonmatching-to-sample task). The medial temporal lobe memory system appears to perform a critical function beginning at the time of learn- ing in order that representations can be established in long- term memory in an enduring and usable form (see also Eichenbaum, Otto, & Cohen, 1994).

Another important discovery that paralleled in time the work on the medial temporal lobe system involved the un- derstanding that there is more than one kind of memory. Speciﬁcally, work with amnesic patients and with experi- mental animals who sustained lesions to speciﬁc brain regions showed that other kinds of abilities (including skills, habit learning, simple forms of conditioning, and the phe- nomenon of priming, which are collectively referred to as nondeclarative memory) lie outside the province of the me- dial temporal lobe memory system. Nondeclarative forms of

memory are intact in amnesic patients and intact in monkeys with medial temporal lobe lesions. For example, classical delay conditioning of skeletal musculature depends on the cerebellum (Thompson & Krupa, 1994), conditioning of emotional responses depends on the amygdala (Davis, 1992; LeDoux, 2000), and habit learning (win-stay, lose-shift re- sponding) depends on the neostriatum (Packard, Hirsh, & White, 1989; Salmon & Butters, 1995). Nondeclarative memory thus refers to a variety of ways in which experience can lead to altered dispositions, preferences, and judgments without providing any conscious memory content.

Further work with monkeys has demonstrated that the severity of memory impairment depends on the locus and extent of damage within the medial temporal lobe memory system. Damage limited to the hippocampal region causes signiﬁcant memory impairment, but damage to the adjacent cortex increases the severity of memory impairment. It is im- portant to note that the discovery that larger medial temporal lobe lesions produce more severe amnesia than smaller le- sions is compatible with the idea that structures within the medial temporal lobe might make qualitatively different con- tributions to memory function. This is because anatomical projections carrying information from different parts of the neocortex enter the medial temporal lobe memory system at different points (Suzuki & Amaral, 1994).

Another important brain area for memory is the dien- cephalon. However, the critical regions in the diencephalon that when damaged produce amnesia have not at the time of writing been identiﬁed with certainty. The important struc- tures appear to include the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the the anterior nucleus, mammillo-thalamic tract, and the mammillary nuclei. Be- cause diencephalic amnesia resembles medial temporal lobe amnesia in many ways, these two regions together probably form an anatomically linked, functional system.

These ﬁndings in monkeys are fully consistent with the ﬁndings from human amnesia. Damage limited to the hip- pocampal region is associated with moderately severe amne- sia (Rempel-Clower, Zola, & Squire, 1996; Zola-Morgan, Squire, Rempel, Clower, & Amarel, 1992), and more exten- sive damage that includes the hippocampal region as well as adjacent cortical regions is associated with more severe memory impairment (Corkin, 1984; Mishkin, 1978; Rempel- Clower et al., 1996; Scoville & Milner, 1957).

The same principle, that more extensive damage produces more severe impairment, has also been established for the hippocampus proper in the case of the rat (E. Moser, Moser, & Andersen, 1993; M. Moser, Moser, & Forrest, 1995). The dorsal hippocampus of the rat is essential for spatial learning in the water maze, and progressively larger lesions of this
