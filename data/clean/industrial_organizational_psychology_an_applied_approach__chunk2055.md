## Are Employees Receiving Feedback on Their Goal Progress?

To increase the effectiveness of goal setting, feedback should be provided to employees on their progress in reaching their goals (Locke & Latham, ; Stajkovic & Luthans, ). Feedback is so important that in a survey of IT (information technology) employees, % said that effective feedback would make them less likely to leave their organization (Joinson, ). Unfortunately, only % of employees report they receive regular feedback on their perfor- mance (Bates, b). Feedback can include verbally telling employees how they are doing, placing a chart on a wall, or using nonverbal communication such as smiles, glares, and pats on the back. Feedback best increases performance when it is positive and informational rather than negative and controlling (Zhou, ).
