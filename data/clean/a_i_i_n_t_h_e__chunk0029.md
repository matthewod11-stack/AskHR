Klarna, a global payments network and shopping platform, introduced a new AI assistant to streamline customer service. Within a few months, the assistant was handling two-thirds of all service chats—doing the work of hundreds of agents and cutting average resolution times fromS 11 minutes to just 2. The initiative is projected to deliver $40 million in pro=t improvement, all while maintaining satisfaction scores on par with human support. These results didn’t happen overnight. Klarna achieved this performance by continuously testing and re=ning the assistantE

Just as importantly, 90% of Klarna’s employees now use AI in their daily work. Growing organization-wide familiarity with AI has enabled Klarna to move faster, launch internal initiatives more e3ciently, and continuously re=ne the customer experience. By investing early and encouraging broad adoption, Klarna is seeing AI’s bene=ts compound—driving returnl across its business.
