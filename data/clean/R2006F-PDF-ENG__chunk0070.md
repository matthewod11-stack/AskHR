## units: the alignment of decision rights with expertise.

Why do companies so often cling to having general managers in

charge of business units? One reason, we believe, is that making the change is diﬃcult. It entails overcoming inertia, reallocating power

among managers, changing an individual-oriented incentive system,

and learning new ways of collaborating. That is daunting when a

company already faces huge external challenges. An intermediate step

may be to cultivate the experts-leading-experts model even within

a business unit structure. For example, when ﬁlling the next senior

management role, pick someone with deep expertise in that area as

opposed to someone who might make the best general manager. But

a full-ﬂedged transformation requires that leaders also transition to a

functional organization. Apple’s track record proves that the rewards

may justify the risks. Its approach can produce extraordinary results.
