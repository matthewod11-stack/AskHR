# Self-Appraisal

Self-appraisals may be justified when the indiidual is in the best position to judge his/her own performance, such as in the Lase of physical isolation or when the individ- ual possesses a unique skill or ability. Self appraisals are useful in development because they emphasize personal grow th, intrinsiL mom anon, and goal-setting. They also communicate to the superior how the subordinate perceives his/her performance and provide insights not otherwise available However, self-appraisals are often poorly correlated with supervisory appraisals and are unreliable as a single source of informa- tion for promotions and merit pay.
