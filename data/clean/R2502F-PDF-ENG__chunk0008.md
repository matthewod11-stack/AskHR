 become experts in each other’s cultural practices.

In any cross-cultural negotiation, it is important for teams to have

ongoing conversations about their shared rituals and behavior. Skipping

or phasing out these conversations usually results in negotiators from

each side defaulting to their preferred ways of operating and increases

## the odds of misunderstanding and miscommunication.

If adapting to another culture’s ritual appeals to you, then go ahead and

enjoy the experience, but beware of the implications and the cognitive

## new rituals for communication and relationship building that will

satisfy, not compromise, most team members’ preferences and avoid

forcing anyone to adapt or be at a disadvantage. For example, when

non-U.S. negotiators meet, they sometimes choose to build from U.S.

rituals (given their prevalence in the global business world) as a neutral

foundation that is somewhat familiar to both sides.

## Leverage Differences in Preferences, Not in Power

As we’ve seen, win-lose negotiators try to leverage power, often using cultural diﬀerences as a way to improve their position or

conceal predatory behavior. But in win-win negotiations, each side

leverages preferences: inclinations toward options, objects, experiences,

# or outcomes.

In the negotiation literature, there is a famous story about two sisters

ﬁghting over the last orange in the house. Their mother takes it, slices

it, and gives each daughter half an orange. Shortly after, the mother sees

the younger sister discard the peel and eat her half, feeling only half

satisﬁed. She later sees the older sister remove the peel on her piece and

discard the fruit, using the peel to bake only half of an orange cake. Had

the mother known about her daughters’ preferences before cutting the

orange, she could have given the younger sister the whole fruit, and the

older sister the whole peel. The younger sister could also have opted to

split her fruit with the older one and help her bake the cake, in exchange

for a slice of the cake once done.

In business negotiations, most people want the same things: to close

successful deals, make money, minimize risks, feel appreciated, and be seen as a good negotiator. The diﬀerences are not so much what

negotiators want but how much each of those things matters relative

to one another. For example, most cross-cultural negotiation experts

point out that people from many Asian countries, which are often

more collectivist in their cultures, signiﬁcantly value saving face in negotiation and are willing to make extra eﬀorts to burnish their

reputations. We know of no culture that dislikes being respected, but

Asian negotiators generally put saving face higher on their preference

# list than people from other cultures.

It’s important to recognize that while intentions and cultural rituals

make negotiations harder as they diverge, the reverse happens with preferences. The more preferences diﬀer among negotiators, the easier

it is for them to make deals that create value for both sides. If I value

money and you value time, you can pay me a premium to expedite the
