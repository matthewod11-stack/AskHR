and perceptions as we go about our day-to-day business. A very strong

culture can foster ethnocentrism—an assumption that one’s own norms

are or should be shared by everyone. This is a recipe for conﬂict.

There are many dimensions along which cultures can vary, such

as tolerance for risk and how to handle conﬂict. Communication

is another obvious one. Israelis, for instance, are generally direct

and straightforward in communicating, whereas Mexicans tend to be

indirect in giving feedback, especially on sensitive issues. Of course,

individuals may hew to their cultures to a greater or lesser extent. Some
