members of disadvantaged groups apply in the ﬁrst place. Blind hiring

policies should also be paired with de-biasing strategies at the interview

stage, since interviews are generally conducted in an unblind fashion.

Indeed, in some of the studies described above, blind hiring boosted

interview selection rates for members of disadvantaged groups but did not ultimately increase their likelihood of getting job oﬀers after

interviews. One especially promising strategy to reduce discrimination

at the interview stage involves the use of structured interviewing, which

keeps interviewers focused on job-related questions only and reduces

the impact of homophily — our natural preference for people who are

By asking themselves these three questions, decision-makers can

determine whether a blind hiring approach to the initial screening process will help or hinder their eﬀorts related to diversity in hiring
