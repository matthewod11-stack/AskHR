Some studies report that 3608 feedback does

not change feedback recipients' behaviour and performance at all. For example, Bernardin et al. (1993) found that managers' ratings from supervisors and customers did not change after the managers received feedback. They also found that store sales volume was unaffected by the use of 3608 feedback, which suggests that 3608 feedback may have no appreciable effect on an organisation-wide basis. If these findings can be generalised, then it is questionable whether or not the investment in 3608 feedback is merited.
