While changes can generate acute reactions in the process of organizational change, employees are also interested in how being open to change can bring them benefits. Change readiness, as opposed to resistance to change, is another concept subject to debate in the literature. Until now, readiness "has been considered a fundamental precursor for the implementation and management of productive changes” (Bateh et al, 2013).

The concept of “change readiness” is reflected in the Lewis model of organizational change, which requires that organizations should first unfreeze the existing mentalities and develop a sense of emergency before actually starting to implement changes. Some employees are more loyal to relationships whereas others are more loyal to the organization’s structural components, which are often based on principles such as efficiency, tradition or creating an acceptable match with counterpart organizations (Chenevert et al, 2019).

Usually, both elements must be approached during the organizational change process. In order to facilitate employee readiness and overcome resistance, some employees need to know that the organization’s staff is being treated fairly during the process, whereas others are more concerned about the logic of the decisions in connection with the structural change.

To facilitate preparedness and overcome resistance, those employees who are more concerned about relationships must be convinced that certain staff changes are necessary and will be made with utmost respect and fairness. The employees concerned about structure may question whether the change is actually necessary and useful or, on the contrary, is a capricious idea of the top managers who want to leave a mark without fully considering the implications. These employees are more likely to adopt a position depending on which change brings about few benefits but many obstacles. They will probably accept the changes if they can be convinced that short-term challenges will ensure long-term benefits. In order to engage them in the change process, “they must be convinced that the long-term benefits will be more rewarding than the inherent short-term disruptions and inefficiencies of the change process” (Bateh et al, 2013, p.114).

- 5. Conclusions

Global economy continues to influence the manner in which companies run their business. All workplaces are subject to change. The pace of change is substantially different from one place to another and frequent changes may create a stressful environment for employees. Change in organizations is an ongoing daily challenge. However, the current business environment, impacted by globalization, has made it necessary for organizations to manage change, and change management has become one of the key management skills.

The purpose of this study is to present two major topics discussed in the literature, namely,

resistance to change and readiness for change.

Change is a migration from the current situation to a desired future situation. Change management as a practical activity is aimed both at configuring the desired situation and at managing the successive transition through several intermediary stages until reaching the desired situation. Change in organizations is represented by any change in an organization’s state of affairs. As a discipline, change management focuses on voluntary organizational change implemented in response to environmental factors or on the organization’s own initiative, a change that must be managed in order to achieve the desired future condition (Srivastava & Agrawal, 2020).

Change management is a complex task, which not only starts at different levels, but must bring together the most diverse interests of those involved in a constructive manner. In this respect, knowing the potential causes of failure is as important as knowing the factors which contribute to success (Lauer, 2021).

Resistance to change is a topic of frequent concern in the literature. The process of change is delayed because of such resistance, which is perceived as a collateral damage of change efforts. Resistance may take many forms, such as deliberate tardiness, resignation, strikes, sabotage of the organization’s property, etc. (Sundus et al, 2017, p.17).

Employees’ resistance to change must be managed by means of support and involvement from the managers. Employee involvement and empowerment are frequently mentioned in the literature as being helpful in reducing resistance to change. Some authors (Sundus et al, 2017, p.18) have presented a better perspective to encourage and support the employees in cope with change, by stating
