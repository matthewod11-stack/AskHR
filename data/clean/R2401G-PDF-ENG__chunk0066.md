## On May 17, 2017, AstraZeneca held World Simpliﬁcation Day to celebrate

saving two million hours in less than two years (twice the original goal!)

and to spread time-saving practices throughout the company.

Bad friction is a plague that undermines productivity and creativity,

raises costs, and frustrates employees, customers, and other

stakeholders. It happens in large part because we default to asking,

“What can I add here?” instead of “What can I get rid of?” But this

penchant can be reversed by leaders who keep talking about and doing

subtraction, teaching people how to practice it, and heaping kudos,

cash, and other goodies on coworkers who remove unnecessary stuﬀ.

Editor’s note: Robert I. Sutton and Huggy Rao are coauthors of The Friction Project: How Smart Leaders Make the Right Things Easier and the Wrong Things Harder (St. Martin’s Press, 2024), from which this article is adapted.
