When organizations restructure, the result is often a decrease in the size of their workforce (Figure .). For example, in , restructuring resulted in , fewer jobs at Yahoo and , fewer at Sprint Nextel. These reductions in force are the result of a variety of factors, including economic difficulties, pressure by stockholders for quick profits, mergers, new technology replacing humans, and employee empowerment programs resulting in less need for managers. Interest- ingly, % of downsizing organizations were profitable the year prior to down- sizing (Cascio, ). Thus, economics is not always the major force driving downsizing. For example, the number of layoffs in  and  rose tremen- dously due primarily to the fallout of the September , , terrorist attacks and accounting scandals at such organizations as Enron and WorldCom.

Reducing the Impact of Downsizing Signs of Problems Short of a catastrophe, organizations usually have some warning that there may be an impending need to downsize. Steps taken at this stage can greatly reduce the need for, or size of, future downsizing (Cascio, ).

A strategy taken by many organizations at this stage is to freeze the hiring of new permanent employees and either not fill vacancies caused by employees leaving or retiring or fill vacancies with temporary employees (temps). Typi- cally, these temps are hired through temporary employment agencies such as Kelly, Olsten, Bright Services, or Manpower. The advantage to using a temporary agency is that temps are not considered employees of the company and thus have no expectation of a future with the company. If business declines, the company can cancel its contract with the temporary agency. If business remains at a good level, the temp remains with the company.

If temps are going to stay with the organization for a long time, it is essential that they be treated like other employees. That is, they should be given the proper training, receive incentives for excellent performance, be given the supplies they need to do their jobs, and be invited to participate in informal activities such as going to lunch or attending a wedding shower (Vines, ).

A related strategy used by more than % of organizations is outsourcing— using outside vendors to provide services previously performed internally. For example, many organizations have found that it is more cost-efficient and pro- ductive to hire an outside vendor to manage their data-processing system than it is to keep five full-time data-processing employees on their payroll. Commonly outsourced functions include employee assistance/wellness programs, benefits and payroll administration, training, data processing, housekeeping, and land- scaping.
