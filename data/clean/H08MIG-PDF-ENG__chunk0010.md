# Employees are Watching

Managers might think that their handling of a situation is between them

and the oﬀender. Misconduct, however, creates ripples in the workplace

that sparks a lot of interest from other employees — even if they were

not directly aﬀected by that employee’s actions. These onlookers closely

monitor managers’ responses to misconduct.

Perceptions about misconduct can vary; the same behavior (such as a

habitually showing up late) might be viewed as a serious problem by

some and not much of an issue by others. However, all variations of

misconduct seem to raise eyebrows. Employees are keenly interested in

how managers respond to misconduct because the manager’s actions

signal critical information about how things work.

Employees expect leaders to punish oﬀenders, even for the minor

wrongs, because it holds oﬀenders accountable, reduces future

misconduct, and protects observers. For these reasons, lenient

managers are generally seen as unfair and irresponsible. Our studies,

which controlled for severity, demonstrated that observing employees

expect misconduct to be punished. Leniency suggests the oﬀender is

getting away with something and that those aﬀected by the misconduct

have been disregarded. Observing employees perceived leniency in

enforcing rules of accountability as unfair, which motivated them to

punish the manager. They expressed their disapproval by withdrawing

support, ignoring the manager’s requests, and engaging in retaliatory
