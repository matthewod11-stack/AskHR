# 3.2 Control variables

It was proposed in the literature that some demographic variables, like selling experience or tenure in a given position can affect the individual motivation to perform through their effect on expectancy and valences and thus, affect performance (Cron et al., 1988). Similar concerns were expressed in a coaching context in the sense that age or organizational tenure might moderate the effect of coaching on behavioral variables (Onyemah, 2009; Tr√©panier, 2010).

In order to rule out the possibility that selling experience, tenure in the position or tenure with the company might inflate or deflate the results of our study, we decided to incorporate these variables as control variables in our model.
