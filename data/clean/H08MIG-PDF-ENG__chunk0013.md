# Details Matter

How observing employees respond to the manager’s leniency also

depends on situational details. The potentially problematic nature of

leniency — of it breaking with standards of punishment — seems to

make onlooking employees consider the context and wonder why the

manager might decide to be lenient.

We found that for a scenario of moderate severity, observers could

suspend their disdain for leniency if they believed the oﬀender was

personally suﬀering and deserved compassion. Picture a coworker that

is habitually late to work and fudges their time sheet but is also is

caring for an ailing spouse, or is struggling to feed their child, or has

been dealing with the clean-up after a natural disaster. Or, as came up

in our research, picture a colleague who comes to work inebriated and

is unable to do their job (such as work mechanical equipment safely),

but who also just learned that their spouse was diagnosed with Stage 4
