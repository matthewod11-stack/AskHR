## Suffering Consequences After Challenging the System

The women we talked to were also advised by well-meaning colleagues

to not voice their discontent, because of career repercussions and social

isolation that might ensue. Abbey told us how many people cautioned

her against complaining about a senior colleague who harassed her:

He made my life miserable during maternity leave, hinting that I

strategically chose to have children during the grant. But my team

members were like, “Even if you leave the organization, getting the

wrong person on your bad side can effectively ruin your career,

especially if it’s someone in your area. So just keep quiet. You don’t

want to be known as a parasite.” Of course I don’t want to be known

as a parasite. So I am scared to open my mouth, to be honest,

although I really want to.

Abbey’s maternity leave was not respected, but her close colleagues

insisted that she should not raise the issue any further, because bringing it up would position her as a “troublemaker” and negatively aﬀect her

career. This instilled a sense of fear that led Abbey to stay silent.
