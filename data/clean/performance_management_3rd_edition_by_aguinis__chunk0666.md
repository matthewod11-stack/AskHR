## Diagnosing the Causes of Poor Performance

She is in charge of designing and delivering interpersonal skills training, including com- munication skills, networking, and new manager training classes. Heather has excellent knowledge of how to design a training class. She incorporates behavioral modeling and practice into all of her classes. She has also conducted research on what good communication consists of, how to network, and what new managers need to know to be suc- cessful. However, individuals who attend Heather’s training

classes often give her low ratings, stating that she has a hard time answering specific questions in classes and that she does not seem approachable after the classes when individuals want to ask questions.
