# Summary Points

- Performance management

is an ongoing process. It never ends. Once established it becomes part of an organization’s culture. The performance management process includes six closely related components: (1) prerequisites, (2) per- formance planning, (3) performance execution, (4) performance assessment, (5) performance review, and (6) per- formance renewal and recontracting. • Job analysis can be conducted using interviews, observation, or off-the-shelf questionnaires. It is important to train individuals to fill out job analysis instruments so as to minimize biases (i.e., self-serving bias, social projection, and false consensus) in the resulting ratings. Once a list of tasks has been compiled, all incumbents should have an opportunity to review the infor- mation and rate each task in terms of its frequency and criticality.

in an organization,

- Each of the six components of the performance management process plays an important role. If any of these com- ponents is implemented poorly, then the entire performance management system suffers. For example, the lack of the organization’s knowledge of

mission and strategic goals and the job in question (i.e., prerequisites) will not allow performance planning (i.e., per- formance road map) to be aligned with organizational goals, which in turn will lead to poor performance execu- tion. In short, a performance manage- ment system is only as good as its weakest component.

- The links between the various compo- nents must be clearly established. For example, performance planning needs to be closely related to performance execution. Performance planning is a futile exercise if execution does not follow from it. The same applies to all the arrows linking the various compo- nents, as shown in Figure 2.1.

- The first component of the perform- ance management process involves two prerequisites. First, there is a need to have good knowledge of the organi- zation’s mission and strategic goals. This knowledge, combined with knowledge regarding the mission and strategic goals of one’s unit, allows employees to make contributions that will have a positive impact on their units and on the organization as a whole. Second, there is a need to have
