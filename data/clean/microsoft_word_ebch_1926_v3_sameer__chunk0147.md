# The Performance Appraisal Process

The performance appraisal process typically follows a set of steps:

- 1. Goal Setting:

The process begins with setting clear, specific, and measurable performance goals and expectations for employees. These goals should align with the organization's objectives.

- 2. Performance Measurement:

Throughout the performance period, employees' progress toward their goals is monitored. Managers collect data on their performance, such as output, quality of work, and behavior.

- 3. Appraisal Meeting:

The actual appraisal meeting is a critical step. During this meeting, the manager and the employee discuss the employee's performance, strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. It's also an opportunity to clarify expectations and address any concerns.
