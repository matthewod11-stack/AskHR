# LITERATURE REVIEW

This research is built on the Resource-based view (RBV) theory. According to RBV, organizations'

resources are essential in accelerating performance and ensuring competitive advantage (Hitt et

al., 2011). This school of thought says that the diversity of a company's resources gives it its

unique competence, which determines its level of ongoing success and helps it grow. (Barney,

1991). Researchers (Barney & Clarke, 2007; Newbert, 2007) say that a company's improved

performance may be due to better use of the company's internal resources. The idea of a

resource-based view (RBV), which focuses on companies' internal capabilities that function as

building blocks to generate competitive advantage and enhance firms' performance (Shah et al.,

2019; Barney, 1991), is highly significant from the standpoint of business performance. RBV looks

at what a company can do on its own, which gives it a competitive edge and improves how well

it does its job. The researcher came up with the idea that better and more long-term growth

needs an accurate assessment of the resources available inside an organization. According to

Morgan et al. (2009), appropriate articulation of an organization's internal resources and the

methodical use of those resources are essential to achieving a competitive edge and maintaining

the firm's development over time. As a result, this research aims to establish a conceptual

framework that considers three significant aspects of Entrepreneurial orientation, Circular

Practice target performance, and firm performance. The business will be more efficient if it

makes suitable investments in its own resources, responds quickly to market changes, looks for

opportunities, and is willing to take risks to put forward new ideas, especially if the circular

practice is developed at the same time.
