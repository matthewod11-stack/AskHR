Document your organization’s approach to DEI in writing.

An internal charter or similar document could set out why the

organization supports DEI, how it deﬁnes the letters of that acronym,

and how that commitment inﬂuences its practices relating to outreach,

recruitment, onboarding, retention, and promotion. The charter could

also explain what the organization does and doesn’t approve with

respect to data collection, diversity targets, diversity training, and other
