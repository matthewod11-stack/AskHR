# their actions and persist with underperformance (Beugré, 2002; Beugré & Offodile, 2001).

Another line of research suggests that informal and formal institutional factors such as local

traditions, culture, law and norms would moderate or curtail the actions of managers when

operating in emerging economies (see Beugré & Offodile, 2001; Peng, 2014). Accordingly,

nepotism can lead to misallocation of the firm’s limited resources and “unfair” decisions

(Ovadje & Ankomah, 2001). Besides the benefits of forging strong ethnic ties in the

workplace, tribalism and nepotism create conditions which make it difficult to “maintain

principles of objectivity and meritocracy” (Ovadje & Ankomah, 2001, p. 184).

Another interesting line of research rooted in legitimacy literature (Baum & Oliver,

1991; Suchman, 1995) has uncovered that firms may persist with underperforming employees

or even hire local workers at a premium as a mere attempt to gain legitimacy in the local

market (Forstenlechner & Mellahi, 2011; Sidani & Al Ariss, 2014). Such hiring of local

workers enables multinationals to appear “local” and in attuned with local traditions and

culture. Forstenlechner and Mellahi (2011) uncovered that multinationals in sectors where the

employment level of nationals is low, hiring or persisting with local workers equipped

multinationals to be able to extract concessions from the national government. As Baum and

Oliver (1991: 187) pointed out so eloquently, “External legitimacy elevates the organisation’s

status in the community, facilitates resource acquisition, and deflects questions about an

organisation’s rights and competence to provide specific products or services.” Therefore,

such external forces from the government can encourage firms to persist with the status quo.

Research has also shown that trade unions have also used their collective bargaining

powers to extract a wage premium for their members as well as protect underperforming

workers from being fired (Atanassov & Kim, 2009; see also The Economist, 2011). Such

external organisations are able to exert pressures which restrict managers’ ability to terminate

employment of workers (Atanassov & Kim, 2009). Indeed, research has also demonstrated

that poorly performing workers are less likely to be fired in an environment where there are

strong union laws in tandem with weak investor protection (Atanassov & Kim, 2009; see also
