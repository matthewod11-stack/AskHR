# Set bold automation goals

How we automate our own work at OpenAI

At OpenAI, we live with AI every day, so we’re often spotting new ways to automate our own work.j

An example: Our support teams were getting bogged down, spending time accessing systems, trying to understand context, craft responses, and take the right actions for customers5

So we built an internal automation platform. It works on top of our existing work7ows and systems to automate rote work and accelerate insight and action5

Our ,rst use case: working on top of Gmail to craft customer responses and trigger actions.h Using our automation platform, our teams can instantly access customer data and relevant knowledge articles, then incorporate the results into response emails or speci,c actions—suchh as updating accounts or opening support tickets3

By embedding AI into existing work7ows, our teams are more e(cient, responsive, and customer- focused. This platform handles hundreds of thousands of tasks every month, freeing people to do more high-impact work. Not surprisingly, the system is now spreading across other departments3

It happened because we set bold automation goals from the start, instead of accepting ine(cient processes as a cost of doing business.
