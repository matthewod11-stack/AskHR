Nor have we tried to make precise predictions about spe- ciﬁc personality constructs, beyond relevant clarifying illustrations. Instead, we focus on some broad issues concerning how that rela- tionship can be productively conceptualized. We believe the time is right to think seriously about the study of personality and affec- tive reactions and think that analysis will be advanced by a more process-oriented discussion of affect. In effect, we are playing to our strengths as affect researchers and hope that the more knowl- edgeable personality researchers who comprise the readers of this volume will bring that knowledge to bear on the conceptual and process issues we address.
