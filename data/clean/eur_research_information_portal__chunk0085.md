# Editorial

of how espousals and enactments could play out at higher and lower-levels of thereby inﬂuencing employee perceptions about whether the leadership, organization’s espoused commitment to inclusion is merely symbolic rather than substantive, and ultimately shaping their inclusion experiences. In recognition of the fact that eliminating discrimination is a precondition for inclusion experiences, we refer to DEI practices more generally in the table.

Conclusion The articles that follow in this special issue reﬂect different elements of our multi-level framework. The article by Shore and Chung (pp. 723–754) is primarily focused on inclusive leadership at the individual-level, un- derstanding that the satisfaction of the fundamental needs underlying in- clusion is determined both by employees’ interactions with the leader as well as with coworkers. Thus, inclusive leadership is inherently cross-level. Similarly, Roberson and Perry (pp. 755–778) discovered in their work that leaders themselves describe inclusive leadership in ways that make it difﬁcult to disentangle individual- and workgroup-focused behaviors and functions. In comparison, the articles by van Knippenberg and van Ginkel (pp. 779–797) and by Leroy and his colleagues (pp. 798–839) focus speciﬁcally on inclusive leadership at the team or workgroup-level of analysis—that is, on leader efforts to shape workgroup processes and outcomes. Finally, Mor Barak and her colleagues links organizational-level (i.e., senior leadership) inclusive leadership with en- actments of inclusive leadership throughout lower-levels of the organization where it impacts employees’ everyday experiences in more tangible ways. We encourage future research to be explicit about the aspects of inclusive leadership on which they are focused and to appropriately align their research designs and measures accordingly.
