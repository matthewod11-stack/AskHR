## HBR / Magazine Article / When Diversity Meets Feedback

A talented writer in his mid twenties, Connor was less ﬂattering. “This

is all right,” he told Richard, “but you completely left your personality

me to leave myself out of my writing, and in this case it made the

piece feel sterile. The fact that Connor comes from a generation where

people self-disclose more openly made it easier for him to pinpoint
