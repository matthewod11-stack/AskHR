# members for future leadership roles.

Use a delegation ladder to clarify expectations and signal trust. For

example, instead of telling a report, “Draft a recommendation and I’ll

decide,” try, “You decide and loop me in only if there’s a risk.” The

more explicit you are, the more conﬁdent others will be. Delegation isn’t

abdication; it’s a strategic investment in your team’s growth.
