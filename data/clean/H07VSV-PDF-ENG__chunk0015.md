# the team.

Help remove obstacles.

A key part of your job as project leader is to help remove obstacles

for the team. This includes re-prioritizing or re-assigning other work,

and re-allocating resources for the project — including people, time,

and budget. According to the Standish Group research, more than 50%

of projects will cost almost double the original budget estimates. “If

possible, reallocate resources to alleviate bottlenecks,” Nieto-Rodriguez

suggests. “This may involve bringing in additional team members,

extending timelines, or securing more budget.”

Another obstacle you can eliminate as project leader is to provide role

clarity for your team members. Role clarity can prevent the duplication

of eﬀort, working at cross-purposes, or the unnecessary friction on the

team and morale issues that come with stepping on other people’s toes.
