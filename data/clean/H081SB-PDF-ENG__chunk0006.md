## database, the Visier Community Data, of more than 4 million live

employee records from nearly 100 companies across the U.S., Canada,

and Europe during the period of 2018 to 2023. We looked at the tenures

and salaries of higher- and lower-performing employees, leveraging

statistical methods to identify patterns and trends in the data. We were

particularly interested in how likely employees were to resign after the

addition of a higher-paid coworker, as well as the extent to which getting

a pay raise might reduce their chances of resigning.
