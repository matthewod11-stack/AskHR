# Training Developments

Although there were only a few programs at the beginning of this period, at least 18 (including 5 doctoral programs) were identiﬁed by the time of the Thayer Conference, and about 100 programs speciﬁcally on school psychology existed by 1970. However, APAaccreditation of school psychology pro- grams was not accomplished until 1971. Thus, during this period, programs were developed in the absence of ofﬁcial APAcurriculum standards, although some programs used the guidelines being developed by Division 16 in its effort to achieve accreditation. Programs were more often devel- oped to comply with the requirements for certiﬁcation and licensure put forth by state-level education and psychology boards. By the end of this period, school psychology pro- grams were widespread in the more populous states, espe- cially east of the Mississippi River, and approximately 3,000 students were in training. Locally developed and uncoordi- nated efforts provided internships for trainees in most states, although a few, like Ohio, developed a statewide system of paid internships by the mid-1960s.
