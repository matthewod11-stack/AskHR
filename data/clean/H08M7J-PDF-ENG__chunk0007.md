# Emotional whiplash

Survivors of layoﬀs can ﬁnd themselves navigating a sea of emotions

that can shift unexpectedly from day to day. On the one hand, you

may experience happiness, gratitude, and relief that you were “chosen”

to remain. At the same time, you may also grapple with a profound

sense of guilt from having a job when others lost theirs and grieve

the departure of close colleagues and the organization you thought

you knew. You may feel exhausted as you struggle to reconcile and manage these conﬂicting emotions (e.g., “I should be thrilled, but I

don’t feel that way”). Emotional contagion can also ripple through the

organization, leading to a collective sense of loss and grief.
