Much like the many digitization efforts that have come before, AI

brings tremendous potential to help transform how work is done, and

even access work that we didn’t think was possible. Consider that ER

doctors hit an average of 4,000 keystrokes in a 10-hour shift — imagine

all the good that could be accomplished from repurposing that eﬀort,

time, and mental energy by not just replacing some of this work, but

also augmenting intelligence to help improve eﬀectiveness and speed.
