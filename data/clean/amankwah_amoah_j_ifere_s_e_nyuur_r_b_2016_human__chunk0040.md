# Favouritism through tribalism

The field work revealed that workers’ upward movements, demotion and dismissal of

underperforming workers appeared to be moderated by favouritism through tribalism and

13

corruption. The data suggest that virtually all the informants in public sector organisations

emphasised that the most significant factor for the retention of underperforming employees in

the public sector in Nigeria and Ghana is tribalism. By tribalism, we are referring to the

tendency of managers and line managers to favour other employees from their tribe with

regard to work practices such as firing, hiring and promotion (see Beugré & Offodile, 2001).

This implies that superior officers or heads of establishments overlook the inefficiency of

their subordinates if they belong to the same tribe. For instance, Nigeria is a traditional

society in which the tribal units struggle for dividends of the country’s resources. An

informant (N38), who has worked for a private sector organisation and is now in the public

sector, stated that the pressure for conformance to tribal sentiment is higher in the public

sector due to low requirements for leadership accountability. One informant in Ghana

explained:

“We have so many incompetent workers that you will not believe it … when you visit

government department, you see blatant tribalism and favouritism everywhere … the Ewes

protect Ewes, Asantes protect Asantes and Gas protect Gas (local tribes)… superiors of each

protect their own kind and look the other way.” (G19)

Our field work indicates that persistence with poor performance, corruption and

governance is partly entrenched in tribalism. The informants observed that the slogan in the

workplace environment in government agencies is “tribal politics remains alive and well”

which corrupts decision making processes to the detriment of competent employees. In the

setting of publicly-owned organisations, it has been suggested that departments often

resemble the family and ethnic character of the senior official or minister (see also Ovadje &

Ankomah, 2001). Tribe has been rendered more potent in both societies largely due to the

fact that people have historically blamed other tribes for unemployment and poor education

in another tribe. Some tribes are considered to be “lazy” and “shy away from work” which

then provides the ammunition for some managers to seek to protect and preserve the job of

14

their fellow tribal members. There are often complex “tribe alliances” and mini groups who

protect their kind. Many of the decision-makers are seen as “tribal champions” who advanced

the interest of their kind often irrespective of competence. Another noted,

“The government official said they have policy to have people from his ethic group so

we cannot fire him.”

An informant summarised the effects of tribalism by noting that, “It is sad that this

society remains tribal … our agency hire people based on their tribe and when they do not

perform we still keep them.” (G18)

“It’s the T-word … tribalism is the root of this problem in the public sector.” (G17)

Some of the informants attributed persistence to favouritism. As some informants noted:

“I think it stems from both favouritism and tribalism. My co-worker has benefited from this.”

“Most often the employees are a family relation to the owner of the company or he or she is
