# reporting.

Another usual suspect for low-value work is in administrative tasks,

and long, involved forms or approval processes, as the hospital example

above shows. Organizations with “process-heavy” cultures also tend

to “over-process” everything they do, when many decisions, tasks, or

projects should be handled in a simpler way. Additionally, review and

rework of documents takes up a lot of time unnecessarily when “good

enough” (as above) will get the job done. And of course, there are almost

always meetings that don’t need to happen or could be signiﬁcantly

shortened.

What could you experiment with stopping, changing, or reducing?

Remember, if you eliminate something that does matter, you can always

restore it. We have found that teams are much more comfortable

stopping or simplifying work when they embrace the “two-way door”
