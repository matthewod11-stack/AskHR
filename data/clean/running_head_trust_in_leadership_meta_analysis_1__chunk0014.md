# Introduction

Since the global financial crisis of 2007, trust in business has fallen to record lows. For

instance, public trust in CEOs has dropped to 31% in developed countries (Edelman Trust

Barometer, 2016). Engendering trust has been a central tenet of different organisational

leadership theories and robust relationships have been found between employees’ trust in

their leader and important outcomes (e.g., Ng, 2017; Podsakoff et al., 1990; Schaubroeck et

al., 2011). Research, for example, consistently shows that the trust which exists between a

leader and a follower is associated with increased follower job performance and

organisational citizenship behaviour and negatively related to undesirable outcomes such as

followers’ intention to quit (see Colquitt et al., 2007; Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). Trust, as a

willingness to be vulnerable and accept risk in relationships (Mayer et al., 1995), is therefore

a valued asset which leaders seek to foster and develop with their employees. An increasing

body of evidence suggests that trust-related characteristics are seen as being universally

important for leadership effectiveness (Den Hartog, 2018). The question then is, how can

leaders’ best harness that ‘willingness’ and what style of leadership is most suited for

facilitating trust?

Around two decades ago, Dirks and Ferrin (2002) first meta-analysed the primary

relationships of trust in leaders with antecedents, correlates and outcomes. However, due to

the relative immaturity of the literature at the time they did not capture, beyond

transformational and transactional leadership, how different leadership styles relate to trust.

In recent years, several new leadership constructs have emerged in the literature. Given the

frequency with which trust is proffered as an explanatory mechanism for the impact of these

styles (e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Den Hartog, 2015; Miao et al., 2014), our meta-analysis offers
