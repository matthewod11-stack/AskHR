## HBR / Digital Article / Do You Manage Too Many People?

Manage up and down Another diﬃculty of leading a large team is balancing your own

professional needs with those of your team. You have to manage

upwards — to provide the right level of detail to your boss to ensure

you and your team members receive the recognition you deserve —

while also coaching your employees and providing feedback on their

performance, says McDowell. It’s a balancing act. She advises taking a

Goldilocks approach. If the issues that consume your day are too small,

you’re being too tactical and are likely interfering. If they’re too big,

you’re not connected to what’s occurring on the front line. “But when

they’re just right you’ll have a pulse for what’s happening on the ground

and you’re able to spend time on longer term strategic priorities and on

mentoring your teams.”

Be mindful of your tone and persona — especially when it comes to how

you interact with your team, says Gupta. “A lot of bosses are good at

managing up but not managing down,” he says. “You don’t have to be

selﬂess, but if your direct reports sense you care more about your own

advancement that’s going to hurt you in the long run.”
