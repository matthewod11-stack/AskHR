The beauty of a harassment task force is that it allows solutions to be tailored to the needs of a given company.

leaders committed to changing the culture. This approach is less expensive than using outside trainers, and it’s much more effective than tick-the-box online courses.

Promisingly, it’s getting some traction. Sharyn Potter’s team at the University of New Hampshire uses a train-the-trainer model to address assault and harassment on college cam- puses. The University of Michigan has developed a fine-tuned model as part of its diversity-recruitment training. The U.S. Air Force has adopted a train-the- trainer model to deal with sexual assault, dating violence, and domestic violence throughout its ranks. Whether you train 10 trainers or 1,000, you’ve created a group of experts committed to change. If you hire a train-the-trainer organization, however, choose carefully: Some still spend most of their time on the failed forbidden-behavior curriculum.

Harassment task forces. When we conducted research on diversity programs, we discovered that establish- ing a task force is the single best way to improve diversity in the workplace. It also promises to help curb harassment by engaging more people. A CEO might commission a harassment task force and ask department chiefs to join it or send a lieutenant. The task force can look at HR data on harassment complaints, inter- view people across the company about their experiences, study company data on what kinds of workers are quitting, and more. Once the members have figured out what and where their company’s spe- cific problems are, they can brainstorm solutions and take them back to their own departments. Maybe they’ll decide that work teams need to be mixed up so

that women aren’t so often outnum- bered. Maybe they’ll decide that the com- pany needs to get more women involved in recruitment or more men involved in conducting harassment training.

The beauty of this approach is that it allows solutions to be tailored to the needs of a given company. Who bet- ter to dream up those solutions than people who know the workplace and the culture? And how better to align your managers and employees with the goal of stemming harassment than by putting them on the task force? That’s a lesson straight out of Psych 101: The best way to convert people to your cause is to get them to help you with it.

Published numbers. There’s some- thing to the adage “You can’t manage what you can’t measure”—or in this case, “what you don’t measure.”

If you publish data that exposes a problem, managers will focus on it, and solving the problem will become part of the culture. Uber was acting on this principle when it published the number of sexual assaults that allegedly took place in its vehicles in 2018. Tech firms have acted on it by publishing data on diversity in their workforces, and Intel recently published pay data for men and women, whites, and people of color. Emilio Castilla, of MIT’s Sloan School of Management, has conducted cutting-edge research demonstrating the efficacy of this approach when it comes to pay. Your ombuds office could post the number of complaints, broken down by department. An annual employee survey could surface problems by department and location. Most managers have no idea how their own departments are faring, because people rarely file formal

complaints. Shining a light on where problems lie can change the culture.

COURTS HAVE BEEN allowed to dictate how companies handle harassment for too long. Rates of harassment haven’t budged for decades. The work that we and others have done suggests that we can’t solve the problem by tagging all men as potential harassers in training sessions or by making victims navigate a complaint system designed to prevent the accused from suing. The research suggests that what’s most helpful is to design training that treats all work- ers as victims’ allies and gives them problem-solving tools, and to design complaint systems that provide the typical victim with a quick response that doesn’t spark retaliation.

In the end, though, we need to change corporate cultures to get more people involved in solving the problem. Culture is ultimately created by leaders. They need to publicly take responsibility for the problem and try to solve it on their teams, setting an example for all managers. Increasing the numbers of female managers and executives may help as well, because women are less likely to react negatively to training and more likely to believe victims who come forward with complaints. That might encourage victims to come forward and make it more likely that they get satisfac- tion from the complaint process.
