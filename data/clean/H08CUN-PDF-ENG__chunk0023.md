# Advocate for your team

On the other hand, your team might harbor resentment toward the

organization — leadership decisions that seem nonsensical or reward

systems that are misaligned. When systemic issues fester as resentment,

it can undermine your team’s motivation and productivity, notes

Carucci. That’s why it’s vital to communicate your team’s concerns

to your bosses, stressing the impact on morale and advocating for

necessary changes. Demonstrating to your team that you support them

and have their back fosters trust. At the very least, he says, you can act

as a buﬀer, shielding them from the dysfunctions of the organization.

“Create a quarantine from the systemic issues and policies that are

plaguing your team,” he says. “Be their ﬁrst line of defense.”
