tion in hiring, promotion, termination, and pay; proactive training; salary equity analysis; and a host of other things. It is our job to keep our clients out of trouble as well as to assist them when they are under investigation by the Depart- ment of Labor or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

As one of the many hats I wear as president of the firm, I conduct training seminars and speaking sessions on HR risk management. The training seminars range from highly technical and statistical to non- technical issues that are softer in content. I find training to be one of the most interesting and challenging aspects of my job. Each time I conduct a training program, something new and different comes up based upon the participants and the orga- nization’s culture.

One thing I have learned over the years is that not every- one is born to be an effective

trainer. There are tips, however, that you can follow that, with practice, can help facilitate your performance as a trainer. With that being said, here is my top 10 list of things that will help make you a good trainer.

There is a difference between technical and nontechnical training. Soft-skills training and techni- cal training are very different types of training. I find it much more challenging to present technical material over soft- skills material. Eight hours of statistics training can be quite boring. Use exercises, case studies, and other things to keep people engaged. A joke here and there also goes a long way. Know the technical mate- rial of your training and plan accordingly.

Trainers are like wine—they get better over time. It takes lots of time and experi- ence to be a really good trainer.

Be patient. You will have your fair share of times when you don’t perform well. For your first training program, start by practicing in front of a mirror, then making the move to pres- ent in front of your friends or family, and finally taking the plunge into your first training. It gets easier as you get more experience and practice.

Get to know your audience prior to the training. It is very important to have a firm understanding of who is going to be in the training session. Prior to your training, find out the knowledge level of the participants, number of participants, their attitude toward attending the seminar, organizational culture, issues within the company that may relate to your training, and so forth. This will help you get an understanding of the company and the participants and will enable you to tailor the training to their needs and

Preparing for Classroom Training Adjusting for the Audience The characteristics of the audience play an important role in developing a train- ing program. A trainer must consider the size, demographics, and ability of the audience. For example, with a large audience, not only will the trainer need to use a microphone, but it becomes difficult to supplement lecture material with such exercises as role play, simulation, and group discussion. An audience of women often will react differently to certain examples and types of exercises than will an audience of men. Likewise, examples used for a younger audience might not work on an older audience.

The ability level of the audience members is another important factor. If they are low on experience or ability, the training will need to proceed at a slower pace than if they were more experienced or more skilled. The toughest situation for a trainer is when the audience has mixed levels of ability. If the trainer sets a
