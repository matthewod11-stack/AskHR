Consider how the prerequisites component in Figure 11.2 is implemented at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD).13 This university, as are many others around the world, is structured around academic and administrative units called departments. Each of these departments can be considered a team. In terms of the prerequisites component, individual departments at UCSD develop a mission statement that is clearly related to the overall university’s mission. This process allows each member of the team to become knowledgeable regarding the university’s overall mission. After the department’s mission has been established, individual job descriptions are discussed and directly linked to both the mission of the university and the mission of the department. Job descriptions include KSAs needed for both individ- ual and department performance.
