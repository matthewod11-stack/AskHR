# The Doctrine's Exceptions

At-will employment rule faces rejection by courts in 40 to 45 states. The at-will

employment doctrine is used in 49 states with the exception of Montana. Court rulings on

this issue have altered the effect on at-will employment, by direct holdings or with strong

dicta stated in the reported cases. Such modifications of the doctrine are embedded in

three theories. The three theories are, breach of employment contract, followed by bad-

faith discharge and public policy tort. In respect to breach of employment contract, the

courts have ruled that the employer has "entered an expressed or implied contract with an

employee that provided that the employee may be terminated only for cause or in

accordance with established policies and procedures" (Aalberts et al., 1993). The second

theory is bad-faith discharge. This "cause of action is also referred to as the "implied

covenant of good faith and fair dealing," whereby the employer breaches a contract in bad

faith after the employee has developed a relationship of trust, reliance, and dependency

with the employer" (Aalberts et al., 1993). The last theory is public-policy tort, which is

siwilar to bad-faith discharge. ~Â·An employer who discharges an employee for a reason

that violates public policy may have committed this tort" (Aalberts et al., 1993). No

contract is necessary for this cause of action (Aalberts et al., 1993). The four main public

policy protections are serving jury duty, refusal to committee and illegal act on the behalf

of the employer, whistle blowing on an individual or the company itself and :filling
