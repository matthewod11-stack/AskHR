## HBR / Magazine Article / Learning Emerging Skills Doesn’t Always Pay Off

How do you recommend managers redesign their skills programs to

realize the benefits of strengthening core skills?

HR and leadership need to work together to understand job requirements

and employee skills. Managers must focus on closing the gaps between

skills supply and demand. It’s about supporting continuous development,

and it requires data gathering and analysis to understand the size and

nature of gaps across a team or unit. Once the gaps are identified,

managers can work with HR to target strategies to close them. This may

involve training, development programs, or hiring new talent. The goal is

to ensure that the organization has the right skills—core and emerging—to

meet its strategic objectives.
