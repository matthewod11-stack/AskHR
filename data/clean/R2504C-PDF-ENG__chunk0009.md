## HBR / Magazine Article / “Speed Is a Leadership Decision”

senior leaders, and we’ve already changed 375 processes. That visibility

has helped us address some of the red tape deep in the organization.

What’s behind your return-to-ofﬁce policy?

After the pandemic our people were largely working remotely. We brought them back to the oﬃce in May 2023, three days a week,

and noticed that a lot of things about how we were inventing and

collaborating got better. We were in meetings together. We were

iterating with one another. When you’re together, that invention is

stronger. People riﬀ on top of one another’s ideas better when they’re

together. It turns out, it can be useful to interrupt each other because

you get to a spot more quickly. You feel that energy. A lot of our best

inventions have come after messy, wandering meetings, when a few

people stayed behind and worked on a whiteboard to map out whatever

it was they couldn’t ﬁgure out. When you’re remote, the meeting ends

and you’re on to the next thing.

Are you now totally committed to in-ofﬁce work, ﬁve days a week?

We’ve realized the teaching and apprenticeship are much better if you

can walk over to somebody after a meeting and say, “That was a hard meeting. This is a really diﬃcult topic. Next time, think about these

three things.” You just don’t end up doing this as much when you’re

remote. And we realized that it’s much better for our customers and our

business if we’re together.

Data that we’ve published has shown that working from home can increase productivity and that the workforce by and large wants it. Do you think that data is wrong, or are you saying that there are intangibles that outweigh those ﬁndings?

I think it’s hard to measure these things, truthfully, and our data doesn’t

suggest what you’ve just described. When I look at the data, it’s hard

to measure. How do you measure how well you’re inventing? You don’t

actually know for a few years. I spend a good amount of my own time
