# Defamation

A potential employer who fails to conduct thorough reference checks that might have revealed the potential risk of a new employee may be guilty of negligent hiring, if the new employee causes harm to another at work. A previous employer who fails to warn about an employee's known propensity to violence may also be guilty of negligent referral. It serves as a reminder to HR that we must actively gather information on new recruits while maintaining proper employment records on current employees in order to be able to give verifiable and trustworthy reference information when necessary. Many organisations use criminal background checks, credit checks, and Internet searches to find information on job seekers due to the difficulty in collecting information from previous employers. According to statistics from SHRM, 96 percent of employers checked applicants' backgrounds in 2006, up from 66 percent just ten years prior.

Although contentious, if the candidate has given the required consent, these background checks are not against the law. Make sure your applicant signs the necessary release paperwork before running any background checks on them.
