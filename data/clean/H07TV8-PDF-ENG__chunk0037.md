# Horizontal Separation

A variation of this separation approach that extends beyond governance

would be to construct “temporal business units,” each charged

with developing capabilities or oﬀerings on diﬀerent time horizons,

according to life stage of each business. Senior leadership’s role would

be to weigh and synthesize these diﬀerent perspectives, which might

contradict or synergize with one another.

One illustration of this is Alphabet’s diﬀerentiated approach to machine

learning and AI development. Google is responsible for short-term

improvements to the technology underlying its search algorithm, while

DeepMind is focused on developing an artiﬁcial general intelligence

in the long term — though their breakthroughs may also have more

immediate payoﬀs, as with the recent introduction of the Bard chatbot,

which emerged from a collaboration between both groups.
