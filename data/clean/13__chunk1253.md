## Third Party Interventions across Cultures

make suggestions for settlement or to actually dictate a resolution (Leung & Stephan, 1998). In fact, disputants in this situation might actually feel that the third party was ‘‘shirking’’ their responsibility if disputants were asked to come up with their own solutions. There is evidence that disputants in hierarchical cultures prefer the early involvement of a third party in dealing with conﬂicts rather than trying to resolve them on their own (e.g., Brett, 2001), where disputants may be more satisﬁed and committed to a solution if they themselves have had a major part in creating it (Pruitt, 1981).

Transaction Costs of the Procedure Some procedures require more time and resources (e.g., money) for both disputants and the third party. Brett et al. (1996) report that participants believe that mediation is less expensive than adjudication or arbitration. While arbitration costs are typically low (certainly lower than adjudication), they may be somewhat higher for double FOA (where the third party must spend extra time in order to evaluate four proposals) and for night baseball arbitration (where the third party must take the time to write a non-binding decision and then take additional time to compare it with each side’s offer and select a winner). Med-arb may be, on average, cheaper than arb-med because some (if not most) cases will settle in the mediation phase. However, with arb-med, the costs of an arbitration hearing must be borne even if the parties settle in mediation, because the arbitration hearing precedes mediation. Fact-ﬁnding can occur before any of the formalized procedures as a preliminary step to encourage parties to come up with a voluntary agreement. In this sense, if another procedure follows fact-ﬁnding, additional costs must be considered for the subsequent procedure. If, however, the fact- ﬁnding recommendation dissuades parties from engaging in a subsequent procedure and they ﬁnd a voluntary settlement, the costs of the additional procedure are avoided.

If one takes the position that time is money (e.g., third parties often charge by the hour), third party procedures that lead to a speedy resolution of the dispute will be less costly, and preferred, to more costly procedures. But, the ‘‘time is money’’ view of the world is likely to be more of a Western value. In collectivist cultures, for example, third parties and disputants might feel that a signiﬁcant investment in time is well worth the maintenance of harmony, and in some very delicate situations, third parties may have a preference to spend more time making sure that disputants are treated well, that the relationship between them is maintained or improved, or that the underlying drivers of the dispute are addressed and resolved.3

DONALD E. CONLON ET AL.

Even within the US, some disputes may beneﬁt from a heightened sensitivity to relationship and the concomitant time demands. In instances where a transaction dispute is embedded within a valued, ongoing relationship, investment of time and resources in the short term can pay dividends over a longer term in the form of cooperative behavior and trust. Conversely, even in collectivist cultures, where the focus on relationships are heightened (compared with individualist cultures), some one-off transac- tions may beneﬁt from a greater focus on time-cost savings at the expense of the relationship.

This discussion of dimensions related to process criteria and the cultural implications of these dimensions for third party procedures leads to the following testable propositions.

Proposition 1. Third parties in egalitarian and individualist cultures will impose less pressure on disputants and make fewer suggestions for settlement during mediation procedures, relative to third parties in hierarchical and collectivist cultures.

Proposition 2. Transaction costs (e.g., time, money) will be of greater importance to disputants from egalitarian and individualistic cultures, compared with disputants from hierarchical and collectivist cultures. However, within egalitarian and individualistic cultures, transaction cost importance will also be dependent on expectations of future interaction among disputants. Thus, we expect to see a higher degree of variance in the importance of transaction costs among egalitarian and individualistic cultures, as compared with hierarchical or collectivist cultures.

Proposition 3. Procedures that allow individuals to have voice and to take part in generating the solutions will be perceived more favorably in egalitarian and individualist cultures, as compared with hierarchical and collectivist cultures.
