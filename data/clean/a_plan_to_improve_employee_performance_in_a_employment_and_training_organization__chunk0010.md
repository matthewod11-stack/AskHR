This paper represents hard work, personal sacrifice and a will life. Accomplishing a major goal in my life has been achieved, and I would this opportunity to make a personal dedication to my parents, Ted & Marci Alvarez, who have been influential in the direction of my career and accomplishments. I dedicate this to them, because without their love and support this.goal could not have been achieved.Â· Thank you and I Love You.
