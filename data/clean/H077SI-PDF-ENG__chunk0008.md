## HBR / Digital Article / Quiet Quitting Is About Bad Bosses, Not Bad Employees

Many people, at some point in their career, have worked for a manager

that moved them toward quiet quitting. This comes from feeling

undervalued and unappreciated. It’s possible that the managers were

biased, or they engaged in behavior that was inappropriate. Employees’

lack of motivation was a reaction to the actions of the manager.

Most mid-career employees have also worked for a leader for whom they

had a strong desire to do everything possible to accomplish goals and

objectives. Occasionally working late or starting early was not resented

because this manager inspired them.
