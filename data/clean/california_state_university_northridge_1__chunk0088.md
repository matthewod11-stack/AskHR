## In recent developments, employees of ITT Cannon, a Phoenix division ofITT

Corp., filled a lawsuit against the company regarding the contents of the employee

handbook as it related to layoffs and benefits. The handbook stated in the event of

layoffs, employees would be let go on the basis of seniority. When layoff did occur,

employees were not laid off with seniority as criteria. The employee handbook, that was

in existence more than thirty years was up dated with that particular provision not

included. However, the handbook did state, "all provisions are subject to modification or

revocation without notice" (Balzer, 1997, p. 23). This case came before the Arizona

Supreme Court to decide on contents of the employee handbook. "The court ruled May

25 that business owners must uphold company policies in old employee handbooks even if

the policies have been changed and new handbooks issued" (Teichgraeber, 1999, p. 1 ).

Furthermore, "The court determined that handbook policies could be considered contracts

of employment unless a disc!ai.mer states otherwise. The disclaimer also must say that the

company has the right to change policies at any time" Teichgraeber, 1999, p. 1). This

ruling also means that employers must compensate employees for lost benefits
