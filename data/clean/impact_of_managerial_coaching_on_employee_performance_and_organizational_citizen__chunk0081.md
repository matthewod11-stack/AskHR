In table 6 (β value (c`) = 0.324, t=4.303 >2, F=38.244>5 & sig=0.000), which is showing that managerial coaching has a positive impact on in-role performance. This demonstrates that one unit change in managerial coaching carries 0.324-unit change into in-role job performance, which supports H1. A study conducted by Kim and Kuo, (2015), found no relationship between managerial coaching and in-role performance, but in this study this relationship is exist. Because, when managers act as a coach and build good relations, support their subordinates, valuing the work of their employees, then these behaviors build a learning and healthy environment, then reciprocally employee perform bettter. In this study further found an intervening effect by multiplying a*b, 0.401*0.395=0.1584, which support H4. It means employees who feel thrive in their workplace; they perform better as compared to those who didn’t get coaching and thriving environment. For measuring the significance of mediation effect, Sobel test was used.
