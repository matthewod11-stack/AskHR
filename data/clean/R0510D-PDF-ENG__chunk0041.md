# The Processes of Strategy

mary responsibility for most of these pro- cesses, but not all. For example, in 2004, the OSM led the project team that developed the strategy maps and scorecards for the en- terprise, our three operating divisions, and two support units—human resources and information technology. For some pro- cesses, however, the OSM’s role is more inte- grative and facilitative than direct. For ex- ample, the chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer has primary responsibility for budgeting, with the OSM playing a coordinating role.

We launched the OSM with three full- time individuals. The OSM leader is a vice president and a member of the executive management team; her position in the orga- nization is consistent with the importance we give this function. She leads and facili- tates the integration of strategy into all our core processes. In addition, we have two in- dividuals reporting to the OSM leader to provide day-to-day management of the of- ﬁce; to manage the multiple work streams and cross-functional teams; to lead and facil- itate meetings; to educate people on the Bal- anced Scorecard and other strategy-focused practices and tools; and to perform analyses of problems, performance, and metrics. This should be the right complement of individu- als to help support the leader of the OSM, and ultimately the rest of the executive team, in undertaking our ambitious change agenda for this year.
