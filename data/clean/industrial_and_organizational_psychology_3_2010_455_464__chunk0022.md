# OtherBarriers

The commentaries discuss three additional barriers to cross-fertilization. First, as Staw (2010) astutely observes, the handoff of the research baton from JDM to IOOB—or vice versa—will not necessarily be seamless or even pleasant. For example, as we alluded to in a previous section (see also Whyte, 2010), the JDM perspective on goal- setting appears to have been somewhat unsettling to IOOB researchers. Each ﬁeld must be prepared to make concessions and must remain open to the possibility of inconvenient truths emanating from the other ﬁeld. It is worth remembering that, as Reb (2010) puts it in his commentary, ‘‘[d]ifferences, rather than similarities, open up opportunities for value creation.’’
