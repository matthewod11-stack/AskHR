# Self-Regulation Theory

An interesting extension on goal setting and feedback is the concept of self- regulation. In the previous section we discussed how it is important to get feedback on goal attainment. Though this feedback often comes from others, the idea behind self-regulation theory is that employees monitor their own progress toward attaining goals and then make the necessary adjustments; that is, they self-regulate.

For example, suppose that an employee has a goal of completing a -page report in two weeks. If there are ten working days in the two-week period, the employee might determine that she should complete ten pages a day. After two days, the employee counts the number of pages written and compares it with where she thought she should be after two days ( pages). If she has written only ten pages, she has some choices to make. Should she change her goal to give

herself more time to complete the report, or perhaps change the goal so that the report will be shorter? Should she change her behavior so that she quits working on other projects and concentrates only on the report? Should she work longer hours or get more help so she can complete the report in two weeks?

Though this example describes self-regulation of a specific task (writing a report), employees obviously have many goals, some of which are complex and some that might compete with other goals. For example, an employee might have goals of increasing her job knowledge (learning goal orientation), performing at a high level (performance goal orientation), making a lot of money, advanc- ing within the organization, having a full social life, and spending quality time with the family. If the employee wanted to attend a weeklong seminar to increase her skills, would it come at the expense of her goals to perform at a high level and to spend time with her family? With multiple complex goals, self-regulation becomes more difficult, and employees must make a conscious effort to be aware of their goals, monitor their goal progress, and set priorities so that decisions can be made when encountering competing goals.
