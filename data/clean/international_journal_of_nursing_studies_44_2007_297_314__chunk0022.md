## 2.4. The link between job satisfaction and turnover

According to Hellman (1997), increasing dissatisfac- tion in employees in a higher chance of considering other employment opportunities. In his meta-analysis of US studies of non-nursing workers, the relationship between job satisfaction and intent to leave was found to be signiﬁcantly different from zero and consistently negative. These ﬁndings were reiterated in nursing research with many authors concluding that increasing job satisfaction decreased rates of turnover (Saleh et al., 1965; Price and Mueller, 1981; Cavanagh and Cofﬁn, 1992). Seccombe and Smith (1997) found that the factors given by nurses as reasons for leaving were centred on issues known to affect job satisfaction such as ineffective supervisory relationships and poor opportunities for professional development, rather than external labour market forces of which managers would justiﬁably feel unable to control.
