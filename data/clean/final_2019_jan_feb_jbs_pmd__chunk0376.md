This is the table that shows the output of the ANOVA analysis and whether there is a statistically significant difference between group means. We can see that the significance value is 0.000 (i.e., p = .000), which is below 0.05. and, therefore, there is a statistically significant association between the Memberâ€™s performance and social status/caste. This is great to know, but we do not know which of the specific groups differed. Hence, we use find this out in the Multiple Comparisons table which contains the results of the Tukey post hoc test.

Post Hoc Tests From the results so far, we know that there are statistically significant differences between the groups as a whole. The table below, Multiple Comparisons, shows which groups differed from each other. The Tukey post hoc test is generally the preferred test for conducting post hoc tests on a one-way ANOVA, but there are many others. We can see from the table below that there is a there is no significance in the Gro up Performances between the SC/ST, OBC and Gen.
