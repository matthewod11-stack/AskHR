## that same employee in evaluations, consistently rating them as less

committed and less promotable than their colleague.

This penalty persisted even when the detaching employee was a

manager’s direct report, when the detaching employee was objectively

better at their job, when neither of the employees actually did any work

during their time oﬀ, and when the reason for detachment was virtuous

(e.g., caring for a sick family member).

Perhaps our most eye-opening ﬁnding? The eﬀect was just as strong

among managers who say they value work-life balance as it was

among those who do not. Even managers who report having explicitly

encouraged detachment in their organizations penalized detaching

employees in our studies. That is not just inconsistent and unfair, it

is a recipe for a burnout culture.
