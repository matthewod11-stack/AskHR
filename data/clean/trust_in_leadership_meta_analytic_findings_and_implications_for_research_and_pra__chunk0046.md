## Moderator Analysis for Definition of Trust

The relationships for which the sample sizes were sufficient to permit a moderator analysis for definition are reported in Table 4. Ninety-four percent of the studies were categorized as having used cognitive trust or overall trust. The few studies that used affective trust were dispersed across relationships, resulting in an insuffi- cient number of studies in any one relationship to conduct analyses.

The chi-square test showed significant (p (cid:5) .05) heterogeneity in the correlations for each of the antecedent variables except for propensity to trust and length of relationship. Again, the significant heterogeneity indicates that moderating variables are likely to be operative.
