# Predictive analysis:

Predictive analysis, as stated by Fitz-En (2010), is the insight to the future, and <the greatest

outcomes based on patterns and trends in the data with the underlying assumption that the past

event and trend tend to happen again in the future. Predictive analysis can be as simple as
