# Start within.

The road to your higher ethical ambition starts with personal reﬂection

about your values and purpose in life. Take the time to have an honest

conversation with yourself to help ﬁgure out what matters to you, and

where your ethics lie.

To start, write down key decisions you made in your life (for example,

choice of job, spouse, and friends) and then ask yourself what motivated

these decisions and what they say about you. For example, a newly

appointed division manager, trained in accounting, reﬂected on why he

chose to work for his company despite better offers and realized that it was

the friendly, collaborative, and ethical culture. He then used this

information to help deﬁne who he wanted to be as a leader.
