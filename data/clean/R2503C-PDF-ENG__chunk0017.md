## HBR / Magazine Article / Lean Strategy Making

There should be a sizable gap between the ambition and the MYO. If

they’re too close, the ambition isn’t enough of a stretch and should

be revised upward. The gap will be closed by addressing issues on

what we call the strategic backlog—a document that captures the

company’s highest-priority strategic, operational, organizational, and

ﬁnancial challenges. Those issues should be prioritized using two criteria: value at stake, or the economic impact of eﬀectively resolving

the issue; and urgency or critical path—whether the issue must be

tackled immediately to avoid missing a crucial opportunity or to help

address other important problems. The backlog should guide decision-

making throughout the current year and beyond. Typically, companies

have multiple backlogs: one for senior leadership, encompassing

cross-enterprise issues, and separate backlogs for the business units,

addressing their speciﬁc challenges.

The issues on the backlog need to be described in careful detail to

ensure their proper framing. As we all know, it’s hard to ﬁnd the

right answer if the wrong question is being asked. Yet many leaders

deﬁne strategic priorities in ways that limit the ﬁeld of vision (for

example, by asking, “Should we acquire Company X in order to enter

Market Y?” rather than “How should we increase our penetration of

Market Y?”), unduly constraining their options. Or leaders widen the aperture too much, making the issue impossible to address eﬀectively

(as with “How should we adapt our strategy to best respond to global

climate change?”). In either case cogent plans are never developed, and

problems go unresolved for years.

Each item on the backlog should be tied to one or more decisions

that must be made to address it. For an example, let’s look at Dell

Technologies, the infrastructure technology giant. In 2015 its leadership

determined that to achieve breakthrough performance, it needed to
