Connectors are most successful and satisﬁed in companies where

inclusion is a top priority—companies where community building is

necessary to sustain a healthy leadership pipeline or to integrate the

values and views of diﬀerent groups. These are organizations where

the viability of the business and the vitality of the community are

understood to go hand in hand—which would be most companies,

when you think about it.

In my experience, custodians frequently are assumed to be the best

ﬁt for business, and as noted, challengers are often hired as tokens of

innovative thinking but given little support. It seems to me that both

those patterns stem from the fact that most businesses focus excessively

on alignment and as a result wrestle with innovation, inclusion,

and sustainability. With their integrative approach, connectors help

companies overcome those problems.
