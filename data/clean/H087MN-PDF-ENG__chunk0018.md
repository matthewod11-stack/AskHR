# Cultivate ownership and involvement

Empowering team members to actively contribute to the transition

process can signiﬁcantly boost employee engagement while instilling

a sense of ownership. To facilitate this process, leaders should

involve employees in decision-making, solicit their input on

implementation strategies, and delegate responsibilities accordingly

during a departmental transition. Leaders can drive innovation and

increase the chance of a successful outcome by leveraging the team’s

collective wisdom, rather than taking a top-down leadership approach.

By prioritizing their team’s psychological safety, leaders can create

an environment where team members feel empowered to take risks,

knowing it’s okay that not every decision will succeed.
