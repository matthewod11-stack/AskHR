Although these recalled instances may be "unforgettable." they niay not be remem- bered accurately, since most human beings are not blessed with total recall. Instead, these remembered samples of behavior may become distorted over time due to the frailties of human memory, they may also be colored and reinterpreted in the mind by incidents which have occurred during the intervening period of time.

Furthermore, the "unforgettable" incidents may not be typical of the ratee's day-to- day performance. While a spectacular success or failure during the year should certainly be considered when rating an employee's behavior, one or two "unforgettable" incidents should not overshadow the hundreds of instances of more typical behavior which have occurred during the rating period Otherwise, the ratings will be distorted; they will not be valid as true measures of typical behavior across the penod covered by the performance appraisal.

Since human memory is not infallible, how can raters be helped to recall accurately typical instances of behavior which occur across a span of time? The best approach is to keep records of observations as they occur, and to refer to these records when filling out the performance appraisal instrument. Three record-keeping approaches which have been devised to help raters are described in this section. These approaches are: (1) keeping a critical incident file, (2) keeping a diary, and (31 using a checklist.

In 1954, John Flanagan introduced a job analysis method which he called "the critical incident technique." 46 This method was quickly adapted for use in a perfor- mance appraisal context.41 The method calls for the observer to provide anecdotal descriptions of effective and ineffective job behaviors which have actually been observed in the work setting. These anecdotal observations, called "critical incidents," have been characterized as follows:

The observer reporting the critical incident is typically asked to describe: (1) what led up to the incident and the context in which it occurred, (2) exactly what the individual did that was effective or ineffective. (3) the apparent consequences of this behavior, and (4) whether or not the consequences were under the individual's contro1.5

Two examples of critical incidents, one positive and one negative, are piovided in
