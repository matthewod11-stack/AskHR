# Feminist Epistemology

Some feminist psychologists have explored epistemological and methodological alternatives to conventional ways of pro- ducing knowledge in psychology (Hare-Mustin & Marecek, 1990; Kimmel & Crawford, 2000; Morawski, 1994). Chief among them are redeﬁning objectivity; reﬂexively exploring the investigator’s subjectivity and social position; attention to power relations within the research process; and openness to methodological pluralism.

Redeﬁning Objectivity. Feminist commentary about science has called into question the notion of objectivity, that is, the possibility of knowledge uninﬂuenced by values (Harding, 1986). All of us necessarily perceive, think, and speak from a standpoint generated by our social location and experience. The scientiﬁc method does not prevent an inves- tigator from inﬂuencing the research process and its outcome. From the time of Helen Thompson Woolley to the present, feminists in psychology have questioned the assumption that facts and values could be separated. As feminist critics re- considered the research process, they uncovered the pro- found effects of researchers’ standpoints at every stage from formulating questions to designing studies to interpreting data (McHugh, Koeske, & Frieze, 1986).

Some feminists see knowledge production as a historical process embedded in the particular situations of the partici- pants in that process—the researchers and the researched. Research practices, procedures, and outcomes are situated in the social, political, economic, and ideological contexts of their time. Thus, investigations can yield only a particular, limited truth (Haraway, 1988). Jill Morawski (1994) offers a thoughtful reconceptualization of objectivity, subjectivity, and other constructs such as validity, reliability, and general- ization. Rather than denying that human values and perspec- tives inﬂuence the research process, many feminists strive to discern and acknowledge their standpoint. For example, they report who sponsors their research and who will beneﬁt from the ﬁndings (accountability), and they disclose their social position, politics, and values (partiality).

Exploring Reﬂexivity and Subjectivity. Some femi- nists have also advocated reﬂexivity (Wilkinson, 1988).
