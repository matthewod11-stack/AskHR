Stepping into a chief executive role is exhilarating. At the same time,

the reality of leading an organization hits diﬀerently when you’re

all want to know: Who are you as a leader? What’s going to change?

What’s your strategy? Where are you taking the organization? The

temptation to act quickly is real.
