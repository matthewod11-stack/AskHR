# Engaging Stakeholders

Real trust and alignment doesn’t happen by accident—it needs to be

intentionally built. A key task for new CEOs is to build relationships

with stakeholders including your employees, customers, shareholders,

# board members, analysts, and community.

Leading CEOs often start with a few critical priorities and form working

groups of inﬂuential voices—those culture carriers who can shape

opinions, rally teams, build trust, and ease concerns during change. By

engaging the right voices early, the best CEOs foster alignment and real

input, building momentum from within rather than relying solely on

# top-down direction.

As you’re building relationships with stakeholders, ask yourself:

# HBR / Digital Article / What New CEOs Should Ask Themselves in Their First 100 Days

- Who are the most important stakeholders based on where the

organization is going, not where it’s been?

- Do your stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the

organization’s priorities are?

- Who are the culture carriers in this organization? Are their voices

involved early enough to build alignment, not just communicate

# decisions?

- How are we measuring whether trust in leadership is growing or

# fading?

# Building Your Vision

New CEOs invariably will be asked dozens of times: What’s your

new strategy? In the ﬁrst few months, employees don’t expect a

new CEO to have all the details ﬁgured out, but they do want

clarity on direction. We’ve found that the most successful CEOs

articulate the big strategic questions the organization must address,

while simultaneously launching focused actions—for example, shifting

delivery to be more AI-driven, expanding into certain markets, or

creating enough room in the P&L to invest in growth. They use these

early, no regret, moves to signal where the organization is heading, even

as the vision and related strategic actions are still being developed.

These leaders also recognize that their teams want clarity of purpose—

why does the organization exist, and how, you, as a leader will create a

vision that will help to address these fundamental questions. As you’re

preparing to introduce your vision, ask yourself:

- What actions can we take now that will drive immediate impact for

where the organization is headed?

- Is the organization currently clear about how it creates value and the

big strategic questions that must be addressed?

# HBR / Digital Article / What New CEOs Should Ask Themselves in Their First 100 Days

- Who has the insight and foresight to shape the vision—and how fast

should we move to stay ahead?

- How are priorities being balanced to deliver results today while driving

# future growth?

# Staying Focused

New CEOs often ﬁnd themselves pulled in multiple directions, reacting

to problems instead of driving their own agenda. It’s easy to lose sight

of what matters most. Staying on course requires making time for your

own work and developing the conﬁdence and respect to help keep the

organization moving forward. To stay grounded and in control, CEOs

# should:

- Choose a few trusted advisors who speak openly and help them stay on

# course.

- Track and balance how much o
