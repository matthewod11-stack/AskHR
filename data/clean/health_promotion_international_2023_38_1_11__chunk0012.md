paper, we only focus on the social dimensions of work- place health and left out the analysis of occupational health and safety. Theoretical insights from theories of belonging helped us to get an in-depth understanding of the relevance of these social dimensions for health and well-being. Within this broader code ‘dimensions of belonging’ we identified patterns between and within sub-codes such as the role of social relations on perceived health at work, the role of recognition for local expertise and the participatory process of devel- oping workplace health activities. In this way, we are able to appreciate how different dimensions of belong- ing were produced and impacting how employees felt at work in both settings. In the following, we will dis- cussed the identified patterns, illustrated by exemplary quotes. The study obtained ethical clearance from the Ethics Review Committee Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (FMHL-REC) of Maastricht University, regis- tering code: FHML-REC/2019/BierThis.

RESULTS Physical/psychological dimensions of belonging and workplace health When we asked employees about ‘work and health’, many associated this with individual health and meas- ures, such as healthy food intake and physical activ- ity, thereby reproducing the individualized discourse on health. However, while spending time on the work floor, we observed and learned that daily workplace dynamics in relation to employees’ health were more nuanced.

Managing health together at the industrial production company Some employees at the industrial production company expressed their frustrations related to overall job satis- faction and the work atmosphere:

You need more than fruit alone; that’s not what people need. Better yet, you need to start on the other side: that people feel part of the company and that they find it normal to partake in parties and activities. (interview)

Referring to the company’s vitality programme, another employee remarked: ‘vitality is when the team members, among themselves, accommodate a colleague suffering from migraines’ (field notes). These quotes show that workplace health is seen as a social practice that relates to the feeling of being part of the company and of a team whose members help one another. We observed that the teams in the production shifts were close-knit groups, where colleagues knew about their private lives and peculiarities:
