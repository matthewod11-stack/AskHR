# Foreword

The History of Psychology is the most recent contribution in a long tradition of the presentation of an account of the im- portant historical developments and landmarks in the ﬁeld of psychology.

In the beginning, when there were only a few psycholo- gists (in 1892 the new American Psychological Association had 31 charter members), there were some who could rea- sonably be described as possessing the whole, or at least a signiﬁcant part, of psychology in their consciousness. How- ever, the ability to speak with authority on the whole of the ﬁeld of psychology is now no longer in the hands of any sin- gle person or source. (A vestigial remnant of this tradition of “universal psychological knowledge” is in the expectation that a doctoral student in psychology should be able to take, and pass, a “comprehensive” examination on the whole ﬁeld of psychology’s subject matter and methodology.) And, the tradition of the comprehensive history of the whole ﬁeld is also still with us in the vast textbooks that now introduce the area to so many undergraduates—some of which have almost a thousand pages!

But we must grant that the task is an impossible one and anyone who attempts to carry it out will face serious prob- lems. Someone smart enough to solve this problem is smart enough not to try. But, if being smart is not enough and we do decide to take on the task, who will be selected to undertake it and how will they be instructed to go about the actual work? What criteria of selection are in play? If your favorite topic is included, is something else that I really like going to be excluded?

Psychology’s history, even if conﬁned to the United States since 1879, is so large and so various that it is probably be- yond attempts to cover the whole ﬁeld in any comprehensive manner. Instead, the editor has wisely elected to sample the ﬁeld so that a description of the part will indicate the possi- bilities of the whole.

Can we justify the particular sample of psychology that the editor has arranged here? Since there is no objective stan- dard for inclusion or exclusion, we must honor the scholar- ship and integrity of the editor even if there is a nagging doubt: “How could the volume omit semiotics, or the activity of Raymond Dodge at Yale in 1924?” The solution is to fol-

low the advice of Aristotle who counseled the observer to suspend disbelief . . . and to get with it.

This author is an unindicted co-conspirator in an attempt to list and deﬁne the one hundred most important (central) concepts in general psychology. In the Dictionary of Con- cepts in General Psychology (Popplestone & McPherson, 1988), the publisher selected the number 100 (presumably for its commercial utility), but we coauthors were given com- plete freedom to compile the list and write the deﬁnitions. We decided that there was no really satisfactory way to deﬁne the 100 core concepts, so we charged ahead on our own using the indices of several introductory textbooks, the topics in annual reviews, similar informal sampling techniques, and our own intense conversations. There comes a time when one must bite the bullet and just do it, even though this leaves a wide target for the cheap shot of the reviewer who asks, “By what criteria were these concepts selected?” but does not offer a feasible and useful alternative.

Qualitative and quantitative judgments of relevance or im- pact, however carefully made and subsequently justified, cannot be utterly free of criticism and appraisal. In the vast extended ﬁeld of contemporary psychology there will always be differences of opinion about selection and emphasis— often advocated with great enthusiasm.

If psychology is too large and too variable to be totally in- clusive, then we have a similar problem in the selection of the observers. There is no one today who would be so bold as to present him- or herself as having a complete grasp of the whole of the field, to be able to present the kind of detailed, thoughtful history that the readers may reasonably expect.

The editor of the History of Psychology has found a solu- tion to these problems in the judicious sampling of the content areas and the careful selection of authors to write about them, while also allowing the authors the intellectual freedom to deal with the content as their experience and con- sideration allow.

History of Psychology is a unique volume. There is nothing quite like it available for the individual scholar or students, and so it ﬁlls a rather special and useful niche that would oth- erwise be vacant. Partly this is done by using a team of experts
