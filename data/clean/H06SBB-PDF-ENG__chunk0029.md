## about building worlds, whether that’s with a headset on or whether we

drive into the office to create that world.

ADI IGNATIUS: So we’re getting a few questions that are about

community, about culture, and I sense in these questions and in

my own experience that the flexibility, the agency that we want to

give people might clash with building a culture and sustaining a

culture that’s truly meaningful. Here’s one from Jerry from Woburn,

Massachusetts, asking how much culture do we lose in a remote or even

hybrid environment? Mary Jo from Portland, Oregon, is asking how we

increase the sense of community in the office?

There are a lot of questions about how we build back this culture. You

started to talk about it, but I’d love to hear more because we’re all

struggling with this right now and feeling that it’s a trade-off: agency is

good, but you might lose culture or you have to reinvent what culture
