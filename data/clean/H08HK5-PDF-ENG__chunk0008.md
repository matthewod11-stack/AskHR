## HBR / Digital Article / When Expressing Gratitude to Employees, Timing Matters

gratitude at work (a place where most of us spend nearly a third of

our lives), they are more likely to receive gratitude almost anywhere

else. Genuine gratitude at work is surprisingly rare, especially from

those in power, and when times are tough.

Despite this, the importance of expressing and receiving gratitude in

the workplace is evident, and some companies have endeavored to

cultivate a culture of gratitude. This has included eﬀorts like launching

Slack channels dedicated to #gratitude or #kudos, and other workplace

mechanisms to encourage inter-employee gratitude for helpful actions

that they’ve taken to further the goals of the business.

According to our research, however, thanking people after they engage

in their tasks does not provoke the same resilience and perseverance as

expressing gratitude before the task begins.

In our initial study, we set out to explore the emotions that employees

experience in high-stress work environments. After examining four

years of employee emails and then interviewing employees at a top

hospital’s ICUs, we found that many employees expressed gratitude

before a colleague took on a challenging task or shift, and that when

they did so it helped the colleague feel more socially connected and

purposeful—and be more resilient and persistent if problems arose.

To further explore the eﬀects of gratitude and its timing, we conducted

two follow-up experiments with U.S. online gig workers. In the ﬁrst,

331 participants were thanked either before or after working on an

unsolvable word-association puzzle. Those who were thanked before

the task reported greater feelings of social worth and willingness to

continue with additional tasks even after failure compared to the group

that was thanked after the experiment.
