# Fridays as well.

There’s no right or wrong here, and diﬀerent care arrangements work

for each family. The point, however, is to get away from being chained

to unrealistic standards and to start proactively managing toward

current needs. And no, getting adequate care doesn’t make you a bad

or negligent parent. It means that when you’re with your kids, you can

be with them — and not frazzled, ground down, and/or trying to do a

demanding job at the same time.

- 2. Seeing remote work as The Answer.

You worked at home for two-plus years and never missed a Zoom call,

much less a deadline. Now, your company is pushing for a return to

the oﬃce…and it feels as if you’re being asked to relinquish the single

precious tool that makes being a working parent possible.

New Move: Think as broadly and creatively as possible about the ﬂex arrangement that will work for you.

Remote work was a godsend during the pandemic, and it may still be

a powerful, core tool in your working-parent arsenal — but it’s not the

only one. If a key goal is to be available to your kids during evening

homework time, perhaps shifting your hours or working a compressed

schedule could do the trick instead. Or maybe other, more structural

changes are what’s really called for at this point in your life and career

— for example, a job-sharing arrangement could allow you two full days oﬀ per week. The more expansive your thinking, the more likely you are

to be able to craft the speciﬁc working-parent life you want.

- 3. Getting through today.

Schools were closed, work was endless, and the isolation was draining.

And to hoard what little energy you had left, you learned to take life one

day at a time. Goals? No — life was about getting through til 5 PM.
