# 2.1 PREREQUISITES

There are two important prerequisites that are required before a performance manage- ment system is implemented: (1) knowledge of the organization’s mission and strategic goals and (2) knowledge of the job in question.2 As described in detail in Chapter 3, knowledge of the organization’s mission and strategic goals is a result of strategic plan- ning (as also discussed in detail in Chapter 3, the strategic planning process may take place after the mission and vision statements are created; thus, there is a constant inter- play between mission and vision and strategic planning).

The cascading continues downward until each employee has a set of goals compatible with those of the organization.

Unfortunately, it is often the case that many organizational units are not in tune with the organization’s strategic direction. However, there seems to be a trend in the pos- itive direction. For example, a study including public sector organizations in Queensland, Australia, showed a fairly high level of strategic integration of the human resources (HR) function. Specifically, approximately 80% of the organizations that participated in the study were categorized as having achieved the highest level of strate- gic integration. This level is characterized by a dynamic and multifaceted linkage based on an “integrative relationship between people management and strategic management process.”3 Recall that an important objective of any performance management system is to enhance each employee’s contribution to the goals of the organization.
