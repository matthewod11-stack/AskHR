## of picosecond (one trillionth of a second) lasers for eye surgery. The

technology did not function properly. Because the pulses were too long,

they inﬂicted a lot of damage to eye tissues.

Juhasz immediately saw the potential of femtosecond lasers. As he

recalls: “Ron (Kurtz) gave a talk about his ﬁndings with femtosecond

laser pulses … showing that everything that was the problem

with picoseconds can be overcome using femtoseconds.” After the

conference, Mourou asked Juhasz to join his team. He also convinced

the University of Michigan, the NIH, and the NSF to provide additional

funding. Together with Kurtz, Juhasz founded the company that

launched the ﬁrst femtosecond laser for ophthalmology in 2001.

Juhasz recalls the early days of the startup: “People in the industry were

initially very skeptical that the concept would work.” But his persistence

paid oﬀ. In 2007, the business was sold to a medical optics company

for more than $ 800 million. Today, it belongs to Johnson & Johnson

Vision. And the story didn’t end there. After working on corrective

eye surgery, Kurtz and Juhasz developed a femtosecond laser-based

procedure for cataract surgery. More recently, Juhasz has created a new

startup that uses the same technology to treat glaucoma.
