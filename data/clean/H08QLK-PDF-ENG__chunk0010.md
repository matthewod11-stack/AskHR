## organizations as goal-oriented task environments. Rather than

beginning with a detailed map of every step in every workﬂow, it

starts with the job to be done, as Harvard’s Clay Christensen famously

urged, and then infers the requisite actions. Under the hood, AI ingests

signals—from a wide range of structured and unstructured data—and

dynamically stitches together the tasks needed to reach the objective.

There is no rigid choreography of screens and forms; instead, the system

continuously learns from exceptions, adapts its recommendations, and

orchestrates handoﬀs across functions without manual scripting. In

eﬀect, it transforms unstructured inputs into structured execution,

reducing the burden on users to know the workﬂow architecture and

freeing them to focus solely on desired outcomes.

In a CRM context, an AI-driven system would analyze signals—emails,

call transcripts, proposal revisions—and automatically update a lead’s

status. It would learn from historical outcomes to reﬁne the underlying

process, eliminating manual data entry and reducing process latency.
