## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 275

tious should prefer an environment that is conscientious. Others have noted that those with a positive self-image prefer environ- ments like their self-image and those with a negative self-image se- lect environments least like their self-image (Keon, Latack, & Wanous, 1982). Thus, low-self-esteem individuals may actually seek out poor ﬁt.

Touting the developmental value of poor personality-based PO ﬁt can be stretched only so far. Personality is stable in adulthood, so we should not expect individuals to change their dispositions after a bad-ﬁt experience. What can be changed is the ability to adapt (see the next section) and ways of coping with an incom- patible environment. As Schneider et al. (2000) have also pointed out, not only does the environment act on the person but the per- son acts on the environment. While someone may be unlikely to change his or her personality because of poor ﬁt, it is possible that the person might attempt to change the environment, with the consequences of such a change depending largely on the nature of the personality characteristic. For example, positive conse- quences would likely result for an organization from a poor-ﬁtting conscientious individual who raises standards of performance, whereas negative results might be expected for a company with a poor-ﬁtting supervisor high in neuroticism who has a negative ef- fect on the work of others. Moreover, the amount of change will likely depend on the power of the individual, with upper-level man- agers having a greater impact on the work environment than front- line employees. We encourage researchers to explore more thoroughly the factors that inﬂuence an individual’s decision to in- ﬂuence the work environment in situations of poor ﬁt.

In none of these cases are we suggesting that the individual will be more satisﬁed when there is a poor ﬁt. Instead, we propose that poor ﬁt is likely to lead to some kind of discomfort, which in turn might lead to development, self-awareness, better performance, or attention from others. The caveat is that the degree of misﬁt can- not be so extreme as to make the person withdraw or seek other employment.

Shifting the focus from the individual to the organization, we ask, “When is good PO ﬁt bad for the organization?” Schneider et al. (2000) do qualify the assertion that good ﬁt is bad for the or- ganization by noting that it may be bad for certain groups in the
