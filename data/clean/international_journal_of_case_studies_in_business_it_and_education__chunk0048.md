## The role of workplace culture in employee mental health

According to the study, good leadership can improve employee mental wellness and health. In particular, helpful, open, and respectful leaders can foster an environment at work that supports employee wellbeing. Yet, dictatorial, critical, and careless leaders can create a work climate that is toxic and detrimental to the mental health of their employees. The authors discovered that improved mental health outcomes for workers were connected with a healthy workplace culture, which is defined by pleasant social connections, encouraging leadership, and appreciation of employees' achievements.
