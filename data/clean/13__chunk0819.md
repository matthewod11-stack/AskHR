message, and without humor, some other communication or action channel might be chosen. Rather, an alternative to the (weakly) humorous jibe ‘‘you’re a model employee,’’ might be a more direct and upsetting statement like ‘‘you’re an irresponsible and lazy person,’’ or the more ﬂatly offensive ‘‘you’re an asshole.’’ Given these options, is it right to criticize humor for its destructive capabilities, or should it be praised for taking the razor’s edge off a very stern message? We hesitate to go so far as to suggest that all humor is positive. Humor might enable communicators to send negative messages that might never be sent otherwise. However, we believe that a more careful analysis of ‘negative humor’ might reveal that the negativity resides in the hearts of men rather than the comic tools they employ.

Positive Motivations and Humor Use Of the two broad categories, positive motivations for employing humor in organizations have clearly received the most attention (Rodrigues & Collinson, 1995). One major theme of positive motivations for employing humor can be described as a motivation to build a sense of cohesiveness (or ‘sense of community’ or ‘social integration’) between producers and the audience to humor (Haig, 1988). A number of different explanations for how humor builds or maintains cohesiveness have been proposed. For example, Meyer (1997) suggested that humor builds cohesiveness by emphasizing shared values, and Coughlin (2002) suggested that ‘‘gallows humor’’ promotes cohesiveness by recognizing the mutual experience of traumatic or stressful events. Another way that humor might be employed to increase cohesiveness is through its ability to help communicators ‘‘mask’’ unpleasant content in their messages (Holmes, 2000). Speciﬁcally, the humor producer can take advantage of the ambiguity inherent in determining whether or not a seemingly humorous and playful message delivered face-to-face was actually intended to be playful (Ullian, 1976). Along these lines, Fine and De Soucey (2005) note that ‘‘joking constitutes an established frame that rescues interactions from friction’’ (p. 9). For example, the humor producer can reduce potential negative reactions associated with delivering criticism, reprimands, or disagreement by communicating such messages under a thin guise of humor. More speciﬁc to supervisor–subordinate relationships, Duncan (1984) suggests that humor can mask the authoritarian character of orders delivered to subordinates. In so doing, supervisors reduce perceived threats to their subordinates’ sense of self-worth and autonomy.

Martineau’s (1972) theory of the social functions of humor is relevant here, because it suggests that the relationships between the producer, audience, and target or ‘‘butt’’ of humor are central for understanding
