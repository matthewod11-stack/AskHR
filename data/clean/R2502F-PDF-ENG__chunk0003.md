ces may encourage

unconscious stereotyping—that is, narrowly classifying and attributing

expected behaviors to others. This creates two risks:

Negative perceptions. Stereotypes may foster perceptions of cultural

superiority or inferiority, leading to a sense of entitlement or a lack

of empathy toward the other party. That can feed a rationalization for

# conﬂict.

Presumption of universality. Stereotyping disregards the individuality

and diversity present within any culture, which may blind negotiators

to opportunities for positive outcomes and learning from their

# counterparts.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

Another reason to focus on the individual rather than the culture in a

negotiation is the infeasibility of becoming an expert in the customs

and norms of all the geographies in which one might do business.

For example, an executive responsible for the EMEA region may have

morning negotiations with counterparts from Turkey and South Africa,

followed by lunch with her boss who is expatriated from South Korea,

then a meeting with executives from Ethiopia before closing a deal in

the late afternoon with UAE nationals. The agenda for the next day might involve an entirely diﬀerent set of nationalities. And even when

you are dealing with a single foreign country, teams may include people

# from multiple backgrounds and cultures.

All negotiations should begin with the question, “Does my counterpart want to work with me or against me?”

In such situations, it is nearly impossible to memorize and leverage

all the cultural dimensions relevant for each interaction. What’s more,

trying to be all things to all people only encourages your counterparts

to question your integrity. You will constantly be outside your comfort

zone, which makes you more vulnerable to ignorance, doubt, insecurity,

# and exploitation.

We believe that one key to a successful cross-cultural negotiation is, to

some extent, taking culture out of the equation. Business negotiators

often have much in common with their counterparts—maybe even

more than with their parents, partners, or children. After all, our

international counterparts may be closer to us in age, education level,

professional interests, the corporate world they operate in, or functional

expertise. For these reasons we advise negotiators in cross-cultural

settings to focus speciﬁcally on their counterparts, learning their own

A British negotiator from a London-based family oﬃce negotiating with a Japanese executive oﬀers an instructive example. Instead of assuming

that his counterpart would exhibit common Japanese cultural traits

## such as a preference for indirect communication, formality, or long

investments in relationship building, the British negotiator observed

how she actually behaved.

From the start, he saw that she was extremely friendly, shook his hand,

greeted him in English with a slight American accent, and explained

that she valued quick decision-making and innovation, having worked

at a tech startup in Silicon Valley for many years prior to creating her

own venture in Japan. She was candid, quick to share ideas, and clearly

signaled her intention to collaborate. Noticing those tr
