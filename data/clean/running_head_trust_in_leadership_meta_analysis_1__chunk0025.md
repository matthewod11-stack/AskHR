# leadership development practice.

Second, we assess whether trust in the leader as an underlying mechanism for the impact

of leadership is distinct from a broader assessment of the relationship between the leader and

follower. The quality of the relationship between a leader and follower is frequently

suggested to form an important mechanism through which leaders affect outcomes (e.g.,

Wang et al., 2005). We focus on Leader-Member Exchange (LMX), which represents the

quality of relationship between leaders and followers and can range on a continuum from

high to low quality (e.g., Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). Given that trust and LMX quality are

both grounded in principles of SET, addressing the possibility for overlap and redundancy is

warranted. Indeed, Liden and Maslyn (1998) questioned whether these two relational

constructs essentially capture the same thing. We offer an empirical test of this issue. Further,

in their review, Hughes et al. (2018) identified trust in the leader and LMX quality as the two
