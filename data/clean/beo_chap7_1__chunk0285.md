At bottom, the relationship to psychology has been a major feature distinguishing

organization theory from organizational economics. Roughly, one might say that many organizational theorists have been closer to the second approach described here, feeling obliged to take psychological (and social psychological) results on their

while economists have asked—and rightly se—how psychological results may be assimilated to the needs and theories of economics. In consequence, organization theory has far less formalized theoretical development than does organizational economics, though it addresses a broader array of significant issues.°9
