# interactions

It has been proposed that personal reputation is a difﬁcult to imitate asset that is acquired through social interaction. This is because personal reputation is developed in an environment of imperfect information, where individuals may use reputation to ‘‘signal’’ their intentions in a manner that suggests to the audience information that may or may not be known about the individual (Ferris & Judge, 1991; Spence, 1973, 1974). This ‘‘signaling’’ is based on the assessment individuals make of their environment, and it can be used to force an audience to reassess how an individual is viewed (Ravlin & Thomas, 2005). The motivation to send these signals has been addressed in the sociological view of reputation, suggesting that reputation is used to link people to speciﬁc identities. These identities are employed to acknowledge an individual’s attributes and status in the group (Elmer, 1984; Carroll et al., 2003). Individuals assess their status in an organization by comparing themselves with others around them (de Botton, 2004; Festinger, 1954). If this position is objectionable to them, they will attempt to change the image others have of them (Baumeister, 1982a) by sending out signals that are consistent with the group to which they aspire (Ravlin & Thomas, 2005).
