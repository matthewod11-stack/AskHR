Empirical paper based on university data

By scrutinizing social identity, social comparison, expectancy, social dominance and equity theories, the paper identifies a number of individual and organizational antecedents of individualsâ€™ perceptions of the gender pay gap.

By integrating social comparison theory and the gender socialization and organizational justice literature, the study examines whether the impact of pay inequity and perceptions of procedural justice on organizational commitment differs by gender.
