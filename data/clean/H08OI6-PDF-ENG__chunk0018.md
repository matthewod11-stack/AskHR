Remember that slow seasons can nurture growth. It’s not uncommon

to feel bored during certain periods at work, but don’t allow boredom

to become stagnation. Your career is the most personal and the most

valuable investment you’ll ever make. It’s up to you to be proactive

about how you seek out opportunities to learn, grow, and evolve. In fact,

slow seasons can be a precursor to something new and exhilarating—

whether that’s an idea, a revelation about what you need to do your

best work or what you want to explore next, or even just a deeper

understanding of who you are. It’s up to you to determine how you will

handle it, seize new challenges, and ﬁnd the silver lining.
