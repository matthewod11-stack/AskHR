specialized expertise, flexible capacity, credible validation, and anindependent perspective on complex problems.But while the demand remains, AI is undermining the traditionalmodel consulting firms use to fulfill it. This model depends onjunior consultants spending weeks on tasks such as gatheringdata, analyzing it, modeling scenarios, and crafting slides tosupport senior consultants-led recommendations. Today, AIsystems can do all of that, and more—and they do it faster, morecheaply, and, in many cases, better.For example, McKinsey’s proprietary AI assistant,

Lilli, is nowused by over 72% of its workforce, reducing research andsynthesis time by around 30%. The Boston Consulting Group is

using

Deckster, a tool that creates presentation decks in minutes,and Bain

has deployed

Sage, an AI copilot trained on its internalIP. Applications of agentic AI are also on the rise, with exampleslike

Deloitte’s Zora AI agents and PwC’s

agent OS platformreshaping internal workflows and client offerings. Across theboard, generative AI is

increasingly performing the work usuallyhandled by large teams of junior consultants.The work being automated isn’t trivial. It already includes tasksthat are the cornerstone of lower-level consulting roles and isencroaching on the tasks of the middle tier as well. If AI takes overwork that used to justify thousands of billable junior hours, thepyramid will collapse under its own weight.

In response, we propose that a new model is emerging: theconsulting obelisk. Unlike the traditional consulting pyramid,which depends on a wide base of junior consultants, the obeliskrepresents a tall, narrow model: fewer layers, smaller teams, and
