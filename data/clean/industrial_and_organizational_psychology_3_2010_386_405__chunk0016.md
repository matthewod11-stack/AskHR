thought provoking to IOOB researchers and practitioners. We therefore delib- erately do not provide an exhaustive overview of the JDM literature (for examples of more comprehensive reviews, albeit with diverse emphases, see Bazerman & Moore, 2008; Highhouse, 2001; Stevenson, Busemeyer, & Naylor, 1990). We do, how- ever, touch brieﬂy upon some topics that fall outside the realm of the traditional JDM literature (e.g., naturalistic and strate- gic decision making) because we believe relevance to them to be of particular IOOB. We have structured this overview on the basis of several themes—namely, judgments versus decisions, a focus on internal versus external validity, levels of analysis, applied implications, and philo- sophical approaches—collected from mul- tiple extant sources (e.g., Doherty, 2003; Maule & Svenson, 1993; Pliske & Klein, 2003; Solomon & Shields, 1995). The main message of this section is that decision- making researchers have studied a wide variety of topics relevant to IOOB; however, they have typically done so using different perspectives and methods than those used in mainstream IOOB.
