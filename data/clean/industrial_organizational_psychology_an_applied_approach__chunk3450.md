# advice for layoff victims:

. Immediately tell families. . Evaluate the reasons for the job loss. That is, was the loss inevitable due to problems with the organization, or could better performance, more current skills, or a better attitude have allowed the employee to keep his job?

. Deal with the emotions that accompany a layoff (e.g., anger, disbelief,

guilt, shame) and get help if necessary.

. Prepare for departure by doing such things as securing references,

negotiating a severance package, and taking advantage of outplacement opportunities.

. Take a vacation or a short rest period to help prepare for the journey
