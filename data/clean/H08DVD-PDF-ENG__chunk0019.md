# How to Humanize the Layoff Experience

Our data highlights some of the real costs that are incurred by

companies when layoﬀs are required, but it also helped us to identify

what you should be focused on if you do decide to go down that path.

Here are a few quick pointers:

- 1. Be realistic in your expectations and expect engagement and company conﬁdence to take a long-term hit. While you gain short-term ﬁnancial beneﬁts, you need to weigh this

against the challenge of rebuilding engagement and performance.

- 2. Focus on how the change is communicated from the outset.

Companies that are transparent and open fare better. No one wants to

be working in a constant state of uncertainty.

- 3. Don’t try to do more with less.

Recognize that employees are human, and after going through a diﬃcult change it’s unlikely they’ll be able to increase their output.

Instead, ruthlessly prioritize what work can be dropped so that everyone

can focus and rally around the most important things that need to get

done.
