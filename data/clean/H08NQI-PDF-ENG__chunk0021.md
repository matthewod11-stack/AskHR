JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently oﬀered a narrative more aligned with these goals in an interview with CNBC. The eﬃciency eﬀort “needs

to be done,” he said, adding it also needs to be reframed so it’s “not just

about the deﬁcit. It’s about building the right policies, procedures, and

the government we deserve.”

As Dimon suggests, the answer may be to make a persuasive case

that government gets better, not just smaller, on the other side of the

disruption. But this story has to be told credibly—and retold—for people

to believe it.

The Navy SEALs have a famous adage that “slow is smooth, and

smooth is fast.” We interpret this to mean, among other things, that

while reducing friction can take some extra time in the near term,

investments in good process ultimately yield a faster pace.

None of the steps on this list need to take a long time. Think weeks

not months. And in the long run, these eﬀorts increase speed and

decrease cost by reducing friction and the likelihood of rework, a word

that understates the stakes in the case of the U.S. government, charged

with such sober responsibilities as managing global health threats
