## THE FUTURE: NEW DIRECTIONS FOR DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE RESEARCH

The opportunities for future research to contribute to our understanding of job performance within the context of time are quite substantial. Yet, progress in this area will require both theoretical and methodological advances. Furthermore, the theoretical and it will be critical methodological research have a reciprocal relationship, using ﬁndings in one area to guide the next steps of research in the other. In this section, I will identify a number of areas for future research and speciﬁc research questions that need to be addressed to better understand the dynamic performance phenomenon.
