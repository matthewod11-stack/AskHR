# 330 Abnormal Psychology

By the 1940s, neuropsychological assessment of psy- chotic patients employed a range of tests for the assessment of brain damage (Benton & Howell, 1941). They largely fo- cused on cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and other components such as the subtests of general adult intelligence tests. The combination of neuropsychological tests, EEG and its derivatives, and clinical neurological examination provided the main tools for investigating brain psychopathology connections until well into the second half of the twentieth century. After that, new techniques of brain imaging were to revolutionize the strategies of research.
