Organizations need to be prepared for unexpected events such as death, illness, termination, resignations and promotions. Succession planning is a systematic approach which is ready for unexpected events.

2.2.2. Vacant positions due to baby boomers Retirements

The large number of baby boomers is creating a big risk for many organizations. These risks include loss of organizational knowledge, skills and experience. The number of potential retirees is growing due to baby boomers. When baby boomers start thinking about leaving the organization, there will be an urgent need to fill the position. Similarly, when baby boomers are heading into their retirement years, most organizations do not have a signed succession plan. Succession planning only ensures these replacements are prepared to be promoted in a shorter time (Ibarra, 2005).
