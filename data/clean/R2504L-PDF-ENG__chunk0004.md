## HBR / Magazine Article / Hybrid Still Isn’t Working

article is aimed at enterprises that want to keep remote or hybrid work

arrangements, at least for the time being.

Leaders of such companies must face this reality: You cannot eﬀectively

manage teams of remote or hybrid workers using the methods you

relied on when all employees were in the oﬃce together. Doing so

creates major problems for organizational culture, for how people are

managed day-to-day, for how they are promoted, and for performance

overall. Re-creating the cooperation and collaboration that happens in

the oﬃce in a virtual context requires new rules and policies—as well as

mandates that reel in some current practices.
