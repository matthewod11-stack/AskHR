## internal General Mills data from Microsoft Workplace Analytics). By the

end of July, average hours spent in collaboration had increased to 25.7

hours per week — an increase of 20%.

When the company combined this collaboration data with employee

experience data, they noticed that negative employee sentiment was

also increasing during this time. As a result, they were able to

understand and take corrective actions to keep stress and burnout from

continuing to accelerate.

to help support overall well-being and team dynamics. Each targeted

message focused on what a leader needs “to know” and quick tips on

what “to do” — with the focus rotating each week from taking care

of yourself, to taking care of others, to taking care of the business.
