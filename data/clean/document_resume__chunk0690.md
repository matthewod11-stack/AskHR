# Minimizing Rater Errors

The motivational effect of participation in the development of performance rating scales has been documented in the research literature.2-c:6 Raters are typically proud of the rating scales they develop through their own efforts and are motivated to use them effectively.

Rater participation in scale construction can also have a second major benefit, particularly when Patricia Smith and Lorne Kendall's "retranslation technique"--the process used to develop Bella\ Anchored Rating Scales (BARS)--is employed. William Sauser notes:

When employees work together to est:.iish a standardized set of performance levels and dimensions to ev aluate, they typically reach a common understand- ing of the meaning of each dimension and anchor point. Thus, the rater participation process serves to greatly reduce the problem of each rater inter- preting the scales differently.28

One problem with Smith and Kendall's retranslation process is that it

is very cumbersome and time-consuming. Fortunately, i shortcut method for constructing BARS has been devised .2`)'Â° The psychometric quality of the scales which have been produced using this shortcut technique is similar to that of scales developed with the unabridged method.

Participation in scale construction almost always leads to an improvement in rater motivation. However, the examples described above seem to indicate that the addi- tional benefit--creating a common understanding of the meaning of scale dimensions and anchor points accrues only when such participation is in the form of involvement in the "retranslation process." Flow can this additional benefit be obtained when work- ing with scales which are not of the BARS format?

This question has been answered by the dt % elopment of a type of training program, called "frame-of reference training," which involves raters not in the development of the scale, but rather in the interpretation of the scale.'1 An example of the practical application of frame-of-reference training is described below. In this particular exam- ple, the standardized instrument in use was a trait rating scale:

One possible modification with which I hav e been experimenting in my rater training workshops may prove to be % aluable. Workshop participants are asked to develop, in small task groups, meaningful definitions of each dimension of the standardized scale with which they ine working. Each task group also produces beim\ ioral anchors for each level of a pamcular standardized scale. After these definitions and anchors have been dev iced, the workshop convenes in full session, and each task pouf) presents its products. All workshops participants then seek to agree upon a common set of performance dimensions and standards.32
