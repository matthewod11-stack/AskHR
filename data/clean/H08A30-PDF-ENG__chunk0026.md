# of the assistive device only.

- The other conditions added some combination of the following:

- A letter of recommendation (either with or without reassurance that

the device itself is helpful and not problematic)

- An oﬀer to work for a trial period to demonstrate skills and ability

- A video of the candidate using the assistive device

Of these, it seemed that either the letter of recommendation (with

or without the extra language addressing the disability and assistive

device) or the oﬀer to work a trial period seemed to reduce bias. Neither

the pictures nor the video was reassuring on their own, and stacking

multiple extras at once did not lead to further gains. External support

and personal dedication seemed to be keys to unlocking a greater

appreciation for the candidate’s true potential.
