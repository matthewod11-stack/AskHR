## HBR / Magazine Article / Case Study: Do We Reskill or Replace Our Workforce?

“That’s why we’re framing this as a bargain,” Sarah said. “SolidTech

organizes the right training, which will help employees whether they

stay with us or not. In exchange, they commit to adapting.”

As the debate continued around him, Alex felt like a ghost himself,

trapped in limbo, unsure whether to move forward or back with the

Grand Bargain. In his gut, he knew that whatever decision he made

would deﬁne not just his leadership but SolidTech’s future.

Question: Should Alex push forward with a reskilling program?

HBR’s fictionalized case studies present problems faced by leaders in real companies and offer solutions from experts. This one is based on the HBS case study “AT&T, Retraining, and the Workforce of Tomorrow” (HBP Product 9-820-017) by William R. Kerr, Joseph B. Fuller, and Carl Kreitzberg.

A version of this article appeared in the July–August 2025 issue of Harvard Business Review.

William Kerr is the D’Arbeloﬀ Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.
