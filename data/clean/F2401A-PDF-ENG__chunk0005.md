## Claudio Fernández-Aráoz, a member of the research team.

The researchers analyzed all CEO transitions and subsequent

organizational results at 58 large U.S. and Canadian publicly owned

family ﬁrms—those with $1 billion or more in revenue at some point

from 2010 to 2018; family voting rights of at least 12.5%; and family

members serving as managers, shareholders, or directors. They also

looked at 1,406 S&P 1500 ﬁrms in the same industries and region.

Their analysis covered more than 3,000 transitions from 1994 to 2020.

It showed that in the three years after appointing a new CEO, the

family businesses improved their cash-ﬂow performance much more

than the others did—by a full percentage point more, on average. They

experienced signiﬁcantly less risk, with just 62% as much variability in

cash-ﬂow performance as nonfamily ﬁrms. And they had greater odds of

high performance and lower odds of poor performance, boosting their

ability to safely take on debt.

Drawing on the analysis and their combined decades of experience,

Fernández-Aráoz and his colleagues identiﬁed several factors driving

those ﬁrms’ success.
