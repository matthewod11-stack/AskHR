# better than traditional interviews.

To create merit-based systems, organizations must eliminate

socioeconomic bias, test tools for cultural neutrality, and ensure they’re

tools and promotion methodologies should predict the long-term job

performance across all populations. This includes populations that have

been traditionally excluded and that are therefore not represented in

the currently available data used for predictive modeling.
