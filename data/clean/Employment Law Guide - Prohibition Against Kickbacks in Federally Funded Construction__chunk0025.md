federal assistance is a loan guarantee.

The Copeland Act provisions pertaining to payroll deductions, the submission of weekly payroll reports, and

the method by which contractors and subcontractors must pay their employees apply to contracts in excess

of $2,000 for the construction, prosecution, repair, or completion of public buildings, public works, or works which are supported by the United States, including buildings or works for which the federal assistance

granted is in the form of loan guarantees or insurance.

A public building or public work is a building or work for whose construction, prosecution, completion, or
