Content Participants described the content of the training as pri- marily focused on “cultural norms and differences” (Nurse Practitioner, Physiotherapist).

Further education/training Most participants believed that cultural competence train- ing should be “regular” (Interpreter) and “mandatory” (Registered Nurse). More specifically, several participants suggested that training should involve “speakers from dif- ferent cultural backgrounds” (Hospital/Clinic Administra- tor). “It would be helpful to have training/discussions with people from different cultures/ethnic backgrounds who are willing to meet with health care staff in order to learn about their cultures/norms and how health care providers would be most effective in helping those clients” (Nurse Practitioner).

Three participants believed that their organization would be more culturally compe- tent if there was greater cultural diversity among staff members. “Increase the number of staff members of color and staff members who are multi-lingual” (Mental Health Professional). In contrast, two participants stated that cultural background was not the main priority when hiring new staff members. “I hire the best person for the job, not for their cultural background” (Hospital/Clinic Administrator).

Already competent Several participants believed that their respective organiza- tions were already meeting cultural competence principles. “My clinic provides excellent services and a willingness to diversify amongst multiple different cultures” (Medical
