Born six years after the U.S. Civil Rights Act hastened desegregation,

Brown became a debate champion and class president at her mostly

white high school. In her college applications she declared her intention

to be the ﬁrst Black female Supreme Court Justice. After earning

undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard and then working for

nearly three decades as a lawyer and a judge, in 2022 she made good on

that goal. Her new memoir is called Lovely One.
