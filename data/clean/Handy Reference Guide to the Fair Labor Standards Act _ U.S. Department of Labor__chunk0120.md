In accordance with the provisions of the SBREFA, the Small Business Administration established a National Small Business and

Agriculture Regulatory Ombudsman and 10 Regional Fairness Boards to receive comments from small entities about federal agency enforcement actions. The Ombudsman annually evaluates enforcement activities and rates each agency’s responsiveness to small

entities. Small entities wishing to comment on WHD enforcement activities may call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247), or write the O(cid:211)ice of the National Ombudsman, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, SW, MC2120, Washington, DC 20416-0005, or

visit the Ombudsman’s internet website, www.sba.gov/ombudsman/.

The right to file a comment with the Ombudsman is in addition to any other rights a small entity may have, including the right to

contest the assessment of a civil money penalty. Filing a comment with the Ombudsman neither extends the maximum time period for contesting the assessment of a penalty, nor takes the place of filing the response required to secure an administrative hearing

on a penalty. WHD does not consider filing of a comment with the Ombudsman as a factor in determining how to resolve issues raised during a compliance action.
