# HBR / Digital Article / Research: Women’s Complaints of Workplace Abuse Get Ignore…

In our forthcoming paper in Organization Science, we analyzed

thousands of workplace reports, combining archival data from U.S.

government employees with ﬁve experiments, to examine how reporter

gender shapes corrective action. We found that reports made by women

are less likely to be taken seriously than identical reports made by men.

This gap is widest when reports lack supporting evidence, something

our data show is especially common in workplace abuse cases.

In order for leaders to address the gendered biases that impact how

misconduct is handled, they need to understand why they occur. We

analyze our data to oﬀer insights and recommendations for companies

to help them build the kind of equitable systems that their employees

can trust.
