# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

variance explained in the outcome (e.g., trust in leader) that can be attributed to each

independent variable (i.e., leadership style). Relative weights analysis deals with the problem

caused by correlated predictors by using a variable transformation approach that takes into

account a variable’s contribution to an outcome by itself and in combination with other

predictor variables (see Johnson, 2000; Johnson & LeBreton, 2004; LeBreton & Tonidandel,

2008; Tonidandel & LeBreton, 2011, for a detailed discussion of relative weight analysis).

Relative weights analysis is commonplace within meta-analyses in the management field (see

Hoch et al., 2018; Kurtessis et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020). To conduct

relative weights analysis, we first produced a correlation matrix, which included meta-

analytic correlations between all study variables (where possible). Using this correlation

matrix, we conducted relative weights analyses, using Tonidandel and LeBreton’s (2011)
