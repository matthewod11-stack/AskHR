# conduct, and talent management.

Noticing the rise of employee activism, we decided to quantitatively

and qualitatively examine leadership responses to activist voices — why

particular choices were made and what happened in the aftermath.

As a result, we identiﬁed three key tools to help leaders make

more-thoughtful decisions rather than simply reacting and leaving

themselves open to the negative consequences of ill-considered claims

and commitments. These tools include a taxonomy to help you

understand your typical response to activism, an ACT IF framework

for choosing when to do or say something, and suggestions for how to

pause, pay closer attention to what’s happening in the world and what

your employees care about, and learn from your successes and failures.
