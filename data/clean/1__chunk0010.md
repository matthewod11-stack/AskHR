# Abstract

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing hiring processes through the use of automated tools, including resume screening algorithms, video interviews, and scalability. However, these technologies often fail individuals, who already face disproportionately high unemployment rates. Thi s results in potential non - compliance with the Americans with Disa bilities Act (ADA), which mandates equal opportunit ies and reasonable accommodations in employment. The opacity of AI algorithms, often described as a “black box,” exacerbates challenges in detecting and correcting bias. This study uses a systematic review methodology to analyze existing literature, case studies, and regulatory frameworks, evaluating the alignment of AI hiring systems with ADA standards. Insights from this approach inform recom mendations for accessible design principles, explainable AI (XAI) technologies, bias audits, and the importance of human oversight. These findings provide a roadmap for harmonizing innovation with inclusivity , advancing policy discussions to ensure fairness, transparency, and equity in employment for individuals with disabilities.
