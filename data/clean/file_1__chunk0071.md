# 2.2. Gender in/equality

Before switching from the discussion of gender to inequality, another the discussion of gender intensively researched topic in social science, it is essential to identify what equality itself means. Equality can be related to many different dimensions of people’s lives (Baker et al., 2004). It is ‘the belief that people should be as equal as possible in relation to the central conditions of their lives’ (Lynch and Baker, 2005: 1). In my understanding, equality is a state or condition where all individuals have equal opportunities.

In most countries people work at many levels in order to develop more equal societies. However, in most cases due to a resistance to structured reproduction of power and privilege, inequality occurs (Pease, 2010). It is a persistent attribute of our everyday lives. My understanding of inequality complies with the definition of Acker (2006a: 443) who stated that inequalities are ‘the systematic disparities between participants in power and control over goals, resources and outcomes, workplace decisions, such as how to organize work, opportunities for promotion and interesting work, security in employment and benefits, pay and other monetary rewards, respect and pleasures in work relations’.

Gender is not the only dimension of social relationships that causes inequality. Since we are so deeply diverse, equality in one space may lead to inequality in another one (Lombardo and Verloo, 2009; Sen, 1992). Although gender inequality overlaps with other inequality axes and various inequalities are often mutually constitutive, I focus only on gender inequality in this thesis.

Gender research can be viewed as a cluster of competing views on gender equality (Verloo inequality has been thus defined, conceptualized, and Lombardo, 2007). Gender approached, and studied differently. There is no agreement among politicians, practitioners and researchers on the definition of gender equality. As Holli (2003: 53) noted, ‘everybody supports gender equality because any one of us can give it the meaning we like’.

Although gender equality has become widely accepted as a political and societal goal over the last decades, as a concept, it is also changing over time. The concept of gender equality has shifted from the idea of similarity to the idea of equal worth, and from woman-centeredness
