## Relative Effects of Leadership Styles on Trust in the Leader

First and foremost, our findings support the belief that trust is a core mechanism through

which the impact of leadership behaviours can be realised. Our results provide evidence that

ethical, servant, authentic, abusive and empowering leadership all offer some incremental

effects on trust in the leader compared to transformational and contingent reward leadership

(see Table 5). Of these styles, servant leadership demonstrated the largest incremental effects

suggesting it offers unique effects for trust that extend beyond those captured by the full-

range model. One of the elements of servant leadership that is likely to distinguish it from

other styles is the emphasis placed not only on a leaders’ moral responsibility to the success

of the organisation, his or her subordinates, but also the organisation’s customers, and the

wider community (Lemoine et al., 2019). In other words, servant leadership’s distinctive

focus is on serving multiple stakeholders. Our findings suggest that this wider stakeholder

focus may be important for building trust with followers.
