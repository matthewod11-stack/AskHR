## most attractive brands in the world: the K-brands.

In 1994, a presidential advisory report noted that one single blockbuster

ﬁlm — Jurassic Park — had realized proﬁts equivalent to selling 1.5

million Hyundai cars. President Kim Young-sam decided to lead his

country on a massive transformation, moving away from the production

of functional mid-range goods, upon which South Korea had built its

competitive edge, to become a global cultural player.

Massive eﬀorts over the years saw the culture ministry’s budget grow

to US$6.05 billion in 2022, a third more than the equivalent ministry

in France (about US$4.6 billion in 2022). New governmental agencies

such as the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA) encouraged foreign

investments — Netﬂix alone announced a US$2.5 billion investment in

Korean content — and further boosted the country’s soft power.
