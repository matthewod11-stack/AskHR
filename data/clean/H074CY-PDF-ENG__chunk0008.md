## HBR / Digital Article / How to Conduct a Great Performance Review

These attitudes create a self-reinforcing dynamic. Managers do cursory

reviews that are really up or down compensation announcements,

not feedback. Employees then see the “appraisal” as non-existent or

unfair and approach the next review with that attitude. Busy managers

facing quarterly goals then try to avoid the unpleasantness and do even

more cursory, drive-by reviews, and a downward spiral continues that

promotes a culture of underperformance.

Some ﬁrms have stopped performance ratings entirely. As another

McKinsey study notes, however, when “organizations scrapped

the performance ratings, they found a need for a form of

annual documented administrative evaluation to make employment

decisions, such as promotions and raises. To address this need,

these organizations often implemented ‘ghost’ ratings—a system of

evaluation that is, ultimately, just another annual performance rating.”

In other words, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

In this article, I examine performance review best practices and attempt

to help managers reﬁne how the process is planned, conducted, and

repeated. Following these recommendations can improve employee

performance, while also giving managers a more eﬀective structure for how to have these sometimes diﬃcult, but necessary, conversations.
