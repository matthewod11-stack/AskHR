The internship is generally regarded as one of the most signiﬁcant experiences in the training of clinicians (Doll, 1920). The Training School at Vineland, an institution for persons with mental retardation, is considered the ﬁrst non- university institution to offer an internship, beginning in 1908. Routh (2000) identiﬁed 26 psychology internships that were established before 1946. According to Morrow’s (1946) personal communication from William Healy, psychology in- terns would stay “for at least a year, the tenures sometimes overlapping for considerable periods. These students en- gaged in psychometric examinations and in research and at- tended all staff meetings” (p. 168). What is of signiﬁcance about this description is that prior to 1946, training in psy- chotherapy for clinical psychologists was more the exception than the rule.
