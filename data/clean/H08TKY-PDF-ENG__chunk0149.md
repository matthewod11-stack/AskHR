# Fit,” by Rigby and First (2025)

. . .

Strategic failure: Strategy demands more than classic competitive

positioning. It requires making carefully coordinated choices about 1)

the opportunities to pursue; 2) the business model with the highest

potential to create value; 3) how to capture as much of that value as

possible; and 4) the implementation processes that help a ﬁrm adapt

activities and build capabilities that allow it to realize long-term value.

Neglecting any of those imperatives can derail a strategy, but CEOs

frequently zero in on just one. Entrepreneurs tend to focus on

identifying a golden opportunity and don’t think enough about how

to monetize it; leaders of incumbents, on capturing value but not

new ways to create it. By taking a holistic view and tackling all the

elements of strategy and integrating them well, however, ﬁrms will

greatly increase their odds of success.
