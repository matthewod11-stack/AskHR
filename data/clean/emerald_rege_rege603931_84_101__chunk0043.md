low average of 2.74 (minimum 1 and maximum 5), but this information separately does not enable the identification of the portion of responders that has intention to leave.

For a better comprehension and aiming to enable an accurate analysis, two groups of responders were formed from variable “turnover intention.” Group A is composed by responders that obtained average lower or equal to 2.5, it means that, according to the study, they demonstrated no intention to leave. And in the other extreme, the individuals in Group B had average higher or equal to 3.5, it means they demonstrated to have a considerable intention to leave the organization.

Therefore, it is assumed that in Group A 38 percent of responders do not have any intention to leave the organization. In other extreme, the Group B with 15 percent of responders indicates that they have a strong wish of leaving the organization. And the neutral responders represent 47 percent of the sample.

In the correlation between organizational commitment and turnover intention, the three dimensions of commitment are related with the turnover intention in a negative way, but with different intensities. The correlation between instrumental dimension and turnover intention is practically null (r¼0.08), that is, the results tend to indicate that this type of commitment is not associated with intention to leave the organization (Table VI).

The correlations, however, between the affective (r¼−0.46, pW0.01) and normative (r¼−0.32, pW0.01) dimensions with the turnover intention were negative and moderate. It is possible to find this correlation in comparison to the results in Table VII, under Group A (responders that have low turnover intention) and the Group B (responders that have high turnover intention). It is verified that there is a significant difference in percent of employees
