# Literature Review

Many authors have written about the nature of and different processes underly- ing the design thinking process (e.g., Liu, 1996; Owen, 2007; Stempfle & Badke- Schaube, 2002). We now present our review of the literature of this area, starting with a description of the nature of design thinking, its characteristics, and pro- cesses. Next, we present literature regarding expertise, expert versus novice design thinkers, and expertise in design. We then present our design thinking model adapted from Shute and Torres (2012). Finally, we discuss the findings from the literature, showing the importance of design thinking and providing suggestions for future research.
