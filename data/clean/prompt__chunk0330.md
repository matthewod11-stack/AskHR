# Output

- 3. **File Listing**:

- It lists all the (cid:450)les inside the speci(cid:450)ed folder using the `(cid:450)les=( “$folder_ name”/* )` command. This creates an array called `(cid:450)les` containing the paths to all the (cid:450)les in the folder.

- 4. **File Renaming**:

- It iterates through each (cid:450)le in the `(cid:450)les` array using a `for` loop. - For each (cid:450)le, it generates a new (cid:450)le name using the `new_(cid:450)le_ name=”dra(cid:454)_$(basename “$(cid:450)le”)” ` command. This new (cid:450)le name is created by pre(cid:450)xing the original (cid:450)le name with the string “dra(cid:454)_”. - It then renames the (cid:450)le using the `mv “$(cid:450)le” “$new_(cid:450)le_name”` command, which moves the (cid:450)le to the new (cid:450)le name.

- 5. **Success Message**:

- A(cid:454)er renaming all the (cid:450)les, it displays a success message (“Files renamed successfully.”) to indicate that the renaming operation was successful

Prompts for translating code

The bash code from Table 16 seems to work (cid:450)ne. However this script could really be reusable

when it would prompt me for (cid:450)le names, ideally it should work as a separate application with

an UI. As a sta(cid:457)ing point, Python would be a be(cid:459)er language for a (web) application than

Bash. LLMs can help with translating code from one language to another. See the example in
