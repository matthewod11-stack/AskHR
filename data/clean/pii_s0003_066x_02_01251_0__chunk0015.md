come, the quality of the American workforce will be a crucial determinant of America’s ability to compete and win in world markets.

Human resources can be sources of sustained com- petitive advantage as long as they meet three basic re- quirements: (a) They add positive economic benefits to the process of producing goods or delivering services; (b) the skills of the workforce are distinguishable from those of competitors (e.g., through education and workplace learning); and (c) such skills are not easily duplicated (Barney, 1991). Human resource systems (the set of in- terrelated processes designed to attract, develop, and maintain human resources) can either enhance or destroy this potential competitive advantage (Lado & Wilson, 1994).

Perhaps a quote attributed to Albert Einstein, the famous physicist, best captures the position of this article. After the first atomic reaction in 1942, Einstein remarked, “Everything has changed, except our way of thinking” (“Workplace of the Future,” 1993, p. 2). As psychology in general, and industrial and organizational psychology in particular, stands poised on the brink of the 2ist cen- tury, I believe that our greatest challenge will be to change the way we as a field think about organizations and their people. The first part of this article addressed some key changes in the world of work; the remainder identifies some pressing research questions that must be addressed if our science is to remain relevant to 21st-century or- ganizations.
