take feedback, listen actively, brainstorm, solve problems, and hold

themselves accountable. None of this just happens on its own. It’s hard

headquartered technology ﬁrm we worked with. After acquiring a

European competitor, it entered a prolonged period of integration,

during which a ﬁerce battle raged over who would become the

new regional CEO was left with a fragmented, angry top team that

somehow had to ﬁnd a way to meet high-growth expectations from

the corporate center. For the ﬁrst six months the members of the team

chased individual goals, struggled to make decisions, and increasingly

avoided one another.
