- 3. National Landscape of ADA Enforcement

3.1 ADA Enforcement Mechanisms at the Federal Level At the national level, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is mainly left in the hands of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) (Taylor, 2024). EEOC enforces Title I, which deals with discrimination issues at work, whereas the DOJ covers Titles II and III, which deal with discrimination in establishments and quarters, respectively. In this section, the author is concerned with Title I enforcement. By essence, ADA enforcement is a complaint-based process. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a victim can present a complaint to the EEOC within 180-300 days after the action and can do so 300 days after the act if the state has a larger number of days allowed (Taylor, 2024). The EEOC can then continue in several phases, which include an initial assessment, investigation, voluntary mediation, or legal redress. In case of evidence satisfactorily proving discrimination is established, EEOC can sue on behalf of a complainant, settle or give him/her a letter that indicates the right to sue, allowing the individual to sue the other party privately. EEOC also carries out systemic examinations of trends of discrimination that affect whole groups of employees, notably when grievances show that a great deal of non-compliance exists. Nevertheless, due to the shortage of funds and personnel, the agency takes high-impact cases first (Kozleski et al., 2023). Moreover, the Department of Labor takes its responsibility to the implementation of ADA through the Department of Labor Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) that tries to ensure that the federal contractors meet all the requirements set in the ADA, particularly the notion of reasonable accommodations and affirmative actions towards persons with disabilities. Although ADA gives broad legal protection, the ability to enforce on the federal level depends on administrative capability, citizen knowledge, and the skills of the disabled in getting lost in the sea of laws, which are complex and usually an overwhelming process to many. 3.2 Key Federal Cases and Precedents There have been some landmark federal cases over the years that have influenced the need to enforce the ADA and even clear the air regarding the extent of the protection available to individuals with disabilities in terms of being employed (Morgan, 2021). Such case laws have assisted in the determination of what is or is not a disability and the extent of what should be considered as a reasonable accommodation, as well as what the law requires of the employer. Sutton v. is one such case. The United Airlines ruling (1999), where the Supreme Court stated that all those individuals capable of correcting their impairments through corrective action (i.e., glasses) were not found to be disabled under the ADA. According to this strict understanding, the impact of the ADA was greatly restricted until it was replaced with the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008, which removed most of the restrictions, defined disability accordingly, and returned the ADA to the scope of its initial intent.
