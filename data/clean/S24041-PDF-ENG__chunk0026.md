## best-selling studies on the use of inﬂuence and power. However, in

the context of CEO successions, we prefer the inﬂuence framework

developed by Roger Harrison and David Berlew in the 1970s, because

it applies more readily to the dynamics of power and inﬂuence at the

top of large organizations. It describes several approaches useful to the

departing CEO, to the board, and especially to the new leader, each of

which applies to a diﬀerent kind of situation.

The ﬁrst approach, assertive persuasion, involves marshaling facts to

make a cogent, logical argument, such as “A plus B equals C. Therefore,

there’s no other reasonable option but for you to do what I’m asking.

The facts are irrefutable, and the logic is clear.” This style requires

being forceful and credible in expressing opinions about what must be

done and how best to proceed. But it will be more eﬀective if you also

make people recognize how their own interests will be served by the

suggested plans.
