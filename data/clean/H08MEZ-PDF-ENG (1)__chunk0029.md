## part of managing policy diﬀerences across states. Good communication

prevents confusion, builds trust, and ensures employees understand

how policies apply to them and aﬀect the company’s performance.

Best practices for communication include: training managers to explain

policy variations, using easy-to-access tools like intranet updates to

keep people informed, and hosting regular Q&A sessions to address

concerns or recent changes. A leading healthcare organization conducts

fostering consistent messaging across the company.

preparation. Companies should begin with these steps to help ensure

they are ready for the challenges ahead.
