## HBR / Digital Article / When You Oversell Your Abilities and It Backfires

him: “You have to convince them you’re better than you are.” He didn’t

get the scholarship.

Reframe the narrative.

If you’ve already set higher expectations than you can meet, instead of

admitting outright that past claims were exaggerated, you can subtly

shift the conversation toward a more grounded reality.

You might say something like, “I used to think I had a real talent for

[X], but the more I learn, the more I realize there’s so much more to

master,” or “I’ve had a lot of learning moments lately, and I see things

diﬀerently now.” This softens the retreat without making it seem like

you were being maliciously deceptive.

Own it with honesty (when appropriate).

In signiﬁcant relationships, this could actually build and repair

credibility rather than damage it. If the exaggeration is at risk of

backﬁring, or you suspect people are now questioning your ability, a

direct, accountable approach can be powerful: “You know, I’ve been

thinking about how I described my experience with [X], and I probably

made it sound more impressive than it really was. I got carried away,

but I want to be up front about what I actually believe I can do.” In

some cases, your relationships may not be strong enough to withstand

this degree of confession, but when warranted, this one is worth

considering.
