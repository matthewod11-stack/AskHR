- Conﬁrming evidence: The inclination to favor information that

conﬁrms what we already believe, like noticing and believing news

stories that align with our views.

- Availability: The propensity to over-weight information that’s more

“available” in memory due to being more recent, vivid, or emotionally

charged. For example, lottery ticket sales tend to increase after a big

win is announced.

- Framing: The fact that our decisions are profoundly aﬀected by how

the decision itself is laid out. For example, we’re generally more willing

to act to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.

All of these (and more) are aﬀecting how we approach the critical career

decisions we’re talking about.

One of my favorite mantras is “outsource what you’re bad at” — in

this case, that’s remaining objective. Outsource to people by discussing

your decision (and its parameters) with people you know will challenge

your assumptions and therefore counter your biases. Devil’s advocacy

is nothing new and may seem like a given, but particularly in tough

situations, we tend to retreat to the safety of discussing our ideas with

people we feel conﬁdent share our views. Look for someone who has no

vested interest in your ultimate decision, and remind them that they

can only help you by being completely honest.

Outsource to process by putting some structure around how you make

your decision. Career decisions are immensely complicated and high

stakes — trying to maintain your objectivity while tackling them head

on in their entirety is almost impossible. Instead, take a systematic

approach to break them down and outsmart them. For example, before

you start to think through it, lay out a roadmap of how you will evaluate
