# Essential AI Terminology

Tokens: The fundamental units of text that language models process, typically representing word fragments or individual characters (averaging about 4 characters per token in English).

Sampling: The probabilistic process by which an AI model selects its next output token from a distribution of possible choices, with parameters like temperature controlling the randomness of selections.

Pretraining: The initial phase of AI model development where the model learns general language understanding and capabilities from massive datasets before any specialized training occurs.

Fine-tuning: The process of further training a pre-trained model on specific datasets to enhance its performance for particular tasks or domains.

Supervised Learning: A training approach where the model learns from labeled examples, systematically mapping inputs to their correct outputs based on human-provided training data.

Preference Model: A component of modern AI systems that ranks potential outputs based on desired characteristics, helping align the modelâ€™s behavior with intended outcomes.

Reinforcement Learning: A training method where the model learns optimal behavior through a system of rewards and penalties, improving its performance through trial and error.
