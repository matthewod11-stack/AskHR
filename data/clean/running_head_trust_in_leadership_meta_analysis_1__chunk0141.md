# alongside trust and LMX.

In summary, our mediation findings suggest that both trust and LMX offer distinct

pathways and provide support for the view of them as unique mediating mechanisms. The

uniqueness observed in our analysis may be indicative of the differing extent to which these

two mediators are in fact capturing the SET process. While LMX is a popular

operationalisation of SET, it has been argued that LMX measures (e.g., LMX-7; Graen &

Uhl-Bien, 1995) suffer from a shortage of items which are explicitly ‘exchange’ based

(Bernerth et al., 2007). For LMX, the SET conceptualisation may be more diffuse, often

reflecting more role-making aspects of the relationship (Bernerth et al., 2007). Trust, and in

particular affective trust, may offer a more accurate, focused operationalisation of SET. More

generally, our mediation results underscore the value of testing multiple social-exchange
