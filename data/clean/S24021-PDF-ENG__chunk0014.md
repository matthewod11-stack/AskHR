## pursuit of market opportunities (demand) and the creation of the

capabilities and capacity needed to exploit those opportunities (supply).

To proactively manage that balance, companies need a growth strategy

that explicitly addresses three interrelated decisions: how fast to grow

(the target rate of growth); where to seek new sources of demand (the

direction of growth); and how to amass the ﬁnancial, human, and

organizational resources needed to grow (the method of growth).

Each of those decisions involves trade-oﬀs that must be considered
