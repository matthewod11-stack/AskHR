## Analyze the results of the assessment as well as your business context

and acquisition strategy to deﬁne the objectives for your cultural

integration. Will you aim to blend the cultures? Assimilate one into

the other? Retain the individual cultures? And what do you expect

the tension points to be, given the diﬀerences in cultural values?

For example, when organizations diverge in how they approach risk-

taking and innovation, this misalignment can have ramiﬁcations for

the company’s competitive edge well into the future. In one acquisition

we reviewed, a legacy company’s risk-averse approach to innovation

collided with the risk-taking attitude of an innovative company they

acquired, resulting in delays in developing cutting-edge technology that

was expected as part of the deal.
