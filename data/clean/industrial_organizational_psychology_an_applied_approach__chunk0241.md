# For the Student

I can’t imagine a career better than industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology; it has something for everyone. You can be a scientist, a detective, a lawyer, an adviser, a statistician, an inventor, a writer, a teacher, a mentor, a trainer, a high-stakes gambler, a motivator, a humanitarian, and an engineer—all at the same time. In no other ﬁ eld can you experience such challenging opportunities and have an excel- lent salary, along with the satisfaction of bettering the lives of others.

I wrote this book because there was a strong need for a text that would appeal directly to undergraduates without sacriﬁ cing scholarship. Our ﬁ eld is so exciting, yet the existing texts do not reﬂ ect that excitement. Th is book con- tains many real-world examples that illustrate important points; employment proﬁ les that demonstrate the wide variety of I/O career paths; humor to make your reading more enjoyable; and charts and tables that integrate and simplify such complicated issues as employment law, job satisfaction, work motivation, and leadership.

In writing this book, I tried to strike a balance between research, theory, and application. In addition to the fundamental theories and research in I/O psychol- ogy, you will ﬁ nd such practical applications as how to write a résumé, survive an employment interview, write a job description, create a performance appraisal instrument, and motivate employees.
