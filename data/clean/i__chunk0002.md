# Through a comprehensive literature review of academic books and journals, empirical

research, and industry reports, the essential skills, resources, and technologies required for

effective People Analytics implementation are identified. Additionally, the thesis explores

the application of predictive analytics in employee retention using a HR dataset. The analysis

employed a comparative approach, assessing the effectiveness of various analytical methods:

Logistics Regression, Regression Tree and Random Forest. Notably, Random Forest

emerged as the most effective method for handling the complexity associated with multiple

predictive variables. Ethical aspects and challenges associated with predictive PA are also

discussed in this thesis at the same time with recommendations for future study endeavor.
