# Customize and fine-tune your models

How Lowe’s improves product search

Enterprises seeing the most success from AI adoption are often the ones that invest time and resources in customizing and training their own AI models. OpenAI has invested heavily in our API to make it easier to customize and 4ne-tune models—whether as a self-service approach or using our tools and support6

We worked closely with Lowe’s, the Fortune 50 home improvement company, to improve the accuracy and relevance of their ecommerce search function. With thousands of suppliers, Lowe’s often has to work with incomplete or inconsistent product data.
