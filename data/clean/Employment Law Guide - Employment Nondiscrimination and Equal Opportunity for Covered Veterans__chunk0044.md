# Penalties/Sanctions

If a violation of VEVRAA is found a during compliance evaluation or complaint investigation, OFCCP will ask

the Federal contractor or subcontractor to enter into conciliation negotiations. If conciliation eﬀorts succeed,

the contractor will enter into a binding conciliation agreement with OFCCP that includes corrective action the contractor will take and may also include the submission of follow-up reports from the contractor, for a ﬁxed

period of time, to assure compliance. If conciliation eﬀorts fail, OFCCP may refer the matter to the Solicitor of

Labor with a recommendation for the institution of enforcement proceedings to enjoin the violations, to seek

appropriate relief, and to impose appropriate sanctions, or any combination of these outcomes.

If OFCCP ﬁles an administrative complaint, the matter will be referred to an Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ"), who hears the case and recommends a decision to the Department of Laborâ€™s Administrative Review Board (â€œBoardâ€). If the contractor, subcontractor, or OFCCP is dissatisﬁed with the ALJ's decision, they may appeal the decision to the Board. In both situations, the Board will then issue a ﬁnal agency decision.

Thereafter, either party may ﬁle a petition with the Board for further review by the Secretary. Where the

Secretary accepts review, the Boardâ€™s decision does not become ﬁnal unless and until the Secretary completes the review. If the Secretary does not accept review, the Boardâ€™s decision becomes ﬁnal.
