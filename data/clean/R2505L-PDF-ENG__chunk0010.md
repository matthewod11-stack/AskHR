## HBR / Magazine Article / How to Counter Fake News

an era where disinformation can spread with unprecedented speed and

reach, silence can be risky.

Second, asking news outlets and social media platforms to swiftly

remove or correct harmful content is an important ﬁrst step, but it is

insuﬃcient to staunch the ﬂow. Fake news often resurfaces through

screenshots, reposts, or alternative formats, making it nearly impossible

to contain its spread entirely.

Third and more frustrating still, correcting the record with facts does

little to change the narrative. For instance, when Wayfair faced baseless

accusations of child traﬃcking in 2020, the company’s clariﬁcations

failed to prevent the rumors from going viral and ultimately reaching

some 4.5 million people. And when the Arab airline Saudia faced false

accusations of segregating men and women on its ﬂights, company

spokespeople denied the claims in newspaper interviews. Despite their eﬀorts, the fake news took on a life of its own, sparking ongoing

online debates about Islamophobia, sexual harassment on airplanes,

and cultural misunderstandings—conversations that continued to

propagate the fake news story.
