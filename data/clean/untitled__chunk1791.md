# Preliminary Issues

proposed an inevitable progression in mental development of peoples through three major stages. The ﬁrst stage is the superstitious theological stage, which progresses through (1) animism (the belief that each object has its own will), (2) polytheism (the belief that demons, spirits, and deities im- pose themselves on objects), and (3) monotheism (the belief that one God imposes his will on all things).

In the second metaphysical stage it is believed that natural events are caused by occult physical forces. In the third sci- entiﬁc stage, positive knowledge of natural causes replaces superstition and metaphysics, and humans turn to the study of laws “of relations of succession and resemblances” in order to understand events in the natural world. It followed that primitive humans at the animistic stage of reasoning about the world would not react in the same way as civilized humans. Subsequently, interpretations of Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection published in 1859 reinforced the assumption that prehistoric peoples would have been too intellectually primitive to perform trepanation as a rational surgical technique.
