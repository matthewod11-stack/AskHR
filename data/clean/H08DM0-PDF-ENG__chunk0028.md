# Don’t:

- Roll your eyes or scoﬀ when you disagree with your boss. Instead, ask

open-ended questions to understand their reasoning and demonstrate

you’re open to collaboration.

- Complain or gossip about your boss with colleagues. Instead, discuss

decisions to gauge their perspective and stay positive.

- Hesitate to escalate concerns to other leaders if your boss’s hasty

decisions conﬂict with company values.
