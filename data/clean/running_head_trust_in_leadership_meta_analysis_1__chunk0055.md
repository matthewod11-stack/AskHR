# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

The relatively fragmented and inconclusive nature of the current literature means it is

not possible to make predictions as to which, if any, of the contemporary styles is the most

important for building trust in the leader. Thus, we take an explorative approach to address

this question. There are two related reasons for this. Firstly, as stated, each of the styles

included here potentially relates to trust. Take for example two seemingly distinct leadership

styles; empowering and ethical leadership. On the one hand, the delegation of responsibility

and provision of autonomy bestowed by an empowering leader may facilitate reciprocal trust.

At the same time, the role modelling and fairness inherent in ethical leadership should also

facilitate trust. There is no clarity yet as to which of these two ostensibly distinct styles offers

the strongest relationship with trust. In fact, compelling theoretical arguments, and empirical

evidence, exist for each of the styles included in our analysis. As leadership styles are

typically discussed in isolation, an a priori prediction of which style is the strongest predictor

of trust is problematic.

A second issue is that broader leadership styles often combine a set of different

dimensions e.g. the four dimensions of transformational leadership or the three dimensions of

paternalistic. While the conceptual core of the different styles may be different, in practice

these leadership constructs show overlap, particularly at the dimensional level. For example,

the empowering dimension of servant leadership (Liden et al., 2015) clearly overlaps with

empowering leadership. Such overlaps, common across many leadership styles, contribute to

the problem of making a priori predictions of which style would be most prominent for

engendering trust. As such, we propose the following two research questions:

Research question 1: What is the relative importance of the contemporary leadership

styles over transformational and transactional leadership in predicting trust in the leader?
