## HBR / Digital Article / Is It Time to Shake Up Your WFH Routine?

a deﬁned stop time so they worked later and then went to sleep later.

Others also ditched their exercise routine when they stopped going to

the gym at work and never regained momentum. And still others may

have traded the salad bar in the oﬃce cafeteria for DoorDash and found

that even their stretchy pants no longer ﬁt.

If this sounds a bit like you, it’s time to tweak your schedule to better

support your health needs. Some potential solutions include giving

yourself ﬁrmer start and end times so that you have time in the evening

to wind down and get to sleep at a decent hour. If you want more

ﬂexibility than a set schedule but also want to have clarity on when

you’ve “done enough” for the day, another approach is to count out work

blocks that you complete, aiming for eight or nine hour-long blocks.

Once you’ve put in your hours whether that puts you at 4 PM, 6 PM, or 8

PM, give yourself permission to stop guilt-free.

To begin to fold back in physical movement, you can start small. Some

of the people I work with will begin with even 10 minutes of exercise a

day that they can do from home. Apps like Sworkit can give you short

routines and you can ﬁnd a plethora of free videos on YouTube. Another

strategy is to do short ﬁve-minute walks as breaks instead of checking

your phone. It takes about the same amount of time and improves your

health and focus instead of detracting from them.

Finally, if you’ve struggled with nutrition since working from home, you

may need to incorporate in a time on the weekends or a week night

to pick up or order groceries. Most grocery stores do have premade

salads and quick meals that are less expensive and often healthier than

takeout. You can also pick up apples, bananas, baby carrots, and other

quick and easy snacks to encourage nutritious eating.
