# For safety reasons, Key-

stone RV in Goshen, Indi- ana, has a zero-tolerance

policy regarding drug abuse at its manufacturing plant. In 2005, the company received complaints from police that its employees were using drugs during breaks. To deal with the problem, Keystone closed the plant for a day to test its 125 employees and then fired the 28 who tested positive for drugs and the six who refused to be tested. Keystone transferred 20

employees from another facility to handle the new shortage of employees while it quickly filled the open positions from nearly 2,000 applicants who heard the news about the firings and wanted to work there. 7

The First Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that video surveillance is not an invasion of privacy because employees do not have an expectation of privacy while working in open areas (Vega-Rodriguez v. Puerto Rico Telephone, ). Furthermore, several district courts have ruled that organizations can monitor their employees’ email or search their computer files (Gary Leventhal v. Lawrence Knapek, ), especially when the employees have been told that monitoring is part of organizational policy (Leonard & France, ; Raynes, ). To be on safe legal ground, organizations should tell employees that they are being moni- tored and at the time of hire, get new employees to sign consent forms agreeing to be monitored.
