who become fathers want to share more equitably in caregiving, but

As your organization continues to navigate anti-DEI backlash, challenge

yourself and your leaders to look beyond the DEI status quo. Ensure that

as your language, initiatives, and strategies evolve, you are grounding

them in outcomes rather than intentions, debiasing systems rather than

“ﬁxing” individuals, creating broad coalitions rather than polarized

cliques, and communicating the win-win value of this work rather than

giving in to zero-sum narratives. Ensure that whatever you call the

work, you are building an organization for tomorrow that is better for

everyone in it than it is today.
