## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 143

the process. So, for example, Larsen et al. (2002) look at the me- diational processes (good) but then suggest that researchers should examine individual differences in these processes. We agree that there are likely to be individual differences in these media- tional processes, but we also believe that full, productive analysis will link these differences to existing and well-accepted personal- ity constructs (positive affectivity, negative affectivity, self-efﬁcacy, affect intensity, and others), not create new measures of individual differences in mediational constructs (the “tendency to see events as personally relevant”). Tying together existing constructs with mediational processes brings more information to the analysis, in- formation gleaned from the nomological network of the already existing variables. Dispositionalizing process does not do this to the same extent.

The other risk is the generation of a laundry list of disconnected personality ﬁndings, a natural outcome of the complexity of emo- tion processes. We understand this risk but at this point choose to accept it. Emotion processes are complex. Consequent dispositional contributions are also going to be complex. For the time being, this is the price to be paid for careful study of dispositional-process links. Our ﬁnal comment goes beyond issues of affect. Many out- comes of interest to I/O psychologists vary substantially over time. Dispositional explanations of these variables tend to focus on the same sort of aggregations characteristic of the research on affect. As with affect, the within-person variance goes unmodeled and is treated as error. Personality has a role in explaining the dynamic nature of these outcomes, but as we suggest, that role will be de- ﬁned by appropriate connections to mediational processes.
