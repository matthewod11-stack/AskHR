## 4,500 open-ended questions from negotiators — and the responses

they elicited. Our language models extracted both strategic information

disclosure (italicized) and emotional tone (bolded) from the responses.

We found that asking “Why” questions often elicited longer, more

detailed responses, revealing useful information but also leading

to more negative sentiment. In contrast, “How” questions tended

to generate positive sentiment but less detailed responses. “What”

questions fell in between, providing a balance between gathering

information and maintaining a neutral or positive tone.
