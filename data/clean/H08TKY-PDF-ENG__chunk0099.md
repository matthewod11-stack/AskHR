## Go deeper: “Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything,” by Steve Blank

(2013)

. . .

Lean strategy: The lean strategy process ensures that startups innovate

in a disciplined fashion so that they make the most of their limited

resources. This helps company builders choose viable opportunities,

stay focused, and align the entire organization.

The process begins with setting the venture’s vision, or ultimate

purpose—perhaps the only aspect of strategy that should be permanent.

To deliver on it, senior executives agree on a deliberate strategy,

deﬁning the ﬁrm’s objective (the near-term goal that describes success),

scope (what the ﬁrm will and will not do), and competitive advantage

(how it will win). The deliberate strategy sets the bounds within which

experiments will take place and guides daily decisions, but the results

of those experiments and decisions lead to learning that reshapes the

strategy. Though priorities evolve, at each point in time it’s clear to

everyone in the ﬁrm which ones take precedence.
