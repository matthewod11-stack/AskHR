ADI IGNATIUS: You’re talking about the office place. I think what

you’re saying implicitly is the office isn’t necessarily conducive to

working more efficiently. This is my view: that we’ve learned how to

do that pretty effectively from home, many of us, white collar workers

anyway, knowledge workers. So then the office is where we get together.

Maybe the office is where we do culture, almost different from work. Is

that what you’re thinking? That the office, it’s maybe not even a place

for work as much as it is for interaction?
