# additional rules.

The employer will not displace any similarly employed U.S. worker within 90 days before or after the date of ﬁling of any visa

petition supported by an LCA; The employer will not place any H-1B worker employed pursuant to the LCA at the worksite of another employer unless the

employer ﬁrst makes a bona ﬁde inquiry as to whether the other employer has displaced or intends to displace a similarly

employed U.S. worker within 90 days before or after the placement of the H-1B worker, and the employer applicant has no

contrary knowledge; and The employer, before petitioning for H-1B status for any alien worker pursuant to an H-1B LCA, took good faith steps to recruit

U.S. workers for the job for which the alien worker is sought, at wages at least equal to those oﬀered to the H-1B worker. Also,

the employer will oﬀer the job to any U.S. worker who applies and is equally or better qualiﬁed than the H-1B worker. This

attestation does not apply if the H-1B worker is a "priority worker" (see Section 203(b) (1) (A), (B), or (C) of the INA).

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 requires all recipients of Federal funds under Chapter 13 of the Federal Reserve Act or the Troubled Asset Relief Program of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that want to hire H-1B

workers to make the attestations required of an H-1B dependent employer that are listed above.
