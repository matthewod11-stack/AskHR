# Summary Points

- Performance management is a continu- ous process of identifying, measuring, and developing the performance of individuals and teams and aligning performance with the strategic goals of the organization.

- Although many organizations have systems labeled “performance manage- ment,” they usually are only perform- ance appraisal systems. Performance appraisal emphasizes the assessment of an employee’s strengths and weaknesses and does not include strategic business considerations. Also, performance appraisal systems usually do not include extensive and ongoing feedback that an employee can use to improve her per- formance in the future. Finally, perform- ance appraisal is a once-a-year event that is often driven by the HR department, whereas performance management is a year-round way of managing business that is driven by managers.

- Implementing a well-designed perform- ance management system has many advantages. From the perspective of employees, a good system increases motivation and self-esteem, helps improve performance, clarifies job tasks and duties, provides self-insight and development opportunities, and clarifies supervisors’ expectations. From the

perspective of managers, good systems allow them to gain insight into employ- ees’ activities and goals, allow for more fair and appropriate administrative actions, allow them to communicate organizational goals more clearly, let them differentiate good and poor per- formers, help drive organizational change, encourage voice behavior, and improve employee engagement. Finally, from the perspective of the HR function, a good system provides protection from litigation and can also help minimize employee misconduct which can have so many negative consequences for the organization.

- Poorly designed and implemented per- formance management systems can have disastrous consequences for all involved. For example, employees may quit, those who stay may be less moti- vated, and relationships (e.g., supervi- sor–subordinate) can suffer irreparable damage. Also, poorly designed systems can be biased, resulting in costly law- suits and wasted time and resources. In the end, low-quality or poorly imple- mented systems can be a source of enormous frustration and cynicism for all involved.
