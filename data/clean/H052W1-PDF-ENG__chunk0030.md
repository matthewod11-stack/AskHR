## HBR / Digital Article / How to Return to Work After Taking Parental Leave

As Courtney geared up to return from leave, she thought about what she

wanted to achieve in her new position. She also reﬂected on her identity

moments in the day to be a mom.” (She now also has a daughter.)

Still, she’s glad she tried to resume her old schedule because it helped

her recognize that, while it wouldn’t work over the long term, she still
