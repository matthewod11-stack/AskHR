## Methods Providing Information About Tools and Equipment

Job Components Inventory. To take advantage of the PAQ’s strengths while avoiding some of its problems, Banks, Jackson, Staﬀ ord, and Warr () developed the Job Components Inventory (JCI) for use in England. Th e JCI consists of more than  questions covering ﬁ ve major categories: tools and equipment, per- ceptual and physical requirements, mathematical requirements, communication requirements, and decision making and responsibility. It is the only job analysis method containing a detailed section on tools and equipment.

Published research on the JCI is not abundant. But it does appear to be a prom- ising technique, with research indicating that it is reliable (Banks & Miller, ), can diﬀ erentiate between jobs (Banks et al., ), can cluster jobs based on their similarity to one another (Staﬀ ord, Jackson, & Banks, ), and, unlike the PAQ, is aﬀ ected by the amount of information available to the analyst ( Surrette et al., ).

Methods Providing Information About the Work Environment Th e techniques discussed so far provide information about the activities that are performed and the equipment used to perform them. Th e job analyst still needs information about the conditions under which the activities are performed. For example, two employees might perform the task “delivers mail,” yet one might do it by carrying -pound mail bags in very hot weather while the other delivers mail by driving a golf cart through an air-conditioned warehouse. To obtain information about the work environment, a job analyst might use the AET, an acronym for “Arbeitswissenschaftliches Erhebungsverfahren zur Tatigkeitsanalyse” (try saying this three times!), which means “ergonomic job analysis procedure.” By ergonomic, we mean that the instrument is primarily concerned with the relationship between the worker and work objects. Devel- oped in Germany by Rohmert and Landau (), the AET is a -item, standardized questionnaire that analyzes a job along the dimensions shown in Table .. Sample items from the AET can be found in Table .. Although the AET appears to be a promising method for obtaining certain types of job analysis information, there has not been enough published research to draw any real conclusions.
