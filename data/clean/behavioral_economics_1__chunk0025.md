# (Goeree and Holt, 2001).

An alternative non-equilibrium approach, rooted in principles of limited cognition, assumes a “cognitive

hierarchy” (CH) in which more thoughtful players best-respond to their perceptions that others do less thinking

(Nagel, 1995; Stahl and Wilson, 1995; Costa-Gomes, Crawford, Broseta, 2001). These CH approaches are more

precise than Nash equilibrium because they always predicts a single statistical distribution of play, and are

generally more accurate than equilibrium in predicting behavior in one-shot games.

Before proceeding, note that the rational principles which are listed in Table 1 are normative. They

describe behavior of an idealized agent with unlimited cognitive resources and willpower. As we are beginning

to understand (e.g., Robson, 2001), it is unlikely that evolution would have sculpted us to satisfy these

principles for all important economic decisions. As a result, it is a scientific error in judgment to always

privilege normative principles in the search for the best descriptive principles across all decisions people make

10 The self-tuning approach is similar to Erev, Bereby-Meyer and Roth (1999)’s use of “payoff variability”; and Marcet and Nicoli (2003)’s theory of regime-shifts in response to hyperinflation. Self-tuning also creates shift in parameter values, as if players are switching rules throughout the game, akin to direct learning across rules (cf. Stahl, 2000, on “rule learning”).

(see also Starmer, 2004). Normative principles are, of course, useful in raising our children, teaching students,

judging welfare, and as limiting cases of how some people behave or learn to behave. Or normative principles

might be enforced by aggregation of decisions and market discipline, a crucial topic we consider next.
