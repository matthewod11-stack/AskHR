integrating these values, organizations can shift from a culture that

inadvertently promotes groupthink to one that sees diﬀerences as

opportunities for mutual learning. Within the team, the focus shifts

from individual winners and losers to everyone pulling together to

achieve shared success. This evolution allows organizations to move

beyond being dominated by the loudest voices towards a more balanced

approach that prioritizes the needs of the entire organization.

To do this, leaders should consistently emphasize the interdependence

of the team and the importance of every voice. One eﬀective strategy

being implemented in several technology companies includes requiring

all team members to write memos before meetings. This practice

ensures that all voices contribute, prevents language and cultural

diﬀerences from overshadowing who gets heard, and promotes the deep

thinking necessary for generating valuable ideas. This approach also

addresses the ineﬀectiveness of traditional brainstorming, which can

be particularly counterproductive when mismanagement of cultural

diﬀerences stiﬂes diverse voices.

Additionally, leaders have a crucial responsibility to overcome our

natural tendency to gravitate toward those similar to us. It is essential

for leaders to ensure that Asian employees and all team members

form the strong emotional bonds that are necessary for everyone to

contribute fully and eﬀectively. Leaders should consider increasing

one-on-one interactions with their Asian employees to foster these

connections, thereby facilitating eﬀective teamwork and individual
