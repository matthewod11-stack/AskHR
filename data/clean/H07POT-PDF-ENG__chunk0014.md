To be ﬁnancially ready, you don’t necessarily need to save a substantial

amount of money from each paycheck — start small and increase your

savings rate occasionally. For example, you might begin with socking

away 5% of your pay, then gradually increase that percentage. For your

emergency fund, consider investing the money in a high-yield savings

account, which oﬀers a signiﬁcantly higher interest rate or annual

percentage yield than a traditional savings account but is less volatile

than investing in the stock market.
