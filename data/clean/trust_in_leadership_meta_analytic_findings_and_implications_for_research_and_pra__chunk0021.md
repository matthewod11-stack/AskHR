Trust in leadership and satisfaction with leader are conceptually similar because they both reflect an attitude or assessment that individuals hold about the same referent: the leader. Given the similarity, we expect the two variables to covary at a high level with no distinct direction of causality.

The relationship between trust and LMX is particularly com- plex. Some research has conceptually or empirically separated LMX from trust in leadership (e.g., Cunningham & MacGregor, 2000; Lagace, 1987); other studies have treated it as a subdimen- sion of LMX (for a review, see Schriesheim et al., 1999). Brower, Schoorman, and Tan (2000) suggest that LMX comprises two trust constructs that do necessarily have to be “balanced” or recipro- cated: the leader’s trust in subordinate and the subordinate’s trust in leader. Given the complex relationship that remains a point of
