## Fundamental Principles of Occupational Health and Safety

The practice of OHS is guided by several fundamental principles that help create a safer and healthier work environment:

- 1. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment

Identifying workplace hazards is the first step in OHS. Hazards can be physical (e.g., machinery), chemical (e.g., toxic substances), biological (e.g., pathogens), ergonomic (e.g., poor workstation design), or psychosocial (e.g., workplace stress). Once identified, these hazards are assessed for their potential risks to workers.

- 2. Prevention and Control

After identifying hazards and assessing risks, the next step is to implement measures to prevent or control them. This may involve redesigning processes, providing protective equipment, implementing safety procedures, or conducting employee training. The goal is to eliminate or minimize risks as much as possible.
