# 3.2 Measures

PE and SE Scores. After the project’s conclusion, students participated i n PE and SE. They assessed their teammates and themselves using five criteria : communication, effort, leadership, creative ideas and friendliness. The sample questions are: “D oes s/he seem helpful and hard - working?”, “Is s/he nice, friendly, and positive?” The assessments used a five -point scale (1 = “poor” and 5 = “excellent”). Participants’ SE scores re dimensions for our research. Similarly, PE sc ores denote the average evaluation scores from all peers across all evaluated criteria.
