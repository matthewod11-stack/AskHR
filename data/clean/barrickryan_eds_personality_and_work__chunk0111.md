## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 19

instruments available in the marketplace. There is no Consumers Union for testing our tests.

One basic problem is that scientiﬁc goals may have become subjugated to commercial interests. To solve this problem, Gold- berg (1999, in press) has recently developed a public domain venue for conducting comparative research, the International Per- sonality Item Pool (IPIP). The IPIP is an international effort to de- velop and continually reﬁne a set of broad-bandwidth personality inventories, all of whose items are freely available and whose scales can be used for scientiﬁc and commercial purposes. Although no one investigator alone has access to many diverse criterion settings, the international scientiﬁc community has such access, and the IPIP provides a venue for pooling their ﬁndings.

Because the IPIP is an open system for the accumulation of new personality measures, all we can provide here is a snapshot of its current status. Included at the IPIP Web site (http://ipip.ori.org/) are 280 personality scales, each developed from subsets of the 1,956 items now available in the pool. All of the IPIP items are in a common format, one that should elicit relatively faithful transla- tions across diverse languages. The scales are intended to measure the constructs included in various lexical models, plus constructs similar to those included in each of six commercial personality in- ventories (NEO-PI-R, 16PF, CPI, HPI, MPQ, TCI) already men- tioned in this chapter, in two other inventories—the revised Jackson Personality Inventory (Jackson, 1994) and the new Six Fac- tor Personality Questionnaire (Jackson, Paunonen, & Tremblay, 2000)—and in eighteen other popular personality scales. (For fur- ther information about this ever expanding resource, see Gold- berg, 1999, in press, and the IPIP Web site.)

There are many competing structural models of personality at- tributes at the middle hierarchical level. Indeed, it appears that the more speciﬁc is the level of constructs examined in these models, the more structural chaos is found, and the higher is the potential for confusion among researchers who are not committed to a sin- gle inventory. In some respects, this situation reﬂects a longstand- ing pattern in personality psychology: each expert has his or her own distinct personality theory, and each theory is accorded its own chapter in personality textbooks, with little empirical competition
