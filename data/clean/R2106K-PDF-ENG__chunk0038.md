# FOCUS ON SERVING OTHERS

Companies can also institutionalize a preemptive type of moral reﬂection—what the psychologist Gary Klein calls a premortem (see “Performing a Project Premortem,” HBR, September 2007). Key decision-makers meet before a project to think through ways in which it could lead to ethical lapses. Consider the experience of a young strategy consultant working in-house for a large health care system. During his ﬁrst year on the job he identiﬁed an opportunity for the system to legally sell anonymized utilization data on a secure third-party marketplace. His colleagues commended him for the idea, but in keeping with the organization’s standard practice, the key decision- makers held a two- to three-hour premortem to ensure that the proposed initiative was ethical and aligned with the organization’s values.

Building a truly ethical culture involves more than just helping people to avoid doing bad things; it also requires empowering them to do good things. Research has shown that serving other people can reduce self-focus and raise awareness of moral concerns. It also contributes to psychological ﬂourishing; studies have demonstrated a link between volunteer service and improved mood and well-being.

Universities often provide students with service-learning

opportunities, such as consulting projects with nonproﬁt organizations, to help them gain practical skills while making a positive diﬀerence in the world and, it is hoped, becoming committed to service along the way. Research ﬁnds that such programs have a spillover eﬀect on moral character. In one study undergraduate students who partic- ipated in a summer service-learning project outperformed their peers on a moral-reasoning assessment.

At the start of the meeting, all participants were asked to identify their strategic goals around the initiative and to reﬂect on how their own agendas might bias their perspec- tive. For example, those representing the organization’s ﬁnancial interests might be motivated to overlook any

Companies can likewise provide opportunities to serve—

something Salesforce has done since its founding, in 1999. Each year employees receive seven paid days oﬀ for volun- teer work in their communities. They are also encouraged
