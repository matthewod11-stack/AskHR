These four activities are what real managers do. They include some of the classic notions of Fayol (the traditional management activities) as well as the more recent views of Mintzberg (the commun ation activities) and Kotter (the networking activities) As a whole, however, especially with the inclusion of human resource management activities, this view of real managersâ€™ activities is more comprehensive than previous sets of managertal work.
