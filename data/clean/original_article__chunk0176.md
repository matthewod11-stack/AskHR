enhanced by TIQ, is diminishing the positive impact that team dynamic and TP have on the board’s ability to generate positive proﬁtability results. Given the ever-increasing complexity in the governance compliance arena (Sarbanes- Oxley in 2002, Dodd-Frank in 2010), 50 per cent of directors report that they spend at least 60 per cent more time on compliance issues than they did in the previous year (Cloyd et al 2012). It is not surprising that devoting so much time and attention to regulation compliance detracts from directors’ ability to spend meaningful time on value-creating activities such as strategy development, succession planning, understanding the business operations better, developing human capital and risk management (Cloyd et al 2012; Charas and Perelli, 2013). Focusing on compli- ance issues required by legislation at the expense of other board activities and the negative impact on ﬁrm performance has been highlighted in past research (Romano, 2005a, 2005b; Shadab, 2008). In addition to the negative impact compliance has on proﬁtability perfor- mance, qualiﬁed professionals who once wel- comed the opportunity to join boards no longer accept board positions as they are loathe to take on the additional accountability of regulatory compliance as well as the reputational risk of being associated with a non-complying board (Lorsch, 2012; Spencer Stewart, 2010). Our recommendation is should consider improving the dynamic of the board- room to make their limited time together more effective, freeing up time to address strategic (less administratively oriented) and value-creat- ing topics. In addition, boards may want to consider availing themselves of advisors well versed in compliance issues, and charging that individual or (committee) with the overall responsibility for board compliance.
