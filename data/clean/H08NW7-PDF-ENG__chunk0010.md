Increased stress and anxiety

Keeping up a facade requires constant eﬀort and can lead to signiﬁcant

stress and anxiety. The fear of being exposed or failing to meet the

expectations you’ve set can take a toll on your mental and emotional

well-being, along with the emotional stress you cause others you’ve

coopted into your hallucination.
