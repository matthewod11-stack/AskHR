# HBR / Digital Article / Research: Are You Penalizing Your Best Employees for Unplugg…

Employers have responded by promoting wellness programs

and encouraging work-life balance—initiatives proven to increase

productivity, reduce turnover, and boost job satisfaction. But our

research reveals a hidden contradiction at the heart of these eﬀorts:

While companies say they want employees to unplug, they may be

quietly punishing those who actually do.

In new research, published in Organizational Behavior and Human

Decision Processes, we found that even when leaders recognized that

detaching from work boosts employee well-being and improves job

performance, they still penalized employees who engaged in these

behaviors when they were up for a promotion or being considered

for a new role. This is because these workers were seen as less

committed than those who worked around the clock, even if their job

performance during working hours was perceived to be higher than

their “committed” counterparts.

But we also found that there are structural changes organizations can

make to help protect workers’ boundaries without also penalizing them:

creating a culture that both mitigates burnout and rewards strong work.
