# The Research

Across 16 studies with 7,800 of participants, we explored a simple

question: How are employees who try to switch oﬀ from work during

non-work hours perceived?

In controlled experiments, we presented managers with proﬁles of

employees who were identical in quality (i.e., past annual evaluations)

but varied in their use of detachment strategies. For example, one employee left an out-of-oﬃce reply during a weekend getaway while

the other employee did not.
