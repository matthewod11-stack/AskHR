The transition from newsletter to journal was not always smooth. “The Clinical Psychologist” had carried book reviews, but none of the APAjournals did. All APA-published reviews were in Contemporary Psychology. The PP editor believed it important to retain reviews for both the conve- nience of the readership and the clear fact that few practice- type publications would be reviewed in CP. After much discussion, the review section was allowed in the new jour- nal, a major exception by the APA Publications and Commu- nications Board (P&C Board).

Another conﬂict emerged over the size of the publication, as the APA Journals Ofﬁce wanted it to be in the standard 7-by-10-inch format then instituted for all other APA journals (except the American Psychologist, which was larger). The newsletter had been in a 6-by-9-inch format, and the PP editor believed that its successor should retain its distinct (and convenient) size, in part to distinguish it from the scientiﬁc journals. With the editor threatening to withdraw from the publication, the smaller format prevailed—at least for the seven-year term of the editor. After a year of being in experimental status, and submissions growing monthly, the quarterly was made an “ofﬁcial” APA publication—and the editor allowed to serve on the Council of Editors.

In 1983, the title of the journal expanded to Professional Psychology: Research and Practice. PP is currently pub- lished six times a year. During the editorial term of Patrick H. DeLeon (1995–2000), with Gary R. VandenBos serving as the managing editor, Professional Psychology made an even greater effort to address the interests of the practice commu- nity.
