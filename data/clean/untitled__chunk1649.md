# EVALUATING INTELLECTUALABILITY

The history of intellectual assessment can be traced sequen- tially through Ô¨Åve developments: the emergence of the Binet scales, the construction of group-administered tests, the evo- lution of the Wechsler scales, the appearance of the Kaufman scales, and the quest for brief methods of measuring intelli- gence. The sections that follow discuss each of these instru- ments and describe surveys concerning the frequency with which these and other tests are used.
