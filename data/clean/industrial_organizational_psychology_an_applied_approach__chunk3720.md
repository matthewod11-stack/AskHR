My entire career has

been in human resources; however, a

few years ago, I ventured out and created a new corporation called Time Savers, Inc. Time Savers is a concierge/errand service. I made the decision to start this company in response to a growing need to provide people with one of the hottest commodities around: time. I was constantly seeing over- worked, stressed employees who never appeared to have time to get everything done, myself included. Many days I dreamed of having a personal assistant who could take care of things like picking up my dry cleaning which had been at the cleaners for weeks, or getting the birthday gift that needed to be shipped out

the same day. Now I do these things for others.

According to a recent study by the Families and Work Insti- tute, employees are spending an average of 44 hours per week on the job, and 45% of workers have daily family responsi- bilities to go home to. Seventy- eight percent of married workers have spouses who are also employed. So what does everyone do on his or her days off? Relax? No, they run errands. Employers also find that many employees are spending company time to complete personal business. With no time for leisure, stress is abundant. Busy people need more time to release tension, and concierge/ errand services can help them do just that. We can take away a great many of those “to do” items of busy people and give them back some time to do the important things like being with their families, exercising, or just going out to dinner with friends.

The concierge idea has been around for a long time in the hotel industry. Recently, it has begun to emerge in the corporate world and the private sector. I started thinking about the idea of starting this business after

visiting a local company that had an in-house concierge service for its employees. I was very impressed with this concept. Companies today are looking for ways to attract and retain good employees. Con- cierge services are starting to show up on the list of company benefits. I wanted to be a part of this up-and-coming trend. So what did it take for me

to get this company off the ground? The first thing I had to do was research. Was this a viable business? Many hours were spent on the Internet, reading books, speaking with others who had existing con- cierge businesses, talking to my attorney, conferring with my accountant, and asking my friends and acquaintances their thoughts on using concierge services. The results were positive, so I decided to take the chance.

The next several months were spent going through the process of incorporating, devel- oping a business plan, creating a logo, getting my office ready, getting special permits, deciding on a pricing strategy, identifying my target market, and drafting my brochures and advertisements. Finally, I was ready to advertise.

My first customer came within the first month. I was ecstatic. She was a single executive who commuted to another state. I was asked to do a variety of errands, rang- ing from standing in line at the Division of Motor Vehicles to dropping off dry cleaning, picking up contact lenses, and shopping for personal items. This customer has become a regular client. Other clients followed. I have retrieved mail, shopped for groceries, identified vendors, and taken items for repair, among other services. The time that I am not

spending fulfilling client requests, I am creating market- ing materials, making sales contacts, handling the finances, and making plans for the future. I have learned more in the past few months about business than I have in my entire career.

It’s very rewarding knowing that I am in some way helping my clients live a more satisfying life. The sky’s the limit for my clients, and so are the possibili- ties for the business. The best advice I can offer is to look for a career in which you can do the things you most enjoy; there are so many opportunities out there that you should never be stuck with a job you don’t like.

periods. As shown in Table ., the amount of paid time off varies across organi- zations, and some organizations do not provide any paid vacation days for hourly employees. In contrast to the United States, where organizations are not legally mandated to provide paid vacations, many countries do. For example, the legal minimum number of vacation days is  in Austria, Sweden, Spain, and France,  in Australia, Ireland, Italy, and the UK, and  in Canada and Japan.
