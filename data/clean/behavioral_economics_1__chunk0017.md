5 Denote the reference point by r (which may be probabilistic). Koszegi and Rabin assume utility depends on a combination of absolute outcomes, m(x) and a function µ(m(x)-m(r)) which is reference-dependent, depending on the difference m(x)-m(r)) between consumption utility and the reference utility. When goods have deterministic utility and the reference point is the same as the bundle chosen, then x=r so the second term disappears, and the model reduces to standard consumer theory. 6 List (2003) finds that experienced sports-card dealers do not exhibit an “endowment effect” (while novice traders do). A natural interpretation is that dealers do not expect to hold on to goods they receive. Since their reference point does not include the goods, they do not feel less of a loss when selling them. Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1990:1328) clearly anticipated this effect of experience, noting that "there are some cases in which no endowment effect would be expected, such as when goods are purchased for resale rather than for utilization."

Choice over risk: Many applications in economics require a specification of preferences over gambles

which have probabilistic risk, when probabilities may be subjective and when costs and benefits are spread over

time. Independence axioms assume that people implicitly cancel common outcomes of equal probability in

comparing risky choices (contrary to gestalt principles of perception, which resist cancellation), which leads

mathematically to expected utility (EU) and subjective expected utility.

In contrast to EU, prospect theory assumes reference-dependence and diminishing psychophysical

sensitivity, which together imply a “reflection” of risk preferences around the reference point (i.e., ,since the

hedonic sensation of loss magnitude is decreasing at the margin, the utility function for loss is convex). Many

other non-EU theories have been proposed and studied (Starmer, 2000), but prospect theory is more clearly

rooted in psychology than most other theories, which are generally based on ingenious ways of weakening the

independence axiom. Prospect theory also survives well in careful empirical comparisons among many theories

aggregating many different studies, and adjusting for degrees of freedom (Harless and Camerer, 1994; cf. Hey
