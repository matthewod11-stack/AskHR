# and Orme, 1994).

The other components of prospect theory are disproportionate disutility for losses (compared to equal-

sized gains)- “loss-aversion”—and nonlinear sensitivity to probability, probably due to nonlinearity in attention

to low probabilities (e.g. Prelec, 1998).7 Coefficients of loss-aversion8 λ—the ratio of marginal loss to gain

utilities around zero—have been estimated from a wide variety of data to fall in a range around 2 (see Table 2).

The striking feature of the table is that the studies cover such a wide range of types of data and levels of
