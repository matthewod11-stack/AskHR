# DON’T LEAN

Contemplating, being still, visualizing, breathing

- When team members need to work something out on their own and your presence may be an intrusion or slow their progress

- When the team is frenetic and needs a break or a time-out to calm things down

- When the team needs to step into planning or action mode

- When a crisis hits and people are looking to you for guidance

Whatever stance you adopt, be aware that you can use it with varying

levels of intensity. For instance, a Lean In comment can be a directive

or a suggestion, and you can Lean Back with a deep dive on an issue

or a more surgical set of questions. Your choice of framing should

be dependent on what will work best for the other person given the

situation at hand. As you work to improve your ability to use each

stance, it’s best to calibrate your behavior according to your comfort

level. If Leaning In is uncomfortable, for instance, push yourself to

communicate one more thing than you might otherwise. If you don’t

Lean Back enough, try asking a question instead of making a statement.
