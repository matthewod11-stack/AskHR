## more positivity at the mid-point, or end of year, or leaders who

were primarily negative at the outset). This remained true even after

controlling for factors like past performance or tenure in the ﬁrm.

To examine why early positive emotions played such a strong role in

performance, we conducted a second study with 245 student-athletes

and their 86 coaches on 20 N.C.A.A. Division 1 sports teams over the

course of a season. We used multiple, time-lagged surveys to capture the

degree to which team members received positive or negative emotional expressions from their coaching staﬀs over the course of the season

and how it related to team members’ sense of worth and individual performance (as measured by coaching staﬀ evaluations).

We found similar results: athletes whose coaches showed highly

positive emotions during the preseason performed better than other

athletes, even when controlling for things like playing time or previous

performance. We found that this is because when leaders expressed

positivity during the early time period, team members felt more highly

respected and desired to maintain that respect throughout the year,

thus motivating stronger performance.
