# Brief History of I/O Psychology

Considering that the field of psychology itself has been around for only a relatively short time (since ), it is not surprising that I/O psychology has a correspondingly short history. Although various experts disagree about the precise beginning of I/O psychology (Table .), it is generally thought to have started either in  when Walter Dill Scott wrote The Theory of Advertising, in which psychology was first applied to business; in  when Hugo Munsterberg

wrote Psychology and Industrial Efficiency, which was first published in English in ; or in  when Scott wrote the book Increasing Human Efficiency in Business (Koppes & Pickren, ). Regardless of the official starting date, I/O psychology was born in the early s. In addition to Scott and Munsterburg, pioneers in the field include James Cattell, Walter Bingham, John Watson, Marion Bills, and Lillian Gilbreth (DiClemente & Hantula, ). Interestingly, the term “industrial psychology” was seldom used prior to World War I. Instead, the com- mon terms for the field were “economic psychology,” “business psychology,” and “employment psychology” (Koppes & Pickren, ).

I/O psychology made its first big impact during World War I. Because of the large number of soldiers who had to be assigned to various units within the armed forces, I/O psychologists were employed to test recruits and then place them in appropriate positions. The testing was accomplished mainly through the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests of mental ability. The Alpha test was used for recruits who could read and the Beta test for recruits who could not read. The more intelligent recruits were assigned to officer training, and the less intelligent to the infantry. Interestingly, John Watson, who is better known as a pioneer in behaviorism, served as a major in the U.S. Army in World War I and developed perceptual and motor tests for potential pilots (DiClemente & Hantula, ). I/O psychologists, especially Henry Gantt, were responsible for increasing the efficiency with which cargo ships were built, repaired, and loaded (Van De Water, ).

Though certainly not an I/O psychologist, inventor Thomas A. Edison under- stood the importance of selecting the right employees. In , Edison created a -item knowledge test that he administered to over  applicants. The test and passing score were so difficult that only % of the applicants passed! You will learn more about Edison’s test in the Applied Case Study at the end of Chapter .

Two of the most interesting figures in the early years of I/O psychology were the husband and wife team of Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth. The Gilbreths were among the first, if not the first, scientists to improve pro- ductivity and reduce fatigue by studying the motions used by workers. Frank began his career as a contractor and became famous for developing improve- ments in bricklaying that reduced the number of motions needed to lay a brick from  to  ½. Lillian, the much more educated of the two, received her Ph.D. from Brown University in —a rare achievement for a woman at that time. As a couple, they had  children, and the efficiency methods they used to raise their children while having busy careers were the inspira- tion for the book and the movie Cheaper by the Dozen (the  version of the movie). After Frank’s death in  at the age of , Lillian continued her consulting with industry, as the Great Depression forced companies to find ways to reduce costs and be more productive. In , she became a professor of management and engineering at Purdue University, the first woman to hold such a position.

During these early years, I/O psychology thrived outside of the United States. Prominent psychologists who applied psychology to problems in industry outside the United States included Jules Suter in Switzerland; Bernard Muscio in Australia; Franziska Baumgarten-Tramer, Walter Moede, William Stern, Otto Lipmann, and Emil Kraepelin in Germany; Jean Marie Lahy in France; Edward Webster in Canada; and Cyril Burt, Charles Myers, and Sir Frederick Bartlett in Great Brittan (Vinchur & Koppes, ; Warr, ).

Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were pioneers in I/O Psychology.
