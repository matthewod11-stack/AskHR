# productivity win.

If it’s not easy to transport your work because you need multiple

computer screens or other special equipment, there are still ways that

you can infuse some variety into your routine. One could be through

a virtual coworking buddy. You could ask a coworker or friend to work

alongside you on a video call. Or you could use a service like FocusMate,

which will pair you with someone else in the world who needs to get

something done at the same time you do.
