# 128 PERSONALITY AND WORK

There are some notable exceptions in the literature that ask for emotional states at a speciﬁc point in time as they are occurring (Weiss, Nicholas, & Daus, 1999; Wofford, Goodwin, & Daly, 1999). However, even here, the momentary data are often aggregated be- fore analysis. Wofford et al. (1999) asked for recollections of emo- tions felt in speciﬁc situations, such as “on last being with their supervisor” or “on last returning home from work.” The responses for ﬁve different situations were then averaged to obtain an affect score to be assessed in relation to various personality variables.

Our third observation is that the use of one-time surveys has been the overwhelming format of choice for those studying per- sonality and affective experiences. Studies are often conducted in a cross-sectional, one-time assessment of all variables of interest (George, 1990; Saavedra & Kwun, 2000). Some studies have used longitudinal designs (Portello & Long, 2001; Spector & O’Connell, 1994) but are still assessing the affective constructs at one, or maybe two, points in time. For example, Spector and O’Connell (1994) gathered information on personality at time 1 and then twelve to ﬁfteen months later assessed the level of job strain that participants experienced. It should be noted that the majority of the studies that fall under this category were aimed at studying things that we have concluded are not affect but related constructs such as job satisfaction and psychological strain.

Other techniques (such as diary or experiential sampling meth- ods) have been used more rarely, but in a higher percentage, in studies speciﬁcally interested in affective experiences as the de- pendent variable (Bohle & Tilley, 1993; Portello & Long, 2001; Shiu, 1998). These formats are better able to capture the affective process. However, the same problem of aggregation persists with some of these methods. Despite the attempt to measure a mo- mentary phenomenon, when looking at personality, many diary studies average the momentary data (see Weiss et al., 1999, as an example) or ask for the respondent’s feelings or mood for that day (Buunk & Verhoeven, 1991). This masks any qualitative changes that have occurred throughout the day. Some studies, however, have used an experiential sampling technique to assess the pattern of emotions by asking the participants about their current emo- tional states at several points in time, resulting in a proﬁle of the participant’s emotional states over the time of the study and look- ing at personality correlates with the patterns.
