# The Theories of Bonds and of Connections

Theory of Bonds. Spearman’s theory was soon challenged and continues to be challenged today (e.g., Gardner, 1983; R. J. Sternberg, 1999b). One of Spearman’s chief critics was British psychologist Sir Godfrey Thomson, who accepted Spearman’s statistics but not his interpretation. Thomson (1939) argued that it is possible to have a general psychome- tric factor in the absence of any kind of general ability. In particular, he argued that g is a statistical reality but a psy- chological artifact. He suggested that the general factor might result from the working of an extremely large number of what he called bonds, all of which are sampled simultane- ously in intellectual tasks. Imagine, for example, that each of the intellectual tasks found in Spearman’s and others’ test batteries requires certain mental skills. If each test samples all of these mental skills, then their appearance will be per- fectly correlated with each other because they always co- occur. Thus, they will give the appearance of a single general factor when in fact they are multiple.

Although Thomson did not attempt to specify exactly what the bonds might be, it is not hard to speculate on what
