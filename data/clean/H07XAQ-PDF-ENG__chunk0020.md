We expect most L&D professionals are nodding as they review these

motivations. Dealing with each of them takes a unique skill set and

is rarely quick and easy. It requires understanding behavior-change

dynamics and related timelines. It requires patience. It requires

conﬁdence to push back and to leave things out. With so much on our

plates and virtually no free time, it’s easier to throw whole boxes of

spaghetti at the wall and hope that something sticks, rather than ﬁnd

the one strand best suited to solve the problem.
