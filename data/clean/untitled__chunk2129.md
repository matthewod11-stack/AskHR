# Military Forces

The two world wars provided occasions for psychologists to demonstrate psychology’s value to society during times when skepticism about the science existed (e.g., Capshew, 1999; Hill, 1955; von Mayrhauser, 1987). During both wars, the

Stanley Hall ﬁrst suggested the use of psychology in the military in 1916 while addressingajointsessionoftheAPAandtheAmericanAssoci- ation for the Advancement of Science (Hergenhahn, 1997). When the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, a group of psychologists led by Robert M.Yerkes (then president of APA) and others (from the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science,andtheAPA)formedthePsychologyCommitteeof theNationalResourceCounciltoevaluateapsychologicalex- amining program for recruits (von Mayrhauser, 1987).At the sametime,W.D.ScottandW.V.Bingham,facultyatCarnegie Institute of Technology, formed the Committee on Classiﬁca- tion and Personnel to aid the army in the selection of ofﬁcers (von Mayrhauser, 1987).

Although many psychologists were involved with World War I, Yerkes and his colleagues received the most publicity for developing the Army Alpha and Army Beta group mental ability tests. These tests paved the way for large-scale intelli- gence testing and for later expansion of psychological testing into government, industry, and education (Katzell & Austin, 1992). After the war, the military increased spending to iden- tify ways to improve the efﬁciency of the ﬁghting forces, thus creating opportunities for psychological research and appli- cation under the auspices of the armed forces. In addition, the success of psychological applications during the war stimu- lated the interests of corporate leaders to use psychology in their businesses.

The Second World War, like the First World War, created the opportunity for psychologists to apply their techniques. The army sought the assistance of psychologists, who were ready to be involved (e.g., Capshew, 1999). Signiﬁcant accomplishments included the Army General Classiﬁcation Test (AGCT), situational stress tests, assessment centers, and simulation training. One of the ﬁrst comprehensive applied psychology programs was the Aviation Psychology Program directed by J. C. Flanagan and published in 19 volumes (Flanagan, 1947–1949). APA Division 14 (now SIOP) past president (1976–1977) Paul W. Thayer recalled,

World War II had an interesting effect on I/O. . . . It threw to- gether a number of psychologists, some industrial, some experi- mental, some measurement, etc., in a variety of places. Wallace and Flanagan worked with some experimental types in the Army Air Corps (later the USAF), while McGehee and others were in the Navy. Wherry worked with the Army in D.C., and Shartle continued his work on job classiﬁcation. . . . Experimental psy- chologists learned to respect what applied psychologists could
