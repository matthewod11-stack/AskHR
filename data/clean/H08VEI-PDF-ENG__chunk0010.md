# Focus on frontline managers.

Frontline managers are key to how messages get communicated and

how teams respond, so Carroll recommends prioritizing them. They

work directly with employees and have a clearer view of what’s actually

happening, she says. “Frontline managers have an outsized inﬂuence

on whether people stay motivated and see how their work matters,” she

adds. “Leaders need to help them see that communication is a key part

of their job, and give them the skills and tools to do it well.”
