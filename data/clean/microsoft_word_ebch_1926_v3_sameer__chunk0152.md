- 2. Timing and Frequency:

The timing and frequency of performance appraisals can be problematic. Annual reviews may not provide timely feedback, making it challenging for employees to improve in real-time.

- 3. Employee Resistance:

Employees may resist performance appraisal due to fear, anxiety, or skepticism about the process. They may view it as a judgmental exercise rather than an opportunity for growth.

- 4. Inaccurate Data:

Gathering accurate and comprehensive data to assess performance can be difficult. Some aspects of performance may be challenging to measure objectively.
