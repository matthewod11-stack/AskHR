In respect of competency frameworks, we have profiled similar trends towards simplification and more user-friendly and user-driven approaches, with for example, only common core competencies often now being specified. Again, support from the top and through excellent training and communications are critical enablers. Personal development and a future focus on development, rather than on past performance rating and reward, are also commonly apparent.

There are also many arguments when considering the link between performance management and reward. We have seen that a pay link may connect the actions of employees to organisational goals and this link can foster the right behaviours in employees, but in order to achieve a genuine link the practice of performance, competency or contribution related pay must be transparent and the link between pay and performance must not be compromised. Reward in this context can act as a direct incentive to some employees and can offer the flexibility to recognise individual achievements or contributions, however reward must not undermine the ‘felt fair’ perception of equity for employees.

Good practice in performance management is summarised by Armstrong and Baron (2005) through comments made by case study organisations that they visited. These provided some interesting insights into developments in performance management. For example:

‘We expect line managers to recognise it [performance management] as a useful contribution to the management of their teams rather than a chore.’
