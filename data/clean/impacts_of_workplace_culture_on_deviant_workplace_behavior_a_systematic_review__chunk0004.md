Abstract Deviant workplace behavior violates organizational standards and has the potential to hurt either the entire organization or specific members of the organization. It is a serious and present problem in the workplace. Workplace culture have been linked to deviant workplace behavior however, there has been a scarcity of research and reviews on the impact of workplace culture on deviant workplace behavior. Scopus, Sage, MEDLINE and Web of Science Journals were used to look for terms relating to workplace culture (workplace culture, organizational culture) as well as terms related to deviant workplace beha- vior (deviant behavior, deviances). Original research, samples, or gendered employee subsamples were considered for this evaluation of workplace culture that have an impact on deviant workplace behavior, and the research must be completed in English. This evaluation has 19 publications that passed the eligibility criteria. This reviewâ€™s results showed that deviant work- place behavior is significantly influenced by workplace culture with different interpretation of culture and measurement used. These findings are explored in light of existing gaps in the literature and fresh research opportunities.
