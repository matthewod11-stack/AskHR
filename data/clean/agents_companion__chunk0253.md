history's most famous composers. Beyond that well-known fact, Salzburg's old town is a

UNESCO World Heritage site, and parts of the beloved musical 'The Sound of Music' were

filmed there in 1964. The Salzburg Festival, one of the world's most prestigious music and

drama festivals, has been held there annually since 1920."
