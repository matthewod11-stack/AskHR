# High Procedural justice

Further, we attempted to explore whether pay comparison and access to pay information would explain some of the observed gender differences. On step 3, the incremental variance significantly added to the prediction of organizational commitment in both Model 1 (F = 9.569, p < .001) and Model 2 (F = 5.909, p < .01), which suggests that our mediators predict organizational commitment over and above the main and interactive effects of gender, pay inequity, and procedural justice. Access to pay information ((cid:2) = .162-.169, p > .05) and internal pay comparison ((cid:2) = .199-.264, p > .01) were related to higher organizational commitment. External pay comparison ((cid:2) = -.118-.157, p > .05) was related to a lower level of organizational commitment. This is
