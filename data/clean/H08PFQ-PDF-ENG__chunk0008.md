What makes this new breed of intruder particularly diﬃcult is that

unlike previous routine market or organizational challenges, they’re

precedent setting. That means leadership teams will naturally fumble a

bit as they ﬁnd their footing in unchartered terrain, and that fumbling

can cause conﬁdence in the team to dip further. Meanwhile, your

stakeholders are desperately trying to make sense of the unknown. Valid

While you may not have answers—and new information is likely to

change your mind—leadership teams must be prepared to adapt and

share your thinking about decisions as things unfold. Here are six things

your leadership team can do to maintain and strengthen conﬁdence in

the team’s ability to lead amid turbulence.
