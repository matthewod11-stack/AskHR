# 90 Sensation and Perception

program; hence, the name computational theories is often used. These are computations associated with certain algo- rithms that are presumed to be innate or preprogrammed; thus, this is not an inferential process but rather application of a ﬁxed processing algorithm, making this viewpoint some- what reminiscent of the ideas of Kant.

While computational perception has a certain allure for the burgeoning ﬁeld of cognitive science, and there are still some advocates of direct perception, the vast majority of per- ceptual researchers and theorists seem to have accepted a compromise position that accepts the distinction between sensation and perception. Correspondence between percep- tion and reality is maintained because there is a rich source of information in the direct sensory inputs (in other words, sensation is reliable). However, there are some ambiguities that can be corrected by using experiential and inferential processes to derive the perceived object from the available sensory data (in other words, there are nonsensory contribu- tions that shape the ﬁnal conscious percept).
