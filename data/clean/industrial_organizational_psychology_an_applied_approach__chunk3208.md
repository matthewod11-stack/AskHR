# Exercise . in your workbook.

As discussed in the Chapter , many employees are more satisfied with their jobs if they feel they have some control over what they do. As a result, many orga- nizations are “empowering” employees to participate in and make decisions. As you will see in the following pages, empowering employees can range from ask- ing them for their opinions to giving them complete decision-making control. However, before discussing ways to empower employees—which I will refer to as ways to increase “levels of employee input”—it might be best to first discuss why and when employees should be involved in decision making.

Making the Decision to Empower Factors in Making the Decision to Empower Employees need to be involved in decisions in circumstances in which the qual- ity of the decision is important, the decision affects employees, the supervisor doesn’t have the knowledge to make the decision, or the employees don’t trust the supervisor. As shown in Figure ., Vroom and Yetton () have developed a flowchart to help determine when employees should be involved in making decisions. The flowchart uses the seven factors discussed next.

Importance of Decision Quality. The first factor to be considered in making a decision is whether one decision will be better than another. For example, if a supervisor is trying to decide whether to sign a letter with blue ink or black ink, his decision probably will not make any difference to the organization. Thus, the importance of the decision quality is low, and little time or effort should be spent making it.

Leader Knowledge of the Problem Area. The second factor in decision making involves the extent to which leaders have sufficient information to make the decision alone. If they do, then consultation with others is desired only if leaders want their subordinates to feel involved. If leaders lack sufficient knowledge to make a decision, consultation is essential. For example, it would be difficult for managers to select a benefit package without first asking their employees about the types of benefits they need.

Structure of the Problem. The third factor of concern in decision making is the extent to which a leader knows what information is needed and how it can be obtained— that is, the problem’s structure. If the leader does not know how to obtain this information, the decision-making process will require other people, and the deci- sion will take longer to reach.

Importance of Decision Acceptance. The fourth decision-making factor involves the degree to which it is important that the decision be accepted by others. For exam- ple, for a supervisor to decide what hours each employee will work, it is important that the employees agree with and have input into the decision-making process.
