# office?

The key is to distinguish between macro- and microcultures. We

consistently communicate our core values, particularly during onboarding.

They’re also reflected in our performance management systems. But we

lean on managers to guide new hires and orient them to team norms; we’ve

implemented new training to build their capabilities in that area. In a hybrid

world, associates have fewer but deeper interactions. Their relationship

with their manager is even more important now.

What lessons can you share?

Really listen to associates. Ask whether they have the tools and support

they need to succeed. Is information being shared? Are new technologies

working? It is easy for problems to go undiscovered in a hybrid world. You

have to pay close attention and include associates in creating ways to best

navigate the new work arrangement.
