# Business Logic Contest

When making strategic decisions, leaders typically focus on where to

compete (which industries and markets), pushing oﬀ consideration

of competences, resources, and value chains they’ll need to the

implementation phase. The Business Logic Contest helps leaders to

think about the “what” and “how” of strategy together — to explicitly

integrate the customer interface related to value creation with value

capture and its associated process. This ensures that a company

collectively engages in developing a unique proposition that works

coherently for them. As described in the BPW example above, a

workshop type model brings together a relatively small but diverse set

of people preventing leakage of proprietary information.
