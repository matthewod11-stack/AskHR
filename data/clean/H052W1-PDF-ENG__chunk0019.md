# “Be deliberate.”

Reset your expectations

In those early days of coming back to work, it’s wise to think about how

you can recast yourself professionally. Think about “what makes you special or diﬀerent,” Dowling says. Then consider how to modify those

attributes to suit your new life. “If you were the hardest-working person

in the oﬃce, then maybe you become the most eﬃcient. If you were the

best mentor or project leader, you become the best delegator,” she says.

Your goal is to reset your expectations for yourself. “If you don’t, you

will ﬁnd yourself trying to play a role you can no longer play.” Rousseau

agrees: “You need to be realistic about what you can and should give.”
