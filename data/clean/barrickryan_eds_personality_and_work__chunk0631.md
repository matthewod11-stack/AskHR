# 210 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Those who are relatively low on self-monitoring fulﬁll different motives through their relationships. Low self-monitors may eschew overt impression management, preferring to display attitudes and behaviors that communicate what they consider to be their gen- uine selves. Low self-monitors cultivate relationships based on per- ceived similarities in values, beliefs, and interests. Thus, it is not surprising that low self-monitors have more homogeneous social networks than high self-monitors (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000).

Low self-monitors tend to adopt a partner-based approach to relationships. They strive to maximize the ﬁt between themselves and their friends and associates; relationships are seen as partner- ships built around the mutual appreciation of shared values, ideals, or activities (Snyder, 1987). Low self-monitors, relative to high self- monitors, demonstrate greater levels of commitment to their per- sonal (Snyder & Simpson, 1984) and work relationships (Day et al., 2002), express less intent to leave their current jobs (Jenkins, 1993), and tend to remain with current employers longer (Kilduff & Day, 1994). These noted differences between high and low self- monitors have distinct implications for the respective types of so- cial networks that are created and maintained, as well as for the respective kinds of social capital that are constructed.

A recent review and reappraisal of the research literature on self-monitoring noted a wide range of external criteria that directly tap a central dimension measured by Snyder’s Self-Monitoring Scale (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000; Snyder & Gangestad, 1986). The categories of effects most strongly associated with the central di- mension of self-monitoring were (1) variation in the predisposi- tion to engage in impression management (behavioral variability, sensitivity to expectations, interpersonal orientation, and being im- pressed with physical attractiveness); (2) skills needed for effective image cultivation and projection (expressive control and nonver- bal decoding skills); and (3) the relationship between private be- liefs and public actions (attitude-behavior relations and attitude accessibility).

At its core, however, Gangestad and Snyder (2000) speculate that self-monitoring personality “relates to status-oriented impres- sion management motives” (p. 547). That is, high self-monitors may strive to cultivate public images that create the appearance of social status, and therefore their social networks may serve as a pri-
