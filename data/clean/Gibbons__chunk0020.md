[AI isn\'t just changing how we use technology, it\'s rewriting what
leadership means.]{.underline}

[Research reveals that 70% of AI transformation success depends on
people and process competencies, not technical capabilities. Yet most
executives are still leading with a playbook written for a pre-AI world.
This isn\'t about adding AI to your toolkit or becoming an expert prompt
engineer for a tool that will become obsolete in 6 months --- it\'s
about becoming a leader that navigates paradox, manages human potential
in new ways, and creates meaning in an age of artificial
intelligence.]{.underline}
