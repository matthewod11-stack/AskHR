## 6.5.6 Disagreement Across Sources: Is This a Problem?

If performance information is collected from more than one source, it is likely that there will be some overlap in the dimensions measured.32 For example, a manager’s peers and direct supervisor may rate him on the competency “communication.” In addition to the overlapping dimensions across sources, each source is likely to evalu- ate performance dimensions that are unique to each source. For example, subordinates may evaluate “delegation,” but this competency may not be included on the form used by the direct supervisor. Once the competencies and results that need to be measured are identified for a particular position, a decision needs to be made regarding which source of information will be used to assess each dimension. Of course, it is likely that there will be some overlap, and some dimensions will be rated by more than one source. Regardless of the final decision, it is important that employees take an active role in deciding which sources will rate which dimensions. Active participation in the process is likely to enhance acceptance of results and perceptions that the system is fair. Moreover, studies including master of business administration (MBA) students, executive MBA students, and managers in a large Canadian insurance company found that, when given a choice, individuals tend to select raters whom they think are most acquainted with their work as opposed to how much they like them and how much they think the raters like them.33
