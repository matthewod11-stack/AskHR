# Building in Roadblocks

Once the portfolio of performance and learning tasks is established, the

next step is to design the roadblocks for the learning tasks.

For example, in anticipation of the AI push in their organization,

a ﬁrst-time manager may task their team to design an AI-driven

recommendation feature for the company’s e-commerce platform.

Given the novelty of the technology, the task is likely to push the team

beyond its current skill sets and knowledge. To create opportunities

for employees to engage in deep problem-solving, rather than simply

executing known solutions, a manager could:

- 1. Use constraints.

Deliberately place constraints on the task that help employees to think

creatively. For example, limit the amount of training data the team

can access for the AI model, forcing them to get creative with data

augmentation techniques or identifying proxy data. Additionally, you

could add a time constraint by shortening the project from six weeks to

four weeks to drive a sense of urgency and focus. This might prompt

the team to explore alternative, quicker methods of implementation

(e.g., open-source libraries or pre-trained models) instead of relying on
