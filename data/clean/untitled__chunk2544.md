# International Organizational Efforts

Health psychology was also becoming more organized in Europe during the same period of time. Six years after APA Division 38 was founded, Professor Stan Maes organized an international conference on health psychology in Tilburg (the Netherlands),whichtheninitiatedtheformationin1986ofthe European Health Psychology Society (EHPS) (Schwarzer & Johnston, 1994). At this meeting were also Marie Johnston (UK), John Weinman (UK), Ralf Schwarzer (Germany), Ad Kaptein (the Netherlands), Lothar Schmidt and Peter Schwenkmezger (Germany), and Jan Vinck (Belgium), who became key people in the development of health psychology in Europe and in their own countries. It is interesting to note that among the 60 participants was a large contingent from the United States, including Charles Spielberger and Irwin Sarason, who supported the development of a European asso- ciation. At that conference, it also became apparent that a substantial amount of research was being conducted in various European countries on topics relevant to health psychology (Maes, 1990; Maes, Spielberger, Defares, & Sarason, 1988).

The creation of the EHPS in 1986 represents an important landmarkforthedevelopmentofhealthpsychologyinEurope. The purpose of the EHPS is “the promotion and development within Europe of empirical and theoretical research and appli- cations of health psychology and the interchange of informa- tion relating to this subject between European members and other associations throughout the world” (Schwarzer & Johnston, 1994, p. 4). Since then, the EHPS annual confer- ences have offered an important setting for exchange among the major European scholars in the ﬁeld. They also provide a forum for the discussion of issues facing health psychology in Europe, both as a science and a profession.The growing num- berofparticipantsintheEHPSconferencesfrom1988to1996 illustrates the development of the ﬁeld. There were 60 partici- pantsin1986,100in1989(Utrecht,theNetherlands),and500 in 1996 (Dublin, Ireland).

Another important landmark in the deﬁnition of health psychology in Europe was a document written by the European Federation of Professional Psychologist’s Associa- tions (EFPPA) and published by the WHO Regional Ofﬁce for Europe in 1984; this document clariﬁes the contribution of psychology to the health ﬁeld. The EFPPA has played an important role in the development of professional health psychology, as will be detailed later.
