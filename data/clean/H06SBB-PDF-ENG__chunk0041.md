# together.

ADI IGNATIUS: Another question that all companies have is the

million-dollar question: how do you innovate? How do you perpetually

create a sort of perpetual innovation machine in your company? And

this is a question from James in Sydney who asked about the role of

serendipity and randomness in innovation. I know as employers we talk

about it being good to be together physically because there are these

sparks, but does that really happen?

SANDY SPEICHER: I think it does really help. Serendipity really does

help because through some of those interactions, you might learn

something that you hadn’t known before, and it might help you connect

a dot in your mind on a problem that you’re working on.

Of course, that doesn’t mean that being in the office is the only way to

do that. I think the key for that is to be looking for inspiration, to be

asking different types of questions, to be seeking outside of what your

current experiences and knowledge are in order to help expand your

mind with inspiration, which is the thing that helps us get to new ideas.

Recently, someone I work with was talking about this, that in meetings,

what we’re often looking for is to find common ground. What’s the

pieces that we all agree on so that we can move forward?
