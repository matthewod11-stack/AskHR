## Computer-Based or Web-Based Programmed Instruction

Rather than using books and traditional videos for distance learning, many orga- nizations are using computer-based training (CBT) and e-learning; as of , % of all training hours are completed using CBT or e-learning (ASTD, ). The difference between the two is that e-learning is Web-based and CBT is not (Roberts, ). With CBT and e-learning, employees can choose from a variety of training programs offered on-site, through the Internet, or through an orga- nization’s intranet, and complete the training programs at their own pace. Most CBT and e-learning programs provide material in small chunks and then pose a series of questions to the employee. If the employee does not answer enough questions correctly, the computer informs the employee about the areas in which he needs help and returns him to the appropriate material.

A common method of CBT and e-learning is interactive video. With interac- tive video, employees see a videotaped situation on a television, computer screen, or iPod. At the end of each situation, employees choose their response to the situation and the computer selects a video that shows what would happen based on the employee’s response. The H. E. Butt Grocery Company decided to use interactive video at its grocery stores because of the difficulty in getting employee schedules coordinated for group training. Butt’s first interactive video training focused on food safety practices and included such features as a virtual notepad, allowing trainees to take notes on the computer, and a bacteria growth simulator (don’t you wish you had one of those?).

Captain D’s Seafood provides an example of a company that switched from paper-based programmed instruction to CBT. Captain D’s spent $ million to develop CBT programs and install computers in each of its  restaurants. As a result of this new training, mystery-shopper ratings have increased by % (Maurer, ).

Similar success was found at FedEx. Because FedEx has more than  loca- tions, costs for sending trainers to each location are high. As a solution to this high cost, FedEx placed more than , interactive video units at its  locations.

This change from live seminars to interactive video reduced training expenses, reduced customer contact training time from  to  hours, and resulted in the company’s receiving several awards for its innovative program (Wilson, ).

In the public sector, many law enforcement agencies are using e-learning. For example, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center provides more than , courses through e-learning, and the U.S. Capitol Police provides its officers access to more than , Web-based courses. Two law enforcement agencies in Florida saved $, in travel-related expenses in one year by using e-learning. Because creating an e-learning training program can be expensive, most organizations con- tract with a learning portal, that is, a website containing a variety of e-courses. For example, TrainSeek.com is a learning portal with more than , e-courses.

Fast-growing sources of e-learning are teleconferences, webinars, and web- casts. Webinars (short for Web-based seminar) and webcasts are training pro- grams transmitted over the Web. The difference between the two is that a webinar is interactive whereas a webcast involves one-way communication from the trainer. With a teleconference, trainees are sent a PowerPoint presentation that they view on their computer while the trainer conducts the audio portion of the training over the phone. As with webinars, teleconferences can be interactive in nature.

Another fast-growing source of e-learning is interactive, online communi- ties of learning such as blogs, wikis, and listserves. With each of these methods, rather than waiting for an annual conference or scheduled training program, employees can ask questions, get immediate answers, post opinions, and share information with others in similar fields.

Meta-analysis results indicate that CBT and e-learning are at least as effective as classroom training and their effectiveness increases when learners can control the pace of the learning and when feedback is given regarding the learner’s prog- ress (Sitzmann, Kraiger, Stewart, & Wisher, ).
