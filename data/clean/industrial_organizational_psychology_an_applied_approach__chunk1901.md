## Programmed Instruction Using Books, Videos, or Interactive Video

With this method, employees are provided with media materials for learning the content, as well as with a series of exams that measure what they have learned from them. If employees do not pass the test at the end of each unit, they must reread the material and retake the test until they pass. In this way, employees study at their own pace, and the exams ensure that employees understand the material. The training program used by Life of Virginia (Richmond) is a good exam- ple. One problem encountered by the company was that more than , sales agents were spread over  offices throughout the country. Thus, to conduct a training program that would be both effective and practical, Life of Virginia used sales experts to create seven training modules: marketing and asking for referrals, calling for appointments, interviews, preparing the insurance recommendation, presenting the recommendation, delivering the insurance policy, and periodic review. Each module contained a - to -page reading assignment, a written exercise on the reading, a videotape showing models performing the appropriate behaviors, a situational problem, and a series of questions to be answered by each insurance agent. Agents study at their own pace, taking between two and four weeks per module. This training program resulted in a % annual increase in sales and a % decrease in turnover.
