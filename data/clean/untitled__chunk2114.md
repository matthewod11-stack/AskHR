# Employment

When I-O psychology emerged, almost all psychologists were employed in academia, and psychologists who did ap- plied work did so on a part-time basis. Some academic psy- chologists pursued part-time consulting work to supplement their meager academic salaries (Goodwin, 1999). Others sought applied work because the number of psychology doctoral graduates quickly outgrew the number of positions in psychology departments and laboratories. Cattell (1946) estimated that as late as 1917 only 16 of the more than 300 members of APA were working primarily in the various applications of psychology. Napoli (1981) revealed no full- time I-O psychologists from 1913 through 1917; how- ever, there were individuals practicing I-O psychology, although their work was not labeled as such. In 1916, Walter Dill Scott was appointed professor of applied psychology at Carnegie Institute ofTechnology, the ﬁrst appointment by that title in academia (Landy, 1997).

After World War I, additional employment opportunities became available in academia, the military, government, pri- vate industry, and consulting organizations (e.g., the U.S. Civil Service Commission, Kaufman Department Store, Macy’s department store, Aetna Life Insurance, U.S. Rubber Company, Procter & Gamble, Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company) (Katzell & Austin, 1992). These oppor- tunities paved the way for employment of women psycholo- gists who faced barriers gaining employment in academia (Koppes, 1997). Katzell and Austin (1992) estimated that the total number of industrial psychologists by the end of the 1920s was approximately 50.

Employment in academia slowed during the 1930s, but employment in other areas improved. Between 1916 and 1938, the number of APA members in teaching positions in- creased ﬁvefold, from 233 to 1,299; however, the number of members in applied positions grew almost 29 times, from 24 to 694 (Finch & Odoroff, 1939). In 1940, Darley and Berdie
