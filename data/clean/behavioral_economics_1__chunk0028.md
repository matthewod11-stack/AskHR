# division of labor.

Recent evidence shows substantial effects of basic intelligence on the tendency to make the kind of

judgment mistakes documented in the heuristics literature, and on risk-aversion and immediacy preference

(Benjamin and Shapiro, 2005; Frederick, 2005). This kind of evidence invites the possibility that “smarter”

people will be sorted into jobs where their decisions minimize or repair mistakes by others. In a magazine

interview Gary Becker opined that “division of labor…’strongly attenuates if not eliminates’ any effects caused

by bounded rationality” (Stewart, 2005).12

Becker’s conjecture should be explored theoretically and empirically. The power of division of labor to

necessarily produce organizational efficiency may be limited by various factors. First of all, large organizations

demand some skills at a very high level (e.g., extreme honesty when there are huge opportunities for theft). A

limited supply of agents with enough skill will then limit the size of the firm.

Second, the sorting process requires a human resources department or other mechanism to identify

talent. If the ability to spot talent is itself a scarce talent, or self-selection is limited by optimism (for example),

those forces will limit how much talent is spotted.

Third, what happens if managers are biased in one dimension but excellent at another? Hard-driving

CEO’s, for example, may be superb at motivating people and creating an inspiring vision, precisely because

they are wildly optimistic and genuinely convinced they can’t fail. So it is possible that the sorting process of

managerial selection actually selects for optimism rather than selects for realism. The organizational challenge

is to design job structure that harnesses a CEO’s optimism as motivation, but keeps that optimism from making
