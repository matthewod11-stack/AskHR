# Data Analysis

Dataanalysisoccurredattwodistinctlevels.Fortheindividual level of analysis, basic descriptive statistics and logistic and ordinary least squares regression models were conducted. For the company level of analysis, bivariate correlations were analyzed in addition to the basic descriptive statistics. All analyses used the SAS package of statistical programs (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Of those who enrolled, about 60% actively participated in the program. Over time, the average number of risks reported by participants dropped by about 8% (−0.318/4.051) from the baseline. In the company level of analysis, the proportion male was consistently lower when averaged across all of the organizations included in the study. The average age in all companies was com- parable and the risk proﬁles for employees in all companies were similar. Because averaging the individual-level data within the com- panies captures differences in company recruitment policies, which bylawmustnotdiscriminateonthebasisofageorsex,thevariability of the data at the company level was substantially less than that of the individual-level analysis.
