The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA) provides for parity in the application of aggregate lifetime and

annual dollar limits on mental health beneﬁts with dollar limits on medical/surgical beneﬁts. Generally, group

health plans oﬀering mental health beneﬁts cannot set annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health beneﬁts

that are lower than any such dollar limits for medical and surgical beneﬁts.

The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) expanded the protections of MHPA to

ﬁnancial requirements (e.g., copayments or deductibles)and treatment limitations (e.g., visit limits). Any type of

ﬁnancial requirements or treatment limitations imposed on mental health or substance use disorder beneﬁts in

a classiﬁcation can be no more restrictive than the predominant requirements or limitations applied to

substantially all medical and surgical beneﬁts covered by a plan in the classiﬁcation. In addition, there are rules regarding nonquantitative treatment limitations (such as prior authorization requirements).

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits group health plans and group health
