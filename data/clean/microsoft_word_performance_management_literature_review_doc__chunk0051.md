The 2010 CIPD survey found that three-quarters of those which link performance and pay use a combination of factors to determine pay progression, including considerations of skills and competence, as well as other factors such as the market and individual performance results achieved. This is what Brown and Armstrong (1999) called ‘contribution-related pay’, ie the term they used to describe approaches that combine recognition for both inputs and outputs — how results are achieved as well as the results themselves. This approach is a formal combination of competency and performance-related pay. Brown and Armstrong believe that contribution-based pay is a desirable approach precisely because it covers both inputs and outputs in a way that is reflective of most jobs. Using the term contribution-based pay is also a recognition that a number of organisations, though describing their pay system as either competency-based or performance- related, are actually a combination of both.

Overall, given the massive effort which goes into managing performance-related pay systems, the evidence that they improve performance is very weak indeed. As Armstrong and Baron (2005) write ‘the problem with contingent pay is not that the principle is faulty, but that the practice is flawed’.
