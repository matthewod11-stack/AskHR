# Circadian rhythm adaptability

and so on. A survey of  U.S. and Canadian companies using shifts found that % used rotating rather than fixed shifts (Circadian Technologies, ).

The rationale for rotating shifts is that the negative effects of working swing and night shifts can be lessened if each employee is allowed to work the day shift part of the time. With fixed shifts, even though two-thirds of all workers will have hours that are not compatible with their circadian rhythms, staying permanently on the same shifts will allow them to physically adjust better than if they change shifts, especially when considering that about two days are needed to adjust to each shift change.

Research on shift rotation has strongly suggested that fixed shifts result in fewer performance, physical, and psychological problems than do rotating shifts (Buddhavarapu, Borys, Hormant, & Baltes, ; Frese & Okonek, ; Jamal & Jamal, ; Verhaegen, Cober, de Smedt, & Dirkx, ). For example, Jamal () found that employees on fixed shifts had less absenteeism and tardiness, greater job satisfaction and social participation, and better mental health than did their counterparts working rotating shifts. The results of a meta-analysis (Buddhavarapu et al., ) and a traditional review of the literature (Wilkinson, ) concluded that fixed shifts were superior to rotating shifts, especially for industrial workers.

Frequency of Rotation Although fixed shifts are better for individuals than rotating shifts, sometimes shifts must be rotated because employees who feel stuck on swing and night shifts insist on having the opportunity to work days. In such situations, the frequency of the shift rotation must be considered. That is, should the rotation occur daily? Weekly? Monthly? The  Shiftwork Practices Survey (Circadian Technolo- gies, ) found that % of organizations that rotate shifts do so weekly, % rotate every two weeks, and % rotate monthly.

Meta-analysis results indicate that fixed shifts result in fewer sleep problems than rotating shifts and that slowly rotating shifts result in fewer sleep problems than do faster rotating shifts (Pilcher, Lambert, & Huffcutt, ). If shifts are to be rotated, the rotation should be clockwise (Circadian Technologies, ), with later starting times for the morning shift (Barton & Folkard, ; Knauth, ). Rest periods of at least two days between shift rotations can lessen the negative effects of the rotations (Totterdell, Spelten, Smith, Barton, & Folkard, ).

Individual Diff erences The final factor concerning the effects of shift work involves individual differ- ences in employees. Obviously, not all employees will react to shift work in the same way because of the differences in their biological time clocks. In fact, we have all probably known people who claimed to be “night people” or to “prefer the morning.” These individual differences in time preference are called chrono- types (Greenwood, ).

Several questionnaires have been developed to distinguish so-called morning people from evening people. Perhaps the best of these was developed by Smith, Reilly, and Midkiff (), which contains the  most reliable and valid ques- tions from three other available scales (Reilly & Smith, ). Such a question- naire can be used to select and place employees in their optimal shifts. Introverts tend to be morning people more than do extraverts (Harma, ). Males adapt to shift work better than do females, and shift work affects older workers more than younger workers (Oginska, Pokorski, & Oginski, ).
