that threatened to derail the conversation.” Robin’s normal response to

such criticism would have been to defend her organization’s work and

to engage in problem-solving on the issues raised. Instead, she decided

was able to get the meeting back on track and to get agreement on what

her team and the clients would do to complete the project successfully.

of actions over time, as Robin did. Our analysis has revealed that once

they start practicing leadership-in-ﬂow, executives perform just as well

with actions they’ve picked up during event preparation as they do

with actions they’ve been trained on at a workshop. This is because the

actions are simple, and the neural pathways needed to use most of them

are already present in us.

In our early years, we associate learning with structured classrooms and

set curriculums. Yet as we navigate the complexities of work and life, it

becomes evident that some of our most profound breakthroughs emerge

when we are “in the ﬂow”—when we immerse ourselves in real-world

experiences and challenges, respond in real time as conditions change,

and tap into virtues and energies already present in our core.

Losing touch with the ﬁve energies amid life’s whirlwind is natural,

but rekindling them is within our reach. All we need to do is focus on
