well as hiring new talent for unfilled job positions. One remote work downside has been many employees feeling less connected to their employer. Especially with some type of hybrid arrangement continuing for many, to help with retention, companies must find a way to increase their employees feeling “connected to the company’s mission, the company’s leaders and to their team” (Laker, 2022).

The search for new talent has been dubbed as a game of “musical chairs” (Laker, 2022) where many “employees swap jobs.” It isn’t just a question of hiring qualified new talent but also keeping them. Beyond expanding the talent pool (e.g., to nontraditional workers), and revising compensation and (including work-life balance), De Smet, Dowling, Mugayar- benefits Baldocci and Schaninger (2022) have argued that companies need to create “sticky” workplaces, which includes “listening to employees, anticipating and addressing their concerns, and a fostering psychological safety and a sense of community.”

Several recent practitioner articles have acknowledged the importance of creating employee feelings of organizational belonging. In a study of over 11,800 participants, Herbert (2020) found that fostering a sense of organ- izational belonging included: “having a connection, feeling like a valued team member; a perception they can be themselves at work; and a belief that their company is one where everyone can succeed to their full poten- tial, no matter who they are.” In a survey of over 5,000 employees in Brazil, China, Germany, the UK, and the US, 82% of the respondents indi- cated they felt lonely at work, with 46% indicating they were likely to leave a job because of loneliness (Gurchiek, 2022). Keys to feeling a sense of organizational belonging included being able to freely voice one’s opinion, even if it differed from others, as well as feeling connected to others at work (Gurchiek, 2022).

Given this revitalized importance for studying organizational belonging (OB), the study’s purpose was to develop a valid and reliable scale for measuring OB and to also investigate its antecedents and outcomes. However, a literature review of existing OB-related research was first needed to document progress to date. Based on this literature review, we used the definition of OB offered by Belle, Burley, and Long (2015, p. 90), “experiencing an acknowledgment of one’s talents, interests and experien- ces, and finding whole acceptance of one’s self expression of these.”

The literature review below first briefly contrasts OB against related organizational constructs. It then systematically reviews prior empirical research on OB and related constructs, such as Workplace Belongingness, Employee Belongingness, Organizational Connectedness, and General Belonging. Individual study critiques of prior research are also included, as well as short section summaries, before looking at qualitative research to
