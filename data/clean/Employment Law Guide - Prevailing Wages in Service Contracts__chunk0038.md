# Penalties/Sanctions

Violations of the SCA may result in contract terminations and liability for resulting costs to the government, withholding of contract payments in suﬃcient amounts to cover wage and fringe beneﬁt underpayments, legal

action to recover the underpayments, and debarment from future contracts for three years.

Contractors and subcontractors may challenge determinations of violations and debarment before an

Administrative Law Judge. Contractors and subcontractors may appeal decisions of Administrative Law

Judges to the Administrative Review Board (ARB). ARB determinations on violations and debarment may be appealed to and are enforceable through the federal courts.

The SCA applies only to contracts awarded by the federal or District of Columbia governments. As noted

above, contractors generally are required to pay employees working on covered contracts for overtime hours worked in accordance with the overtime pay standards of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act.

If the employees are covered by the FLSA, the overtime provisions of the FLSA may apply as well.
