A. Aall, a professor of philosophy, founded Norway’s ﬁrst psychology laboratory at the University of Oslo.

The 20th anniversary celebration of Clark University brought together G. Stanley Hall, William James, and leading Europeans. It was Freud’s only appearance in the United States; he called it “the ﬁrst ofﬁcial recognition of our work.”

The ﬁrst Czech psychological laboratory opened in Prague at the Physiological Institute of the School of Medicine.
