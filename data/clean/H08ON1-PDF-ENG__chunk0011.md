## ﬁve years and counting after the integration. Employee engagement

has important implications for proﬁt and customer satisfaction, and

employee turnover during times of critical organizational change is, at

best, harmful for productivity and, at worst, diminishes the value of the

acquisition. Ironically, the most common sentiment shared by acquired

employees was their desire to bring their own contributions and insights

to the newly integrated ﬁrm, not just the acquired ﬁrm’s technology

and products. And, when acquiring ﬁrms made even ad hoc attempts to

understand or accommodate newly acquired employees, those were met

with gratitude and increased buy-in.

The challenges faced by acquired employees may seem unavoidable,

but they’re not. They can be prevented by due diligence and planning

around the acquired employee integration experience, which is similar

to the due diligence and planning the acquiring ﬁrm does around other

aspects of the deal. Organizations can provide better experiences for

their acquired employees by deploying culture assessments, planning

for culture integration, creating a journey map, empowering mid-level

leaders, and remaining ﬂexible in executing the transition.
