Ads displaying the company emblem and using creative illustrations attract the greatest number of applicants, but ads that include the salary range and a company phone number attract the highest-quality applicants (Kaplan, Aamodt, & Wilk, ). Ads containing realistic information about the job, rather than information that is “too good to be true” increase applicant attraction to the organization (Thorsteinson, Palmer, Wulff, & Anderson, ). Ads containing detailed descriptions of the job and organization provide applicants with an idea of how well they would fit into an organization and result in positive thoughts about it (Roberson, Collins, & Oreg, ). Ads containing information about the selection process affect the probability that applicants will apply for a job. For example, ads stating that an in-person interview will be used to select employees result in applicants being more likely to apply for a job than ads indicating that grade point average (GPA) will be a factor (Reeve & Schultz, ).

In recent years, a trend in help-wanted advertising has been the use of cre- ative, high-energy ads (Levit, ). By using innovative advertising, On-Line Software tripled the number of applicants who responded to its help-wanted ad for secretarial positions. Hyundai’s innovative ad cost only $, and had almost , responses to advertised positions. Some organizations have tried to recruit employees by making fun of the job openings. Here are some examples:

FH Company, a Norwegian importer and distributor, ran a help-wanted advertisement reading, “Tiresome and boring wholesale company seeks indolent people with a total lack of service mindedness for a job that is completely without challenge.” C. Rinker Paving, a Virginia asphalt company, ran a help-wanted advertisement asking for applicants who “have hair short enough to see and hear, are able to gulp down a sandwich in  minutes and be able to work at least  minutes without going to the restroom or drinking something, and have nose and earrings light enough not to interfere with their work.” A national sales company advertised that they were “interested in hiring five semi-obnoxious pushy sales pros for a very boring repetitive job of selling. Our current sales staff is the laziest group of individuals that you’ll ever see drag themselves to work  days a week to decide whether to complain about the weather, coffee, thermostat or the manager.”

Thus, the same techniques and imagination used in product advertisements may increase the recruitment yield from help-wanted ads. That is one reason major advertising firms such as Bernard Hodes and Austin-Knight are increas- ingly involved in the development of recruitment ads and campaigns.

Electronic Media Whereas % of organizations run recruitment advertisements in newspapers, only % use television and radio to advertise job openings (SHRM, b).
