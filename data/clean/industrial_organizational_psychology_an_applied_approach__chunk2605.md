Do not answer the phone when you have someone in your office. It communicates to your visitor that she or he is not important. If you are expecting an important call, tell your visitor in advance that you may have to answer the phone and apologize in advance.

Use voice mail rather than call-waiting during a business conversation. Putting someone on hold so you can answer another call communicates that your current conversation is not important. As mentioned in the previous bullet, if you are expecting an important call that can’t wait, let the person you are talking with know that you might be interrupted and apologize for the inconvenience.

Telephone Calls Another method of business communication is the telephone call. In the past, this method was appropriate only when the message was short and when only a few people needed to receive the communication. But with the advent of confer- ence calls, the number of people who can be reached by this method has certainly increased. Furthermore, telephone calls were previously appropriate only for messages that did not involve detail. But the facsimile, or fax, machine now allows detailed sketches or numbers to be sent to people in different locations in a mat- ter of seconds, and these can then be discussed over the telephone.

One limitation of phone calls, of course, is that nonverbal cues are not available. Thus, a major portion of the message is often not commu- nicated. For important calls, however, video-enhanced teleconferenc- ing (videoconferencing) can now be used. In fact, many organizations save interview expenses by having job applicants across the company participate in such teleconferences, which allow both parties to see one another. A sec- ond limitation to phone calls is that conversations are not documented. For example, one department recently had a problem with an administrator who continually provided incorrect information over the phone or at meetings, denied that she had done so, and then blamed another department for errors that resulted from the use of the information. To correct this problem, employ- ees quit talking to the administrator over the phone and stuck to email, where every “conversation” was documented. Some advice on proper phone etiquette is provided in the Career Workshop box.

Email and Voice Mail Many memos and telephone calls have been replaced with email and voice mail (sophisticated phone-answering systems). Voice mail and email are used pri- marily to exchange general and/or timely information and ask questions; they

are not meant as substitutes for important conversation (Poe, ). The advan- tages to email and voice mail include a reduction in the use and filing of paper and time saved by avoiding “small talk” when communicating a short message by phone.

On the downside, voice mail often results in “phone tag,” and both email and voice mail reduce opportunities for personal contact. In fact, Carillon Health Care Systems recently got rid of its voice mail system because employees and customers were tired of getting answering machines and wanted to talk to “a real person.” Well-designed voice mail systems are limited to simple tasks, have short menus, and allow a caller to talk to a real person at any time during the call.

Email has many advantages over voice mail, including the ability to easily document the sending and receiving of email, the opportunity to communicate with many people at one time, and the potential for quick response times, espe- cially when some form of instant messaging is used. The drawbacks to email include misinterpretations due to the absence of paralanguage, the tendency to be too informal, the increased likelihood of expressing negative emotions (“flam- ing”) that might not have been communicated in person, and the tendency to not proof-read messages (O’Kane, Palmer, & Hargie, ).

Before writing an email message, decide if email is the appropriate com- munication channel. Email is appropriate for preparing people for meetings, scheduling meetings, communicating common news, distributing memos, and summarizing a conversation (Poe, ). Because email eliminates such factors as body language and tone, it is easy to misinterpret the meaning of an email message.

A good rule of thumb is to never put something in an email that you would not want to see published. Examples of material better left unsent include com- ments about other people, complaints, and offensive jokes. Because of the increased use and misuse of email, many organizations, including Merrill Lynch, send their employees through email training. Casperson () and Poe () offer the following email etiquette commonly provided in such training:

Include a greeting (e.g., “Hi, Mark”) and a closing (e.g., “Take care”). Include a detailed subject line. Don’t write in all caps. It is difficult to read and comes across as if you are screaming. If you are going to forward an email message, change the original subject line and delete the long list of previous messages or names of people to whom the email had been previously forwarded. Take the same care in writing (e.g., spelling, grammar) that you would take in writing a formal memo. Don’t spend company time on personal email unless your organization specifically allows you to do so. Allow ample time for the receiver to respond; not everyone considers email to require an immediate response.

When leaving a message on someone’s voice mail, follow these guidelines:

Speak slowly. Give your name at the beginning of the message and then repeat it at the end of the message. Spell your name if the person is not familiar with you or if your name is difficult to spell.

Leave your phone number, even if you think the person already has it. To avoid phone tag, indicate some good times that the person can return your call. Don’t ramble. Anticipate the possibility of getting voice mail rather than talking to the actual person and have a short message ready. Don’t include information that you don’t want other people to hear.

Business Meetings As will be discussed in more detail in Chapter , a common method of business communication is the dreaded committee meeting. Research indicates that the average employee spends an average of . hours attending . meetings each week (Rogelberg, Leach, Warr, & Burnfield, ). Supervisors attended even more meetings (.) and spent more time in these meetings (. hours). Though meetings offer several advantages over email, memos, and phone calls, their time demands can result in negative employee attitudes (Rogelberg et al., ).

Offi ce Design To facilitate employee communication, % of organizations have adopted what is formally called an “open” or “landscaped” office design, and infor- mally called a “cube farm” (Grossman, ). Originally developed by fur- niture manufacturers in West Germany, the design uses large, open office areas without walls. Individual work units are separated into cubicles by such items as plants, bookcases, desks, and partitions. The idea behind this design is that employees will communicate better with one another and be easier to supervise and help without the physical barriers of walls (Poe, ). When it consolidated its many offices into one central location in Minneapolis, Alina Health System was so sold on the idea of an open office environment that even the CEO had a cubicle!

There are three common designs for open or landscaped offices (Martinez, ). In a freestanding design (also called a bullpen design), all desks are placed in a large area that is completely open. With uniform plans, desks are placed at uniform distances and are separated by panels into cubicle areas. Free-form workstations use a combination of designs so that the different needs of each worker can be accommodated.

Two interesting trends in office design are “boulevards” and portable offices. A boulevard is a wide hallway that runs through several departments. The width of the boulevard allows space for impromptu employee communication, and the path of the boulevard through, rather than around, departments encourages employee interaction. Because landscaped, or open, office environments reduce privacy, many organizations have “portable offices” containing an employee’s computer, files, and supplies that can be wheeled into a walled office or cubicle when privacy is needed.

The landscaped office may be appealing, but research has not generally been supportive. Landscaped offices can increase contact and communication and are less expensive than regular offices, but often they can lessen produc- tivity and job satisfaction (Brennan, Chugh, & Kline, ). In a study of more than  employees in  organizations, O’Neill () found that storage space and the ability to adjust or control one’s office space were the best predictors of satisfaction with workspace. Variables such as partition type, panel height, and square footage were not related to satisfaction or performance.
