very simple experimental organizations. They also suggest that efficient coordination

is usually not easy, even in simple games with clear strategies and payoffs, so that

experimental subjects divide labor to create parts of a “man” from LEGO blocks;

they were scored on how good their composite man looked when assembled from the

by the slowest worker, or a recipe which is ruined if it has one bad ingredient (see also Kremer’s (1993)
