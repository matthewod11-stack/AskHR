# by the ideal incumbent.

. Have the panel list the speciﬁ c behaviors necessary for each objective or

standard to be attained.

. Have the panel identify which of the behaviors from step  are “critical”

to reaching the objective.

. Have the panel rank-order the objectives on the basis of importance.

Th e results of these procedures will yield a set of important objectives and the behaviors necessary to meet them. Th ese behaviors can be used to create employee selection tests, develop training programs, or evaluate the performance of current employees. An example of Ammerman-style objectives and behaviors is shown in Figure ..

Observing Incumbents. Observations are useful job analysis methods, especially when used in conjunction with other methods such as interviews. During a job analysis observation, the job analyst observes incumbents performing their jobs in the work setting. Th e advantage to this method is that it lets the job analyst

actually see the worker do her job and thus obtain information that the worker may have forgotten to mention during the interview. Th is is especially impor- tant because many employees have diﬃ culty describing exactly what they do; to them, performing their job is second nature and takes little thought. A good demonstration of this point is people’s diﬃ culty in naming the location of keys on a typewriter or the location of gears when they drive. We all type and shift gears without thinking (well, most of us do), but quickly describing to another person the location of the “v” key on our typewriter or “reverse” in our manual transmission is diﬃ cult.

Th e method’s disadvantage is that it is very obtrusive: Observing someone without their knowing is diﬃ cult. Th ink of the jobs at which you have worked: Th ere is seldom any place from which an analyst could observe without being seen by employees. Th is is a problem because once employees know they are being watched, their behavior changes, which keeps an analyst from obtaining an accurate picture of the way jobs are done. When I was in college and working third shift at a bookbinding factory, the company hired an “eﬃ ciency expert” to analyze our performance. Th e expert arrived in a three-piece suit, armed with a stopwatch and clipboard. He stuck out like a sore thumb! You can bet that for the two weeks the eﬃ ciency expert observed us, we were ideal employees (I can even remember calling my supervisor “sir”) because we knew he was watching. Once he left, we went back to being our normal, time-wasting, soda-drinking, wise-cracking selves.

Job Participation. One can analyze a job by actually performing it. Th is technique, called job participation, is especially eﬀ ective because it is easier to understand every aspect of a job once you have done it yourself. Th e technique is easily used when the analyst has previously performed the job. An excellent example would be a supervisor who has worked her way up through the ranks. As men- tioned earlier, the problem with using a supervisor or an incumbent is that neither has been trained in job analysis techniques.

A professional job analyst can also perform an unfamiliar job for a short period of time, although this, of course, is limited to certain occupations that involve quick training and minimal consequences from an error. Brain surgery would probably not be good to analyze using this method.

Th e analyst should spend enough time on the job to properly sample work behavior in addition to job diﬃ culty. Yet spending long periods of time can be very expensive and still not guarantee that all aspects of behavior will be covered. Psy- chologist Wayman Mullins used job participation techniques to analyze the job of a ﬁ reﬁ ghter. Mullins spent two weeks living at the ﬁ re station and performing all the duties of a ﬁ reﬁ ghter. Th e only problem during this two-week period—no ﬁ res. If Mullins had not already had a good idea of what a ﬁ reﬁ ghter did, he would have concluded that the most important duties were sleeping, cleaning, cooking, and playing cards!

Step 2: Write Task Statements Once the tasks have been identiﬁ ed, the next step is to write the task statements that will be used in the task inventory and included in the job description. As shown in Table ., at the minimum, a properly written task statement must con- tain an action (what is done) and an object (to which the action is done). Often, task statements will also include such components as where the task is done, how it is done, why it is done, and when it is done.
