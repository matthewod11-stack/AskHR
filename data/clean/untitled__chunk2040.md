# A Plan for Guidance

Parsons was very much interested in how people chose their life’s work, viewing vocational choice as a form of individual and social efﬁciency, a part of the Progressive ideal. Talking of the subject to students at the Civic Service House, Parsons found many who wanted personal meetings to discuss their vocational futures, so much so that in January 1908, he opened the Vocational Bureau at the Civic Service House under the motto “Light, Information, Inspiration, and Coop- eration” (Brewer, 1942; Watts, 1994).

Parsons’ (1909) own words reﬂect the spirit of the times and the themes that would come to be associated with voca- tional psychology and guidance:

The wise selection of the business, profession, trade, or occupa- tion to which one’s life is to be devoted and the development of full efﬁciency in the chosen ﬁeld are matters of the deepest mo- ment to young men and to the public. These vital problems should be solved in a careful, scientiﬁc way, with due regard to each person’s aptitudes, abilities, ambitions, resources, and limi- tations, and the relations of these elements to the conditions of success than if he drifts into an industry for which he is not ﬁtted. An occupation out of harmony with the worker’s aptitudes and capacities means inefﬁciency, unenthusiastic and perhaps dis- tasteful labor, and low pay; while an occupation in harmony with the nature of the man means enthusiasm, love of work, and high economic values, superior product, efﬁcient service, and good pay. (p. 3)

Parsons’ beliefs were actualized in a program of indi- vidual guidance that he developed based on the triadic formulation of (a) knowledge of oneself, (b) knowledge of occupations, and (c) the relationship between the two. Parsons had to develop many of the methods he used or bor- row from questionable practices such as physiognomy and phrenology. The matching of self and job traits retained pop- ular appeal, and Parsons earned a place of historical distinc- tion (Baker, in press). The legacy was shortened by Parsons’ premature death in 1908.
