## While our research oﬀers valuable insights into how supervisors can

best utilize employee monitoring technology, it does not suggest that developmental electronic monitoring is universally eﬀective. As

previous research strongly indicates, certain forms of monitoring can be

highly invasive and may result in a loss of personal agency. Employers run the risk of their monitoring eﬀorts backﬁring, undermining the

very beneﬁts they aim to achieve, such as increased productivity and

reduced deviant behavior, if the monitoring is excessively intrusive and

controlling. Our points relate simply to steps organizations and their

supervisors can take to avoid costly losses associated with monitoring.

In addition to preparing supervisors to use monitoring technology in a

developmental manner, employers should consider the broader context

in which monitoring is introduced. Existing research suggests that

employees are much more likely to accept monitoring and not respond

adversely if they already believe their employer is generally fair.

Companies frequently cast supervisors as passive participants in the

monitoring process, merely tasked with observing and regulating

employee behavior. This type of messaging can pose risks, both to the overall eﬀectiveness of the monitoring process and the relationships

these supervisors have with their subordinates. To address these

risks, organizations that rely on employee monitoring should make

thoughtful choices in how they conduct monitoring and ensure that

supervisors are adequately prepared to utilize the collected information
