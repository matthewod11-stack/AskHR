The concept of a circular economy (CE) can be summed up in the expression "reduce, reuse, and

recycle," which aims to strike a balance between promoting economic development and

preserving the natural environment. It attempts to circumvent the inherent flaws of a straight

business model, defined as "take, make, use, and dispose of" (EC, 2015). We need to move

toward a new "circular" paradigm based on reducing, reusing, and recycling resources. This

approach facilitates the closure of the loop in economic systems, thereby generating

environmental and economic advantages across various levels of analysis, as stated by EC (2015)

(EEA, 2016). At the organizational level, the implementation of Circular practices (CP) is facilitated

by various behaviors, such as the prioritization of regenerative resources, the conversion and

elimination of waste, the design of durable and reassembled products, and the integration of

products and services in 'product-service-systems' (PSS). These practices offer significant

opportunities for cost savings and revenue generation (Stahel, 2013). To use the CE framework,

businesses need to make significant changes to their strategies and develop entrepreneurial skills
