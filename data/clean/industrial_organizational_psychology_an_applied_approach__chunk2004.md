# Job Expectations

A discrepancy between what an employee expected a job to be like and the reality of the job can affect motivation and satisfaction. For example, a recruiter tells an applicant how much fun employees have at a particular company and about the “unlimited potential” for advancement. After three months on the job, however, the employee has yet to experience the fun and can’t find any signs of potential advancement opportunities. Because these expectations have not been met, the employee will probably feel unmotivated.

Employees compare what the organization promised to do for them (e.g., provide a computer, support continued education) with what the organization actually does. If the organization does less than it promised, employees will be less motivated to perform well and will retaliate by doing less than they promised (Morrison & Robinson, ).

As you can guess from these examples, it is important that applicants be given a realistic job preview (RJP) (a concept that you no doubt remember from Chapter ). Though being honest about the negative aspects of a job may reduce the applicant pool, it decreases the chances of hiring a person who will later lose motivation or become dissatisfied.

A good example of this comes from an employee who works for a public men- tal health agency. Prior to accepting her current job, she had worked in the public sector for ten years in a variety of administrative positions. She was excited about her new opportunity because it was a newly created position with what appeared to be excellent opportunities for personal growth. After a year, however, it became clear that the position was clerical, had no opportunity for advancement, and the most important decision she could make involved whether to order pizza or sand- wiches for executive meetings. To make matters worse, this aspiring professional was asked to shop for food to serve at meetings and then serve the food to the managers. As you can imagine, she was deeply disappointed and angry at hav- ing been misled. Because her role as a single mother did not allow her to quit her job, she vented her dissatisfaction by buying stale doughnuts for breakfast meetings, letting the coffee get cold, and “forgetting” to bring mayonnaise for her supervisor’s sandwich—behaviors that could not get her fired but allowed her in a passive-aggressive manner to maintain some form of control in her work life.
