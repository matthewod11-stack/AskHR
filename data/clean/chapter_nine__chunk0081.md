The concept effective workplace culture is not mature and data retrieved from the literature for the proposed enabling factors, attributes and consequences was predominantly implicit. Whilst some components of the framework are well developed concepts e.g. transformational leadership (Bass et al., 2006) and person-centredness (McCormack, 2004; Dewing, 2004), others are less developed e.g. organisational readiness, or there is contention about how they are measured for example, individual, team, organisational effectiveness, human flourishing. We would also assert that there is a need to consider what happens when organisations are not ‘ready’ to take on development to enable an effective work place culture.

The resulting framework challenges us to move our gaze from organisational and corporate culture to the culture of the workplace because it is at this level that the patient/practitioner interface occurs. Whilst there is an interdependence between corporate, organisational and workplace culture, it is the workplace culture that is experienced by patients, users and staff - it is at this level that most potential exists for transformation that benefits all.
