## HBR / Magazine Article / The Power of Words

But when we seek creativity or memorability, a common vernacular

isn’t always a good thing. Tired marketing copy or predictable slogans,

for example, are easy to forget. When unexpected words are assembled

in a distinctive way, they stick. That’s why the musical Hamilton was

such a hit, Berger notes; its style diverged from what theatergoers were

used to.

Berger’s book reinforces my belief as an editor—and should remind

us all—that there’s value in thinking deeply about each word we use:

how it expresses a particular concept or nuance and how people from

diﬀerent geographies, cultures, and backgrounds might experience it.
