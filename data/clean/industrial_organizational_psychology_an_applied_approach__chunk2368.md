# Exercise . in your workbook.

Culture As shown in Table ., workers in different countries have different levels of job satisfaction. Data from the International Social Survey Program indicate that of  countries surveyed, employees in Denmark were the most satisfied and employees in Hungary the least. U.S. employees ranked th in the survey, and employees in Great Britain ranked th (Sousa-Poza & Sousa-Poza, ). In a study of , employees in  countries by FDS International (FDS, ), employees in the UK and Ireland had the highest levels of job satisfaction () and employees in South America () and Asia () the lowest.

Intelligence In , a police department in New London, Connecticut, created controversy when it announced that applicants who were “too smart” would not be hired (see the Chapter  “On the Job” box). The police chief’s reasoning was that really smart people would be bored and have low job satisfaction. Though there has been little research on the topic, a study by Ganzach () suggests that bright people have slightly lower job satisfaction than do less intelligent employees in jobs that are not complex. In complex jobs, the relationship between intelligence and satisfac- tion is negligible. A meta-analysis of seven studies by Griffeth, Hom, and Gaert- ner () found that intelligence and turnover were not significantly related.
