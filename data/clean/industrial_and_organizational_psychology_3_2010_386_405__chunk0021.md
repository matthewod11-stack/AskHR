the alternative with the highest expected value of success (Maule & Svenson, 1993). However, Tversky and Kahneman (1974, 1981) have demonstrated that people’s choices cannot be modeled perfectly by subjective expected utility theory. Speciﬁ- cally, apparent shortcomings in cognition (e.g., insensitivity to base rates) lead people to rely on several heuristics (e.g., avail- ability), which lead to systematic errors. Although Tversky and Kahneman’s research on heuristics and biases is among the JDM research best known to IOOB researchers and practitioners, perhaps less well known is the fact that this program of research has not gone unchallenged by JDM researchers. In particular, Gigerenzer (1996) argues that heuristics are adaptive in an evolutionary sense and that the putative biases owe less to deﬁcient human cognition and more to deﬁcient research design on the part of researchers who argue for the existence of these biases. The bottom line from this debate remains that, although heuristics are efﬁcient they require little time or effort) and although they are often accu- rate, they can sometimes result in spectac- ularly ineffective decisions (Doherty, 2003; Gigerenzer, 1996; Kahneman & Tversky, 1996).
