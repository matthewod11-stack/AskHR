## HBR / Digital Article / Competing in the New Era of Industrial Policy

Global commerce has entered an era where competition is directly—and

profoundly—shaped by government industrial policy.

It used to be that legislative agendas and macro policy issues like

trade policies or environmental initiatives were long-cycle issues about

which executives could say, “Oh, let’s see what happens in the next G7

meeting.” They no longer have that luxury. We’ve come a long way, in what seems a very short time, from the days when U.S. oﬃcials could be

counted on to proclaim that it was not the job of government to “pick

winners and losers” or when leaders of advanced economies routinely

and sincerely said government policy should simply work to ensure a

“level playing ﬁeld.”

Focused or fuzzy, brilliant or bone-headed, industrial policies are here.

Business leaders thus need to know how government aﬀects their

organizations—that is, how industrial policy might endanger value

creation, strengthen it, or create opportunities to expand it.
