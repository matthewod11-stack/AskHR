Conduct a listening tour. Meet with other startup cofounders—people

who are not candidates for joining your team but who’ve been through

the courtship process. Ask what traits they value most in their partners,

what hurdles they had to overcome early in their relationship, and what

red ﬂags to be on the lookout for. Even the greatest cofounding teams

have war stories about stressful times in their relationships and what

they learned from them.
