regarding decision quality is often unavail- able, delayed, or ignored; thus, the inap- propriate strategies used by experienced decision makers frequently need to be ‘‘unfrozen’’ (by demonstrating their poten- tial for error) before improvement can occur (Bazerman & Moore, 2008). Strategies that involve warning the decision maker about bias and identifying the direction of the bias are also ineffective (Fischhoff, 1982). Even extensive training involving personalized feedback appears to be at best moderately effective (Fischhoff, 1982).

Instead, judgments and choices can be improved via one or more of the following evidence-based strategies:

- 1. Making a concerted effort to consider the beneﬁts of adopting courses of action other than the favored one (Bazerman & Moore, 2008; Larrick, 2004).

- 2. Reasoning analogically by identifying similarities and differences across decisions rather than treating each decision as unique (Bazerman & Moore, 2008).

- 3. Taking the average (e.g., median) of the judgments of several (e.g., up to six) expert advisors who are privy to different information and whose judg- ments are consequently uncorrelated (Bonaccio & Dalal, 2006).

- 4. Using simple statistical (e.g., multiple regression) models to ‘‘capture’’ the judgment ‘‘policies’’ of experts and then using these statistical ‘‘models of experts’’ instead of the experts them- selves (because research consistently showsthat,giventhesamesetofinfor- mation, the ‘‘model of the expert’’ outperforms the expert himself or herself; Bazerman & Moore, 2008; Goldberg, 1970; Larrick, 2004). We believe that
