In the follow-up conversation with your boss, acknowledge thecompany’s offer and the difficult financial climate, while alsoreiterating your past accomplishments and future potential forthe company. You might draft a document to share with your bossthat includes your recent successes, references consistent strongperformance reviews, and a note from a senior leader or boardmember about your exceptional work, as well as salary data oncomparative roles.Even after all this, your manager may still say it’s not possible forthe company to consider your raise at this time. If that happens,ask if they’d be willing to revisit the conversation in three to sixmonths. If they agree, add the date to your calendar so you canremember to follow through. If your manager says no outright,remember that money isn’t the only thing that can be negotiated.You may ask instead for other benefits beyond salary, such as aretention bonus, a more flexible schedule, more vacation time,transportation reimbursements, or professional developmentfunds (such as for a conference or coaching).

In a business environment rife with budget constraints and layofffears, asking for additional resources can be complicated. Butthere is never a “perfect” time to ask for a raise — even when theeconomy is strong, many things can get in the way. Economicdownturn or not, don’t let your fear of hearing “no” be one ofthose roadblocks.
