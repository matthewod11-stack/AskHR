Because most job descriptions are ﬁrmly embedded in the employee’s

core area of work, they also tend to encourage silos in the organization

by discouraging cross-functional collaboration. Rigid job descriptions

also discourage experimentation with new technologies that may have

been unimaginable at the time the description was written. And ﬁnally,

narrow job descriptions can mean that an employee isn’t able to fulﬁll

the full range of their talents at work, leaving them dissatisﬁed.

In response, companies are starting to approach job descriptions in new,

more ﬂexible ways based on outcomes, skills, and teams. I’ll describe
