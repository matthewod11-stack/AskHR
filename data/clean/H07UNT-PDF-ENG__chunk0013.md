“Leaders tend to have the expectation that everyone thinks the way

they do,” says Lindsay Dunphy, founder and project management

lead at Fireﬂy Consulting Services. “So they don’t necessarily set the

groundwork for employees to work within the systems they’ve created.

Being able to articulate that expectation can be challenging.”

To prevent confusion, a team can collectively set goals and understand

what it will take to meet key performance indicators (KPIs). Equally

as important is continually re-evaluating these goals. As a project

moves along, is the team meeting expectations? Do the goals still feel

reasonable to achieve? Or is working towards them demoralizing the

team? If the latter, how can you reconﬁgure those goals or adjust

expectations in order to meet those KPIs?
