Incentives can be given for either individual performance or group performance.

Individual Incentive Plans Individual incentive plans are designed to make high levels of individual performance financially worthwhile and the research is clear monetary incen- tives increase performance over the use of a guaranteed hourly salary (Bucklin & Dickinson, ). Individual incentives help reduce such group problems as social loafing, which is discussed in Chapter . There are three main problems associated with individual incentive plans. The first is the difficulty in measur- ing individual performance. Not only are objective measures difficult to find but supervisors are reluctant to evaluate employees, especially when the outcome will determine the amount of money an employee will receive (Schuster & Zingheim, ).

The second problem is that individual incentive plans can foster competition among employees. Though competition is not always bad, it is seldom consis- tent with the recent trend toward a team approach to work. When done right, however, team environments and individual incentive programs can coexist and result in high levels of employee performance (Steers & Porter, ). The third problem is that for an incentive plan to effectively motivate employees, it is essen- tial that employees understand the incentive system. Surprisingly, only % of employees report that they understand how their pay is determined (Grensing- Pophal, ).
