Recognition Rather than providing financial incentives, many organizations reward employee behavior through recognition programs. For example:

United Airlines holds a special ceremony each year in which employees are given service emblems for each year of service. Supermarket chain Dierbergs in St. Louis has initiated a program called Extra Step, which recognizes employees who meet customers’ needs. Over a five-year period, the Extra Step program resulted in a decline in turnover from % to %. Most universities award faculty members the titles of associate professor and professor to recognize years of service as well as quality of performance. Restaurants such as Outback Steak House and Chi-Chi’s Mexican Restaurant give employees of the month a personal parking space. Lee Memorial Hospital in Cape Coral, Florida, gave employees a customized keychain that said: “Valued employee since . . .” with the year they were hired printed at the end (Leonard, ).

In some organizations, recognition awards are given by peers. For example, employees at the Angus Barn Restaurant in Raleigh, North Carolina, choose peers to receive the “People’s Choice” award; employees at Meridian Travel in Cleveland vote for the employee of the month; and employees at the federal Office of Person- nel Management select peers to receive the “Wingspread Award” (Nelson, ).

Informal recognition programs, called social recognition, can prove to be tremendous sources of employee motivation. Social recognition consists of per- sonal attention, signs of approval (e.g., smiles, head nods), and expressions of appreciation (Stajkovic & Luthans, )

Travel Many organizations are offering travel awards rather than financial rewards. For example, every executive at McDonald’s is allowed to nominate high-performing employees for a chance to spend a week in one of the company’s condos in Hawaii, Florida, or Lake Tahoe, Nevada. At Chick-fil-A, sales teams compete for a vacation in Hawaii. At Motorola, managers can nominate employees for travel awards.
