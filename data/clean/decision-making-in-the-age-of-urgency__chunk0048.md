# Our survey methodology

The online survey was in the field from February 13 to February 23, 2018, and garnered responses from 1,259 participants in 91 countries, all of whom are members of McKinsey’s Online Executive Panel. Of those respondents, 1,228 said they were familiar with at least one decision type at their organizations; only those who were familiar with decision making answered the full survey and are included in the results. By and large, the sample reflects the panel’s overall characteristics. The largest pro- portion of respondents (36 percent) are located in Europe, followed by those in North America (25 percent), and no single industry represents more than 15 per- cent of the total responses. Forty percent of respondents work in the general- management or strategy functions, and the sample skews toward upper man- agement: one-third of respondents are C-level executives, and 35 percent are senior managers. A slight majority (55 percent) work for privately owned companies, while nearly one-third work for publicly owned firms, and 62 percent are at companies with annual revenue of less than $1 billion.

Unweighted data were used in our analyses, which included a range of statistical techniques. For instance, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to identify related practices within each decision type, and logistic regression was used to deter- mine the impact of each practice on the probability of being a decision- making winner.

To determine which organizations were decision-making winners, based on the survey responses, we created an index of three outcomes of decision making:

- 1. Decision speed. Respondents say the

average speed of their organizations’ decision making is “about right” or “too fast,” as opposed to “far too slow,” “too slow,” or “far too fast.” For big-bet and cross-cutting decisions, this also includes respondents who say the average speed at which their organizations execute decisions is “about right” or “too fast,” as opposed to “far too slow,” “too slow,” or “far too fast.”1

- 2. High quality of decisions.

Respondents “agree” or “strongly agree” that the decisions made by their organizations (or their senior executives, in the case of big bets) are consistently of high quality.

- 3. Superior market performance.

Respondents say their organizations’ rate of revenue growth in the past three years is “much higher,” “higher,” or “about the same” as that of their industry peers, as opposed to “much lower” or “lower.” For big-bet and cross-cutting decisions, this also includes respondents who say the aver- age financial returns from their decisions are “far above average,” “above average,” or “average” compared with the average returns of their peers’ decisions. Big-bet and cross-cutting respondents are considered winners if they meet one or both of these criteria.

Of the total sample, 20 percent (or 234 respondents) qualified as winners.

1 The question on organizations’ speed at executing decisions was asked only of respondents who answered the survey with respect to big-bet or cross-cutting decisions.
