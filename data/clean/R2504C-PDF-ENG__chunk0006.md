in processes. And pretty soon you have process upon process upon

process, which slows people down, so they can’t get the real work

done. You have to be scrappy. You can’t put 50 or 100 people on every

new project. We started our cloud-computing business, Amazon Web

Services, with about 13 employees. With a small number of people,

you can build something that resonates with customers and then keep

Most companies that are successful for any period of time have a culture

that’s a key part of their success. We have a really strong culture, but

it’s not our birthright. Things change. The size of the company changes.

The scope of businesses you’re going after changes. The geographic
