As an in-house executive and now as a CEO coach, I’ve had to remind

some leaders that although they have been living with the tough news for a while and may be ready to move on, the layoﬀs are a raw wound for

the rest of the organization. Creating space for questions demonstrates

transparency and openness from leadership, which can build trust with

employees. Allowing for honest discussion can address concerns and

anxiety, provide clarity and understanding, and foster engagement and

ownership by employees when they feel that their voices are heard
