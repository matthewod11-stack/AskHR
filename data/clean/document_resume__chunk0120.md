If there is a state fair employment practices agency, the EEOC must defer to that agency before beginning its on investi- gation, The deferral agency may process and settle the charge. If the charge is not settled, or the agency waives jurisdiction; the EEOC will re-assume jurisdiction. The EEOC will first invite the employer to attend a "no-fault" conference to resolve the If, in the opinion of the EEOC representative, the charge has merit, there If the charge is found to be without merit, the
