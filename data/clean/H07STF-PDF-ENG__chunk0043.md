## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

Don’t do all of it all at the same time, but pick a few things. The thing

is we don’t make time for it because, just like in your example, you’re

waiting for stuﬀ to come to you. These are things that you need to take

the initiative on, but it’s very easy.

A great one is to just pick a few people you’ve lost track of, connect to

them, write to them, say, “Hey, I’m thinking about this. It’d be great to

catch up with you and have a conversation about it. How about it?” Very

easy to do. It’s just that we don’t.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I want to come back to one thing you talked about, which was constant

learning, constant adaptation. I think a lot of us are trained to get that

next job, and then we have it and we bring our old selves.

I thought it was interesting that you’re saying we need to continually

evolve and that authenticity is an elastic concept in that sense.

OK, we’re in a role as a leader, middle manager, whatever. How do we

adapt? How do we evolve? How do we not just get stuck in that routine

that we bring from day one? How do we keep evolving?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

There’s a life cycle to all of this. One thing I would say is you’ve just

started a new role. I wouldn’t worry about reinventing yourself. You’ve

been hired for who you are. Exploit that and make sure to connect to

the stakeholders and everything else, but you’re not looking to reinvent

yourself here. You’re really looking to leverage everything that you bring
