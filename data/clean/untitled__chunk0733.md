# The Program: Computation

In the information-processing perspective developed by Broadbent, Neisser, and Atkinson and Shiffrin, the notion of processing remained vague. Information itself is passive: It has to be transformed and manipulated in order to effect behavior. This problem was solved by the development of another concept that today we take for granted, the computer program. Again, the idea seems obvious, but did not come into existence until the 1930s in the work of Alan Turing (Hodge, 2000) and John von Neumann (MacRae, 1999).

Previously, all machines, including the calculators built by Blaise Pascal, Gottfried Leibniz, and Charles Babbage, were dedicated, single-purpose machines whose mechanical work- ings deÔ¨Åned the function they carried out. Computers, how- ever, are general-purpose machines, capable of performing a variety of tasks. Their operations are determined not by their mechanical workings but by their programs, a series of in- structions the computer carries out. Because they manipulate information, programs are independent of their physical sub- strate. A program written in BASIC (or any other computer language) will run on any computer that understands BASIC, whatever its physical makeup, whether it be an Apple, PC, or a mainframe. As Turing (1950) pointed out, a human being following a sequence of steps written on slips of paper is functionally equivalent to a computer.

The computational approach to mind was complete and is known in philosophy as functionalism. The mind is essen- tially a computer program implemented in a meat-machine (Clark, 2001) rather than a silicon-and-metal machine. The
