# 502 Ethnic Minorities

Of particular interest was the likelihood of ethnic minori- ties being treated by white therapists in comparison to clients treated by ethnic minority therapists. Non-white therapists in both years reported treating more ethnic minority clients than white therapists, based on those reporting 60% or above of their client population by ethnicity.

Some research indicates preferences for therapists from similar ethnic backgrounds and SES, but studies are incon- clusive (Sue, Zane, & Young, 1994). What these increased numbers may represent is the increased utilization of mental health services by ethnic minority clients due to enhanced services and access of more trained ethnic minority psychol- ogists in 1992.
