## 10.9 LAWS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

In the past few decades, several countries have passed laws prohibiting discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability status, and sexual orientation. For example, the following laws have been passed in the United Kingdom:

- Equal Pay Act of 1970. Aims to give individuals the right to the same contractual pay and benefits as a person of the opposite sex in the same employment.

- Race Relations Act of 1976. Makes it illegal to discriminate against someone on the grounds of color, race, nationality or ethnic or national origins.

- Sex Discrimination Act of 1975. Makes it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of sex, marital status, and gender reassignment in a limited manner.

- Disability Discrimination Act of 1995. Makes it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of disability status.

- Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003. Makes it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation.

- Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003. Makes it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of religion and belief.

Although these laws are not enforced to the same degree throughout the world, their collective goal is that performance management systems focus on measuring performance by assessing job-related factors and not personal, individual characteristics.

Designing a system that is legally defensible is not a difficult goal to achieve, and it is a natural consequence of implementing a system following the recommendations offered in this book. To summarize some of the key issues that have been discussed throughout the book, Table 10.4 lists key recommendations on how to implement a legally sound performance management system.

Two researchers from the United States reviewed 295 different U.S. circuit court decisions regarding litigation involving performance management systems.40 The goal of their study was to understand the factors carrying the most weight in the decisions reached by the court. They investigated various features of the performance manage- ment systems that were challenged in court, including many of the characteristics listed
