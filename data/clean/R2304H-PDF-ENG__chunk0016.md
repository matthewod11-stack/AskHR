## HBR / Magazine Article / Disability as a Source of Competitive Advantage

Famously, the British intelligence service enlisted Alan Turing, who

as one study concluded was most likely on the autism spectrum, to

help crack the code produced by the German Enigma machine during

the Second World War. A brilliant mathematician who was generally

considered the founding father of computer science, Turing later would

become one of the pioneers of artiﬁcial intelligence.

Recently major corporations like SAP, HP, and EY have been

recruiting neurodiverse employees for speciﬁc tasks like quality control,

cybersecurity, and code checking. And the British intelligence service

still hires them too: Its Government Communications Headquarters

unit enlists relatively large numbers of people with dyslexia to analyze

surveillance data, because they’re unusually good at spotting anomalies

that others miss.

Dyslexia and autism aren’t the only disabilities linked with special

talents. Consider the Gran Estación shopping mall, in Bogotá, Colombia,

which employs many people with physical disabilities in a variety

of roles—for example, customer relations. People who want to meet

with someone in customer service are often upset and angry. Disabled

employees seem better able to defuse such emotions, according to

the mall’s general manager. One customer service rep who was in a

wheelchair told us, “As soon as they see me come in, they calm down.”

Her disability has proved to be an advantage in her line of work.

In some jobs aspects of a person’s disability may actually be a good ﬁt

with the tasks at hand. At Gran Estación the team working in elevator

shafts, which often can be very noisy, consists largely of deaf people.

The mall outsources security to a company called Seguridad Burns

de Colombia (now part of the multinational Securitas), which hires disabled people to work as security oﬃcers. A common problem at the

mall is pickpocketing, particularly when it’s crowded. As the managers
