Last year, I worked alongside a major airline’s cleaning crew at a busy

airport. In the airline business, turnaround time is everything. When

you deplane, these workers begin sanitizing the bathrooms, seats, and

ﬂoors. They’re under constant pressure. The team I observed that day

had some of the highest cleanliness scores at the airline, and it didn’t

take me long to ﬁnd out why.
