# HBR / Digital Article / 4 Ways to Meaningfully Support New Mothers Returning to Work…

Each of these four types of allyship were reported as important and

impactful. However, eﬀectively utilizing them is not as straightforward

as simply engaging in these four types of behaviors with every

postpartum mother returning to work. Why? No two postpartum

experiences are the same. As such, each mother needs to be treated

as the expert on what she needs, with allies empowering them to be

transparent and honest about the challenges being faced. As one of

our interviewees, Heather (pseudonyms have been assigned to maintain

the anonymity of participants), noted, “Everything related to childbirth

and rearing is unpredictable and ﬂuid and unique. So, you can’t say,

‘Everybody’s going to do it this way.’ You have to have some ﬂexibility …

This is a highly emotional time and needs evolve. You’d need to feel like

it’s open to communicate and share.” Thus, being an eﬀective ally also

means asking the postpartum mother about her unique challenges and

experiences, and then adapting allyship strategies to her speciﬁc needs.
