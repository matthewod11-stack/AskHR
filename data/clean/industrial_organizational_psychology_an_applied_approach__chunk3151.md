Arbitration. With arbitration, a neutral third party listens to both sides’ arguments and then makes a decision. Within an organization, this neutral party is often the manager of the two employees in conflict. However, if that manager just served as a mediator, then an HR director might be used.

Organizations are increasingly using outside arbitrators to handle discrimina- tion claims by employees. This increase in the use of arbitrators represents orga- nizational attempts to avoid the negative publicity associated with discrimination suits and to reduce the costs that come with lengthy litigation. In , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that employers can require employees to use arbitration rather than litigation (Circuit City Stores v. Adams, ). However, arbitration works best when it is provided as an option rather than being a requirement.

Though mandatory arbitration can be effective, arbitration is more expen- sive than mediation; so much so that mandatory arbitration policies discourage employees from making formal disputes or cause financial hardships if they do (Armour, ).

Arbitration decisions can be either binding or nonbinding. If the decision is binding, the two sides have agreed to abide by the arbitrator’s decision regardless of how displeased one or both sides may be with that decision. If the decision is nonbinding, then one or both sides can reject an unfavorable decision. Even though arbitration can end conflicts quickly, usually neither side is as satisfied with the outcome as both would have been if they had settled the conflict them- selves or used mediation. Employees are most willing to use arbitration when they perceive that a conflict was the result of intentional behavior by another, resolu- tion of the conflict has important consequences, and the conflicting employees are of equal power (Arnold & Carnevale, ).

Some research suggests that performance may drop (Shirreffs & Sommers, ; Sommers, ) and turnover increase (Bretz & Thomas, ) as a result of an arbitrator’s decision. As you might imagine, an individual’s performance is most likely to drop after losing and most likely to improve after winning an arbi- tration hearing (Hauenstein & Lord, ).
