## The role of stigma in employee mental health

According to the authors' meta-analysis of 82 research, job demands were positively correlated with burnout and depressive symptoms, but job resources were adversely correlated with these conditions. According to the author's examination of the literature on various research on employee engagement and mental health, there is a beneficial connection between the two. Particularly, workers who are motivated at work to experience better mental health outcomes, such as higher levels of job satisfaction, reduced levels of stress and despair, and improved overall wellbeing. According to the authors, job stability should be offered by companies to workers in order to support their overall and mental wellbeing. They advise employers to be open with workers about job security difficulties, but they also accept that, in some circumstances, insecurity may be vital for organisational survival and competitiveness. According to the study, prejudice related to mental health problems has a detrimental effect on employees' mental health. As a result, businesses should lessen mental health stigma and raise public awareness of mental health concerns.
