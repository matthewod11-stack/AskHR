# STIMULATING DISCUSSIONS

One of the difﬁculties of our new program design is that there is a signiﬁcant amount of reliance on the instructor to stimulate and maintain discussion. Giving the athletes more responsibility for their own leadership development in each session also means that the athletes must be active and involved participants. Challenging and assisting athletes in their learning rather than directing and telling athletes what to do often takes a more skilled instructor, teacher, and mentor. This task is made especially difﬁcult because instructors have no prior experience with the speciﬁc athletes attending and because the participants are often hesitant to speak up in a new social situation.
