Deﬁne the critical dependencies underlying the hypotheses and

investigate them. Leonardo Del Vecchio, the founder of Luxottica, a

maker of eyeglasses, did this when he came up with a theory about

how to grow the company (although it wasn’t a start-up at the time).

He posited that eyeglasses could be more than a means of vision

correction—they could be a form of fashion. He believed that people

would pay extra for stylish glasses and that some people would purchase

more than one pair and create a wardrobe of eyewear. Before going to

market with his hypothesis, he wanted to explore two uncertainties:

Could Luxottica even produce fashionable eyewear? And could it move

from a market controlled by independent retailers to a more direct-to-

consumer approach? Del Vecchio believed both were possible.

To resolve those uncertainties, Luxottica partnered with fashion houses,

such as Armani, to produce designs, which immediately increased

demand. And the company started to invest in direct marketing to

test its ability to sell to consumers rather than to optometrists. Today

EssilorLuxottica, as it’s currently known, is the world’s largest eyewear

your hypothesis involves, but you should focus on the top few—let’s say
