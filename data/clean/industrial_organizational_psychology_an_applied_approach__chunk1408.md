resulted in higher levels of test performance. Thus, face validity motivates applicants to do well on tests. Face-valid tests that are accepted by applicants decrease the chance of lawsuits (Rynes & Connerley, ), reduce the number of applicants dropping out of the employment process (Thornton, ), and increase the chance that an applicant will accept a job offer (Hoff Macan, Avedon, & Paese, ). The face validity and acceptance of test results can be increased by informing the applicants about how a test relates to job performance (Lounsbury, Bobrow, & Jensen, ) and by administering the test in a multimedia format (Richman- Hirsch, Olson-Buchanan, & Drasgow, ). Acceptance of test results also increases when applicants receive honest feedback about their test performance and are treated with respect by the test administrator (Gilliland, ). But just because a test has face validity does not mean it is valid (Jackson, O’Dell, & Olson, ). For example, have you ever read a personality description based on your astrological sign and found the description to be quite accurate? Does this mean astrological forecasts are accurate? Not at all. If you also have read a personality description based on a different astrological sign, you probably found it to be as accurate as the one based on your own sign. Why is this? Because of something called Barnum statements (Dickson & Kelly, )—statements so general that they can be true of almost everyone. For example, if I described you as “sometimes being sad, sometimes being successful, and at times not getting along with your best friend,” I would probably be very accurate. However, these statements describe almost anyone. So, face validity by itself is not enough. Finding Reliability and Validity Information Over the previous pages, we have discussed different ways to measure reliabil- ity and validity. But even though most of you will eventually be involved with some form of employee testing, few of you will actually conduct a study on a test’s reliability and validity. Consequently, where do you get information about these? There are many excellent sources containing reliability and validity information in the reference section of most university libraries. Perhaps the most common source of test information is the Seventeenth Mental Measurements Yearbook (MMY) (Geisinger, Spies, Carlson, & Plake, ), which contains information about thousands of different psychological tests as well as reviews by test experts. Your library probably has online access to the MMY. Another excellent source of information is a compendium entitled Tests in Print VII (Murphy, Spies, & Plake, ).
