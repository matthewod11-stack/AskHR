# Considerations for policy

Women represent around 70% of the health workforce,

but earn on average 28% less than men. Occupational

segregation (10%) and working hours (7%) can explain most

of this gap, but even when considering “equal work” an

“equal pay” gap of 11% remains. The trend of increasing

participation of women in highly paid occupations is

predicted to narrow this gap by 4% in the coming 20 years.

take concrete action to accelerate participation of women in

highly skilled health occupations. To achieve equal pay for

equal work, the 11% gap needs to be addressed. In line with
