# Levels of Employee Input

When employers talk about “empowering” employees, they seldom intend to let employees make all of the decisions affecting an organization. Instead, they most often want to give employees “more say” in day-to-day activities. Unfortunately, when employees are told that they are being “empowered,” they often apply a

different meaning to the word than that intended by the employer. In fact, one organization that went through a change spent two full meetings with employ- ees to hash out what empowerment should and would mean in that organization! Thus, it might be useful to set aside the word empowerment and talk instead of levels of employee input and control. Let me provide two examples of why levels of input might be a better choice of term than empowerment.

Several years ago, I was hired by a large poultry company to help them design a system to empower their employees. In such situations, my first question is always, “Why do you want to empower your employees?” In this case, the response was that they were implementing a total quality management (TQM) system and were at the stage in which they were supposed to empower employees. In other words, the organization was making a change because the managers thought they were “supposed to do it” rather than because something was actually going wrong. When I asked them if they wanted to actually “empower” their employees to make most of the decisions about their jobs, the company responded that it did not. When I asked what they meant by empower, their response was that they were not sure. I conducted a training workshop in which I discussed the concept of empow- erment and the levels of employee input examined in the following paragraphs. At the end of the workshop, I told them to discuss what they had just learned and make a decision about what level of employee input they wanted their employees to have. It took just a short time for the managers to reach consensus that they wanted their employees at the advisory level, that their employees already had one of the best suggestion/advisory systems in the nation, and that there was no real need to change. In other words, the organization was already “empowering” its employees at the optimal level for that particular industry.

The second example comes from a university setting in which a new presi- dent appointed a number of committees to study such issues as summer school and student recruitment, and “empowered” these committees to make changes to improve the current system. The committees worked diligently for several months and then presented their new systems to the president. After a week of consideration, the president thanked the committees and told them that he appreciated their hard work but had decided not to follow any of their recom- mendations. The committee members were shocked at this response, because, to them, being told they were “empowered” meant that their decisions were final and thus would become the new policy. The president responded by saying that he had empowered them to “study” the issues and make “recommendations.” His intent had never been to allow a committee to make a final decision.

As these two examples demonstrate, empowerment means many things to many people. As shown in Figure ., there are five main levels of employee input and control.

Following Employees at the following level have no real control over their jobs. They are given instructions about what to do, when to do it, and how it should be done. Further- more, their work is often checked by other employees (e.g., quality control) or by their supervisor. Employees at this level can be those who are new or inexperienced to the work being performed or those with weak decision-making skills.

Ownership of Own Product At this level, employees are still told what to do but are solely responsible for the quality of their output. For example, an employee working on an assembly
