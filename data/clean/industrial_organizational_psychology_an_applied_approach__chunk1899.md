Second, each trainee is actively involved in the learning. This contrasts sharply with the lecture method, where the employee might sit through two hours of lecture without being actively involved. Think of your favorite classes: The instructor prob- ably allowed you to become involved and actually do things. (That is why some of the chapters in the text are so detailed. By making the text inclusive and complete, your instructor can spend class time on projects instead of straight lecture.)

Finally, programmed instruction presents information in small units or chunks, because learning smaller amounts of material is easier than learning larger amounts. To demonstrate this point, think of the exam for this class. Would your score on the test be higher if you read and reviewed one chapter each week or if you waited until the night before the test to read five chapters? (The answer is obvious, and hope- fully you did not answer the question from experience!). A meta-analysis by Manson () concluded that programmed instruction can lead to improved performance at relatively low cost, and a meta-analysis by Allen, Mabry, Mattrey, Bourhis, Tits- worth, and Burrell () found that test scores for students in distance learning classes were no different than those earned by students in traditional courses.
