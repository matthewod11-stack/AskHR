# b. Laissez-Faire Management

Laissez-faire managers adopt a hands-off approach, allowing their employees a high degree of autonomy and decision-making authority. This style is particularly effective when dealing with a self-motivated and highly skilled team, such as in creative industries or research and development. While laissez-faire management can foster creativity and innovation, it may lead to challenges in maintaining consistency and coordination, as there is limited centralized control.
