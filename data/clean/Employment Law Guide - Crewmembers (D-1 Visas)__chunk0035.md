# Reporting

There are no reporting requirements.

When violations are found, the Wage and Hour Division may assess a civil money penalty not to exceed $5,000 per crewmember

employed in violation of the D-1 visa requirement, and other appropriate remedies. Any interested party may request a hearing on the Wage and Hour Administrator's determination before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), and any interested party may petition

the Secretary of Labor to review the ALJ's decision.

During an investigation, the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division may enter a "cease and desist" order against the

employer. When the Administrator issues a "cease and desist" order, an employer must discontinue the activities speciÔ¨Åed in the

determination, including the use of D-visa crewmembers in a manner inconsistent with the determination. Vessels owned or chartered by an employer found in violation of this program will not be allowed to enter U.S. ports for up to one year, and may be

precluded from future access to the D-1 program for up to one year.
