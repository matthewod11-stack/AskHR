# 4.1 Ethics and Other Considerations

Challenges in the use of Predictive PA are argue to benefit companies and yield advantages for

employees through various functionalities. In its most effective implementation, analytics aids

in the identification of talent that might otherwise go unnoticed. This, in turn, fosters a more

equitable reward system and empowers employees by facilitating enhanced workplace

retention. Overall, it ensures employee satisfaction, engagement, and optimal performance as

it becomes more recognizable with evidence.

On the other hand, many authors criticize the nature of PA and point out its unethical side and

risk of being misused. For instance, Schiemann et al. (2017) raise concern about People

analytics as a <backward looking=, when collecting historical data on employee background

and their performance. To have a good grasp of the future scene, it requires organizations to

poccess a very wide variety of skills to leverage historical data. Furthermore, in an

organizational context the provision the actionable insight extracted from data does not

guarantee the buy-in of decision makers, whether insights are taken into consideration or

implemented in actual action.

There are more risks beyond the question of PA in general and Predictive Analysis. According

to Giermindl et al. (2021), there are four prime challenges that organizations should take into

consideration while employing PA.

First challenge to be mentioned by the authors (Giermindl et al, 2021) is the utilization of PA

to monitor workplace behavior raises ethical and moral questions that demand careful

consideration. There are concerns over data privacy related to collected data's content, usage,

and access. The second concern is transparency. Transparency and informed consent are crucial

in maintaining ethical standards. The third concern is data quality, as the trained dataset has a

significant impact on the algorithm. Ensuring data accuracy and fairness in algorithms is a

significant ethical challenge. Second challenge is the application of algorithms to control

human actions has substantial implications for organizational dynamics, feasibility, societal

effects, and workplace ethical standards. These consequences are not thoroughly explored and

need proper examination and resolution. The third challenge raised by the authors is the

behavior of humans is generally highly complex, often shaped by complex factors such as

emotions, culture, and personal experiences. Handing the interpretation of human behavior to

an algorithm may result in overlooking the intricate nature of human factors. These

misinterpretations may lead to financial costs to the business. Last but not least, PA can be

intrusive and may violate employees' data protection and privacy rights due to excessive data

collection and lack of transparency in data usage. Continuous monitoring may create an

atmosphere of constant surveillance, impacting employeeâ€™s sense of autonomy and freedom
