# Alternatives to Scaling

We recently worked with Blue Hill at Stone Barns, one of the world’s

top restaurants, to understand how they are trying to rearchitect the

food industry to support life and nutrition in the long run. Their biggest

challenge in getting attention in the business world for an approach as

audacious as Space X or Tesla? Critics who immediately dismiss it with

the question, “Does it scale?” Ironically, one of the challenges Blue Hill

faces is to reinvent the food industry to be smaller, rather than bigger.

In an ecological community, a system that integrates multiple types of

crops, animals, and systems works better with nature and provides more

nutrients and long-term viability. So what are the alternatives to our

traditional view of scaling? Here is what leaders may want to consider as

they think about their reasons for taking a given path.
