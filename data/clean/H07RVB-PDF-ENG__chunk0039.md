# HBR / Digital Article / Jim Fielding, Ex-Head of Disney Stores, on the Struggles of Mak…

a successful CEO looks like. And I’m not sure that all the reasons we do

that are authentic.

Listen, if you want to drive a super expensive car and that gives you joy,

go for it, if that’s your authenticity. But if you’re doing it because you’re

seeking external validation or someone giving you a thumbs up saying,

“That’s a really cool car,” and you somehow get better feelings out of

that, I think that’s where you have to look inward and say, “What are my

true motivations for doing this?”

And I think it’s a little bit of my Midwestern-ness, a little bit of my dad,

God bless him, I still talk to him every day, even though he has been

gone 11 years, who was so Midwestern and so frugal and not wrapped

up in external trappings. Still, every time I buy something expensive, I

still hear him in my head saying, “Do you really need that? I don’t really

think you need that. Okay, you need a new watch. Do you really need the

Rolex? I think the Timex is ﬁne.” I can totally hear him saying that.

But if it’s something I’m doing for me and I’m comfortable in that for

me, that’s great. If I’m doing it because I want other people to say, “Oh,

that’s an amazing watch,” that’s a problem. That’s a warning sign.

ADI IGNATIUS:

That’s a brand identity too, the non-branded brand identity.
