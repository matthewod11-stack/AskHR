# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

judgements; for example, when it comes to retrieving relevant studies and the coding of data.

To reduce issues related to the former, we conducted an exhaustive search of studies on

leadership and trust in the leader. Second, to address coding issues, a proportion of the data

was double coded to minimize judgement impacts. Despite these efforts, these limitations

may have unintentionally influenced the findings. On a related note, we recognise that some

of the comparisons drawn in our analysis were based on relatively small numbers of studies

and, in these instances, results should be interpreted with some caution.

Another limitation acquired from the empirical literature is that of causal inference. A

large proportion of the studies on trust in leaders have been conducted cross-sectionally with

only a handful of time-lagged designs (e.g., Newman et al., 2014; Zhang & Zhou, 2014) or

experimental (Hoyt & Blascovich, 2003). This limits our ability to demonstrate causality in

the relationship between leadership styles, trust and performance outcomes. In addition,

McAllister (1995) argues that cognitive trust is a necessary precondition for the development

of affective trust. Typically, however, trust is captured as a static variable rather than a

dynamic construct which changes over time. Further research is therefore required to

investigate these relationships using longitudinal and experimental methods to more

accurately account for the issue of time. Despite this, a strength of our meta-analysis was that

we only focused on other-rated outcomes for performance and OCB. This goes some way in

helping alleviate concerns regarding common method variance (Podsakoff et al., 2003).

It is important to consider our meta-analytic findings in relation to the wider leadership

literature. The literature has been subject to high profile critiques regarding the

conceptualisation, measurement and study design (e.g., Antonakis et al., 2010; Hughes et al.,
