# Where the Organization Has Been

Since its founding, HBR has sought answers to fundamental questions

such as these: What’s the best way to organize a business? What is the

right structure, and how should day-to-day decisions be made?

About a century ago Henry Ford had a world-changing answer to

these questions. He built a business around top-down management

and assembly line mass production. By standardizing his automobiles

and the steps taken to manufacture them, he lowered the cost per unit

across the entire end-to-end value chain. That innovation, combined

with his decision to raise workers’ pay to $5 per day, was adopted by

other companies. This change drove industrial activity — making it

possible for millions more people to own and enjoy everything from

cars to Coca-Cola — and raised living standards around the world. Even

as Ford’s company grew, though, its structure remained the same: a

hierarchy in which business decisions were made in the C-suite and

functions reported up to the president and chief executive.
