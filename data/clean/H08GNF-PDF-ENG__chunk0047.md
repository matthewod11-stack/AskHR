# delivery timeline.

Task: I had to resolve the conﬂict and ensure that the project

remained on track.

Action: I actively listened to each team member’s concerns,

understood their perspectives, and translated complex ideas into

language everyone could understand. I realized everyone was using

the term “platform,” but it had different meanings in different

countries and, therefore, the work wasn’t consistent. I was able to

leverage my unique strength of being proﬁcient in six languages to

bridge the communication gap. Further, my unique understanding of

the cultural nuances of each team member allowed me to build trust

and foster a collaborative environment.
