of individuals in expressing the behavioral tenets of theory. However, there have been calls from scholars to consider the board as a collective unit or the ‘board as team’ as the unit of analysis to try to better understand the impact of the board on corporate outcomes. This is reﬂected in the surge of recent work on teamwork in contexts as an empirical inquiry of the sparsely-researched link between board dynamics and governance (Huse et al, 2011). Confounding the lack of clarity on board-level antecedent relationships to ﬁrm-level outcomes is the recognition that most research conducted employs secondary- source data or ‘easily available data and the use of standardized methods’ (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004), preempting efforts to gather primary data on the subject. Of the hundreds of articles written about board governance since 1990, only 8 per cent address director performance from a behavioral perspective (Huse et al, 2011), and of these only a few have produced original their quantitative analyses survey data (Minichilli et al, 2012). For all these reasons – the preponderance of theoretical frameworks, difﬁculty in accessing primary data and deﬁning the most appropriate unit of analysis – scholars refer to the board as a ‘black box’ (Pettigrew and McNulty, 1995; Leblanc and Schwartz, 2007; Neill and Dulewicz, 2010) and scholarly works have not yet succeeded in lifting the shroud of boardroom mystery.
