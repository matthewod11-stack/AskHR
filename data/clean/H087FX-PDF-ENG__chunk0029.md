# patients after exertion.

When people with long Covid exceed their energy capacity, symptoms

can often worsen, sometimes severely, as with PEM. Those in chronic

illness communities often describe this phenomenon using the “spoon

theory.” Imagine that every exertion costs you a spoon of energy. Taking

the subway to work? Fifteen spoons. Sitting upright at your desk or

attending a meeting? Ten spoons. While a healthy person may have

unlimited spoons to use, people with complex chronic illnesses often

have a ﬁnite number. Importantly, patients with severe illness may have

very few to almost no spoons, whereas patients with mild illness have

more. However, if they exceed their allotment, their symptoms ﬂare.
