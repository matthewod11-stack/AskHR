Don’t be afraid to negotiate. When the organiza- tion makes an off er, counter with a higher amount. In doing so, be realistic and base your off er on logic and facts. Explain why you think an increased starting salary is justifi able. If you graduated with no experience and a 2.01 GPA, you probably have little room to negotiate above the bottom of the range.

When the job market is tight and employers are having trouble fi nding good applicants, your value is higher. In addition to salary, there are times when you can negotiate such things as vacation time, starting dates, and other benefi ts.

the diﬀ erences (e.g., the economy at the time of hire) that were not entered into the regression. However, in the absence of a valid explanation, salary adjustments may be in order.

Salary adjustments are determined by entering the merit variables for each employee into a regression equation to estimate what the employees “should” be making. For this approach to be reliable, the merit variables should account for a sta- tistically signiﬁ cant percentage of the individual diﬀ erences in salary. An employee whose actual salary is two standard errors below his or her predicted salary is a potential candidate for a salary adjustment. I realize that this process is compli- cated and highly statistical, but that is the nature of salary equity analysis, and salary equity analyses are becoming an important function performed by human resources departments. Th e process can be made substantially easier by using software such as HR Equator or Equipay, which are designed for such purposes.
