# disagreements.

Our ﬁndings indicate that high-performing teams are more likely

to believe that workplace disagreements lead to better decisions (as

opposed to damaging relationships). They also rate their teammates as more eﬀective at preventing disagreements from getting personal.

These two observations are likely connected. A workplace disagreement

can be perceived as an opportunity or a threat, and our interpretation

inﬂuences the way we respond. Among high-performing teams, viewing

conﬂict as a source of strength makes disagreement less harrowing,

reducing the frequency with which colleagues lash out.
