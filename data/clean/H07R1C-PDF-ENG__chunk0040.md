## ﬂexible schedules, and demand remote and hybrid work environments.

Perhaps if companies recognized the beneﬁts of hiring and retaining

caregivers, men would be more likely to take advantage of the available

policies because it would be culturally acceptable to do so. Then people

of all genders could continue to work toward professional goals without

sacriﬁcing their caregiving responsibilities.

Which brings us back to James. Until recently, James couldn’t imagine

that he would be able to balance caregiving and work in the ﬁnance

sector. He explained:

In the ﬁnance world, ﬂexibility was just not an option. If you wanted

to work in this industry, you had to give up ﬂexibility. But now

having an employer who understands the need to do caregiving

work has opened my mind to what is possible. And it is an amazing

experience. For [my parents, my kids] and also for me. And now, I’m

a role model for my colleagues. People see me as someone who has

learned to effectively balance work and home.
