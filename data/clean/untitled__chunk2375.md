# 424 School Psychology

IOC has been an effective vehicle for several collaborative efforts between these organizations.

Although NASP was a dominant force in many areas and held a commanding membership representation of school psychologists (perhaps 70%), the Division of School Psy- chology continued to be an important representative of school psychology to the broader arena of American psychology within the APA. In addition, the division was the dominant force in doctoral-level program accreditation and advocacy efforts exclusively on behalf of doctoral school psychology. By the 1990s, the NASPandAPADivision 16 had achieved a more comfortable relationship, despite their major policy differences (Fagan, Gorin, & Tharinger, 2000).

With the assistance of NASP, state associations for school psychologists thrived. While there were just 17 associations at the end of the Hybrid Years, there were at least 50 by the late 1990s, almost all of which had formally afﬁliated with NASP. In almost every state, two systems of organizational representation now existed via the state psychological associ- ation and the state school psychological association. In a few states, the school psychology afﬁliate was a part of the state psychological association. In most states, however, they were entirely separate and often in bitter competition over practice privileges and credentialing. Every state’s psycho- logical association was afﬁliated with the APA. The network of NASP state afﬁliates allowed the NASP a ready avenue for promoting its positions, products, and advocacy efforts throughout the country. The Division of School Psychology had little or no effectiveness in doing this because state psychological associations did not afﬁliate directly with APA divisions, and in most states few school psychologists belonged to the state psychological association. The differ- ences in the effectiveness of such networks for the NASP and the division were observable in the aftermath of their jointly sponsored futures conferences in 1980 and 1981 (see Brown, Cardon, Coulter, & Meyers, 1982; Ysseldyke & Weinberg, 1981).

Organizational developments outside the United States were also occurring. Originating in the early 1970s, the inter- national school psychology movement led to the establish- ment of the International School Psychology Association in 1982. Relatedly, the Canadian Association of School Psy- chology (CASP) was founded in 1985. Both groups conduct annualmeetingsandhaveafﬁliateorganizations(seeFagan& Wise, 2000, chapters 9 and 10).
