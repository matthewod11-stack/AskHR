# Evolution of Employee Experience

Today we can’t imagine a life without a notebook, a car, internet, or phones. But

decades ago, the relationship between employer and employee was straightforward.

Employers had a job to be done, the employee had a bills to be paid and certain level

of abilities or skills they could offer to employer. There was no focus on getting people

involved, inspiring them, giving them power, making their workplaces look nice, using

modern technology, or anything of that sort. Typically, the workplace was fixed place

with a computer or notepad with a pen. In the past, people specialized in one area,

so for them was enough just to have a hammer and nails. Usually, it was a job for

one’s whole life. Jacob Morgan in his book The Employee Experience Advantage

identifies four different employment era’s (Morgan, 2017). The first one, already

described, is Utility. After the utility era came the Productivity era. In this era, we could

see the first attempts to optimize how employees worked. Everything was designed

to maximize productivity and output, the typical concept being assembly lines.

Basically, managers used stopwatches to measure every single process and how

much time it takes to complete each task. At that time, there were no robots which

would be better suited to this productivity era. As in the Utility era, there was little focus

on employee feelings or design of comfortable workplaces. In both, productivity and

output were the only focus areas.
