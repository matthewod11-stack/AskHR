Unimportant. There would be no negative consequences if the task was not performed or if the task was not performed properly.

Important. Job performance would be diminished if this task was not completed properly. Essential. The job could not be performed eff ectively if the incumbent did not properly complete this task.

being performed. For example, consider the task accurately shoots a gun. For a police oﬃ cer, this task occurs infrequently, but when it does, its importance is paramount. If a frequency scale alone were used, shooting a gun might not be covered in training. Although many types of scales can be used, research suggests that many of the scales tap similar types of information (Sanchez & Fraser, ); thus, using the two scales of frequency of occurrence and importance shown in Table . should be suﬃ cient. In fact, rather than asking for ratings of frequency of occurrence or relative time spent on a task, some researchers advise that the task inventory should simply ask, “Do you perform this task?” (Wilson & Harvey, ). Raters tend to agree on ratings of task importance but not on time spent (Lindell, Clause, Brandt, & Landis, ).

After a representative sample of SMEs rates each task, the ratings are organized into a format similar to that shown in Table .. Tasks will not be included in the job description if their average frequency rating is . or below. Tasks will not be included in the final task inventory if they have either an average rating of . or less on either the frequency (F) or importance (I) scales, or an average combined rating (CR) of less than . Using these criteria, tasks , , and  in Table . would be included in the job description, and tasks  and  would be included in the final task inventory used in the next step of the job analysis.
