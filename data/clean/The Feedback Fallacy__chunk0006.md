## approaches of Bridgewater and Netﬂix, how hard-edged and fearlessly

candid should we be? Behind those questions, however, is another

question that we’re missing, and it’s a crucial one. The search for ways to

give and receive better feedback assumes that feedback is always useful.

But the only reason we’re pursuing it is to help people do better. And

when we examine that—asking, How can we help each person thrive and

excel?—we ﬁnd that the answers take us in a diﬀerent direction.

To be clear, instruction—telling people what steps to follow or what

factual knowledge they’re lacking—can be truly useful: That’s why we

have checklists in airplane cockpits and, more recently, in operating

rooms. There is indeed a right way for a nurse to give an injection safely,

and if you as a novice nurse miss one of the steps, or if you’re unaware

of critical facts about a patient’s condition, then someone should tell

you. But the occasions when the actions or knowledge necessary to

minimally perform a job can be objectively deﬁned in advance are rare

and becoming rarer. What we mean by “feedback” is very diﬀerent.

Feedback is about telling people what we think of their performance

and how they should do it better—whether they’re giving an eﬀective

presentation, leading a team, or creating a strategy. And on that, the

research is clear: Telling people what we think of their performance

doesn’t help them thrive and excel, and telling people how we think

they should improve actually hinders learning.

Underpinning the current conviction that feedback is an unalloyed

good are three theories that we in the business world commonly accept

as truths. The ﬁrst is that other people are more aware than you are of
