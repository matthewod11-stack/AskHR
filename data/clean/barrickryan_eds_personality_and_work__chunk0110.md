# 18 PERSONALITY AND WORK

components of seven broad factors, as are the forty-four homoge- neous item composites from the HPI. The CPI (Gough, 1996) has an open-ended number of middle-level constructs, since new ones can always be generated from the inventory’s large item pool.

These middle-level facet systems appear to converge only par- tially; rarely are the same labels used for similar constructs. Because personality inventories are so widely employed, the high degree of divergence at the scale level, at least in terms of labels for the con- structs, creates a scientiﬁc problem. Indeed, there is a virtual Tower of Babel with respect to the labels for middle-level constructs; every inventory developer seems to speak a different tongue. Although in numerous studies McCrae and Costa have studied the relations between the scales from various inventories and their own NEO- PI-R, they have concentrated on delineating joint broad factors, not on reconciling the competing sets of constructs found at the more speciﬁc level.

The degree of convergence between the lower-level models em- bodied in various personality inventories is not yet well understood, nor are the relations of these inventory-based models to those de- rived from lexical studies. More research is needed to develop an overarching structure linking the facet systems in various invento- ries and then linking these systems to lexical ﬁndings concerning the general structure of personality attributes. In addition, we should learn more about the degree to which these inventories might reference some useful personality characteristics that are not well captured in personality-descriptive lexicons.

For the industrial/organizational psychologist, the most im- portant question concerns the comparative validity of each of the inventory and lexical models in predicting important human out- comes, especially those involved in the world of work. The manuals for many personality inventories include tables of correlations be- tween its scale scores and various criterion indexes, but virtually all of the ﬁndings from different inventories are incommensurate. Test authors are not encouraged to conduct comparative validity studies, pitting their instrument against one or more others as pre- dictors of the same set of criterion indexes. As a result, neither the science of personality assessment nor its applied practitioners have information about the comparative performance of the different
