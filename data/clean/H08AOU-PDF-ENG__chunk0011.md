# Redistributing Office Housework

Bias in access to opportunities ﬂourishes in the dark: Once you bring

the problem to light, you can’t unsee it. Supported by a generous grant

from Walmart, our team, in partnership with The Conference Board,

administered a 10-minute Workplace Experiences Survey (WES) at four

companies — a professional services ﬁrm, an energy company, and two

ﬁnancial institutions — to establish a baseline level of oﬃce housework

allocation. Next, we ran our unique, interactive 90-minute Individual

Bias Interrupters workshop, then measured three months later to see if the training had an eﬀect. The results were dramatic.
