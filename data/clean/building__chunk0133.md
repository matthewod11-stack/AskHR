# DEPLOY WITH LLM OPS

LLMOps is the set of practices and principles for operationalizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in production environments. Consider it a subset of Machine Learning Ops (MLOps) but specifically focused on the unique challenges of deploying and managing LLMs, such as their large size, complex training requirements, and higher computational demands.

In a survey of 1,400 C-suite executives by BCG, 62% cited a shortage of talent and skills as their biggest challenge when it comes to implementing their AI strategies.3 Training and change management are key to an effective AI deployment.

Every level of the organization needs different AI competencies: C-suite requires strategic vision to lead initiatives, managers need skills to guide teams through transformation, and frontline workers need practical tool proficiency. Understanding these needs enables targeted training programs.

Here are five of the most important best practices for LLMOps:

- 1. Robust monitoring and observability Implementing comprehensive monitoring is foundational to successful LLMOps. This means tracking not just basic metrics like response times and error rates, but also LLM-specific concerns like token usage and output quality. The key is creating a system that gives you visibility into how your LLMs are actually performing in production, allowing you to catch issues before they impact users.

- 2. Systematic prompt management Like code, prompts need version control, testing, and proper documentation. Create a central repository where teams can collaborate on prompts, track changes, and understand why specific prompts were designed the way they were. Implement a testing framework to validate prompts across different scenarios, and maintain clear documentation about each prompt’s purpose and expected behavior.

- 3. Security and compliance by design Build in proper access controls, content filtering, and data privacy measures from the start. Establish clear policies about what data can be used with LLMs and how to handle sensitive information. Regular security audits and compliance checks should be part of your routine operations.

- 4. Scalable infrastructure and cost management Design your LLM infrastructure with scalability in mind, but balance this with cost efficiency. Implement effective caching strategies, choose the right model sizes for different tasks, and optimize token usage. Monitor and analyze usage patterns to identify opportunities for cost reduction without compromising performance.

- 5. Continuous quality assurance This includes regular testing of model outputs, monitoring for hallucinations, and validating responses against your business requirements. Establish feedback loops with end-users and maintain clear processes for addressing quality issues when they arise.

Each of these practices supports the others – for instance, good monitoring helps inform both quality assurance and cost management, while systematic prompt management contributes to better security and quality. The key is implementing them as part of a coherent strategy rather than as isolated initiatives.

“The adoption of GenAI has helped us develop thousands of experiences and itineraries for 80% less cost than it would if we were to have our writers manually curate those. Furthermore, our writers are now freed up to go focus on finding the next in-destination thing and continue to inspire travelers everywhere.”
