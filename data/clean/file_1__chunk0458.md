afterwards. Alternatively, egalitarian gender role orientation allows flexibility for both men and women. By relaxing the gendered separation of work and family, it intends to manage people’s market and domestic household duties (Judge and Livingston, 2008).

Individuals holding traditional gender role orientation tend to follow a traditional division of labour preserving power and superior privilege held by men. They might be less concerned about gender inequalities and the gender pay gap in particular. In contrast, individuals with egalitarian gender role orientation are expected to perceive gender inequalities to a greater extent than others because they are more likely to adjust their attitudes on the basis of evidence they receive rather than on traditional conceptions (Duehr and Bono, 2006). Individuals with egalitarian gender role orientation might be more likely to have learnt or heard about the gender pay gap. Individuals holding traditional gender role orientation are, thus, suggested to perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than members of those groups who possess egalitarian gender role orientation. The following proposition summarizes this reasoning:

Propositions 2: individuals with traditional gender role orientation will perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than individuals with egalitarian gender role orientation.

Perceived pay fairness: if there are general differences in the importance individuals attach to pay fairness, then there might be general differences in the significance they attribute to the gender pay gap. In fact, individuals, who perceive less pay fairness than others, may have less respect for their jobs, be less satisfied with their work in general, and, as a result, they might perceive the gender pay gap to a greater extent than individuals who perceive more pay fairness.

Individuals evaluate pay in relation to some notion of what fair pay ought to be. According to Heneman (1985), perceived pay fairness is a function of the difference between an estimated pay level and what an employee thinks his/her pay should be. Furthermore, according to Adam's (1965) equity theory, individuals scale a variety of factors (e.g. effort, performance) in estimating relevant inputs and outcomes. A person (P) evaluates the fairness of his/her pay level in comparison with other (CO), which is another person or a situation that P has experienced in the past or thinks likely to be in future. P compares his/her own ratio of perceived outcomes (O) (e.g. salary) to perceived inputs (I) (e.g. effort, performance), with the O/I ratio of CO: Op/Ip<,>, or=OCO/ICO? If P's ratio is smaller than the CO's ratio, P feels under-rewarded and vice versa.

Equity theory suggests that in-balance between perceived inputs and outcomes are not motivators and, thus, the theory is more likely to be relevant for studying dark sides of reactions to compensation decisions (Gerhart and Rynes, 2003). Since perceptions of the gender pay gap are one of the less “desirable” employees’ attitudes to pay from the employer's perspective, equity theory is relevant for studying it.

According to the theory, individuals, who perceive themselves as under-rewarded, experience distress and inequity. The greater the inequity, the more distress individuals feel, and the more they attach attention towards pay injustice (Walster, Traupmann and Walster, 1978). Since pay influences behaviour through its effects on individual's attitudes and
