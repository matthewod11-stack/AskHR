In today’s climate, large-scale layoffs are in the news often. The

industry being hit the hardest right now is tech, with more than 100,000

roles being cut in 2024 so far, including from large companies like

Microsoft, Intuit, and Dell. With such high-proﬁle companies making

widespread staﬀ cuts, it’s only natural for leaders to wonder if reducing

headcount might be the answer to their business’s woes, too.
