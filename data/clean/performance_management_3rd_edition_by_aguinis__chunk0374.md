In summary, there are two important prerequisites that must exist before the implementation of a successful performance management system. First, there is a need to have good knowledge of the organization’s mission and strategic goals. This knowledge, combined with knowledge regarding the mission and strategic goals of their unit, allows employees to make contributions that will have a positive impact on the unit and on the organization as a whole. Second, there is a need to have good knowledge of the job in question: what tasks need to be done, how they should be done, and what KSAs are needed. Such knowledge is obtained through a job analysis. If we have good information regarding a job, then it is easier to establish criteria for job success.
