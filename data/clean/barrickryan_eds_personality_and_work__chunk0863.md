# Multilevel Perspective

A multilevel perspective is one of the most important recent trends in our ﬁeld. It represents a paradigm shift from a focus on just the individual or just the organization (or a subunit such as a team or work group) to a perspective that incorporates multiple levels of analysis. The multilevel personnel selection framework that B. Schnei- der and his colleagues (B. Schneider, Smith, & Sipe, 2000; Ployhart & Schneider, 2002) propose exempliﬁes this approach to theory building. New ways of thinking about work—tasks; required knowl- edge, skills, and abilities (predictor constructs, including personality variables); and performance constructs—as well as validation mod- els are required. The research and trends already described for group- level performance variables and group-level personality predictor variables are especially relevant to multilevel research and theories.

Another study highlights the importance of using a multilevel approach to conceptualize, measure, and analyze variables and data. Grifﬁn (2001) hypothesized and found different effects when different levels of analyses were used to examine the effects of sta- ble personality characteristics and work characteristics on worker reactions. Speciﬁcally, between-group variance in worker reaction
