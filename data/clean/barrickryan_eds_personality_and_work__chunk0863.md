# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 313

(see Hough & Furnham, 2003). Subjective methods other than self- report (for example, othersâ€™ reports, descriptions, and observations) are more common, as are objective methods such as conditional rea- soning, a strategy pioneered by James (1998) for measuring per- sonality characteristics based on the logic an individual uses to justify behavior. Although genetic testing (mouth swabs for DNA) is infrequently used, it may become more common. In the United States, however, legislative actions, Equal Employment Opportu- nity Commission guidelines for interpreting the Americans with Disability Act, and case law may preclude its use. Similarly, technol- ogy (digitization) has changed the mode of testing, making new con- structs possible, as well as new modes of measuring existing constructs (for example, response latency to measure extraversion). Testing using virtual reality has yet to come to fruition, but it will. Of course, new constructs and modes of measuring them bring new concerns about construct validity, equivalence, intended and unintended consequences, and new, unforeseen issues.
