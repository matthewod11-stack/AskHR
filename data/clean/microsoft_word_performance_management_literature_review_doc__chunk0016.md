Hurst (2009) discerns two strands in the performance management literature: a very structured and controlled backward-looking review approach which is ‘done’ to employees (Grote, 2000), and a much more inclusive, forward-looking approach involving the individual, supporting their development and linking in to the organisation’s needs and values (Spangenburg and Theron, 2001). But as Cannell (2006) points out, there is still the need for a conversation to both reflect on past performance and to look forward.

The latter is what is largely in the mind of those that advocate a more root and branch change to performance appraisal: a switch to a performance management philosophy that engages employees more in the process and drives performance towards key organisation goals. The concurrent simplification of processes that is underway switches the focus on individual scheme details and towards the essence of the performance management process.

In their book on the subject, Armstrong and Baron (2005) note the shift in terminology from performance appraisal to performance management, which they believe indicates a wider shift in the philosophy and content of the process:

‘Performance appraisal has a reputation as a punitive, top-down control device, an unloved system. Performance Management is a holistic, total approach to engaging everyone in the organisation in a continuous process, to improve everyone and their performance, and thereby the performance of the whole organisation.’

Despite the move to adopt an all-encompassing approach, a recent trend towards simplification is also evident from CIPD research, with better support and training being provided as greater focus is being put on how these systems actually work in the reality of the organisation, rather than in respect of the many intended policy intention and outcomes.

Just under half of the respondents to the CIPD performance management survey (48 per cent) had proposed to make changes to their performance management arrangements over the forthcoming year, with a similar direction evident (CIPD, 2005).

E-reward’s survey (2005) of performance management provides a clear picture of the changes that organisations are making to support the shift towards a performance management approach, but also to address problems such as over- complexity and bureaucracy. More than two-thirds of organisations in the E- reward research had either changed their systems in the past three years or were planning to make changes in the future. The commonest changes are shown in Figure 3.1.

Colville & Millner (2011) recognise that ‘a trap that organisations can fall into is not recognising that the implementation of performance management is a change
