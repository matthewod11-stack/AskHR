## onto some two-dimensional or multidimensional space (Cameron and Quinn 1999).

These studies are not statistically sophisticated and typically treat the whole corpo-

ration as one culture, ignoring subcultures. Other studies focus on a dimension of

culture, like “strength,” and explore its relation to profitability or profit variation (see

Kotter and Heskett 1992; Sgrensen 2002). Still other studies establish the existence

of distinct workplace culture (called “climate” by organizational researchers) and

study its consequences for phenomena like turnover (Bartel et al. 2003; Rebitzer

2002).

The lack of a sharp formal framework and clean empirical identification has cer-

tainly held back organizational economists interested in culture but progress is being

made (see, for example, Hermalin 2001). There is a small emerging literature on

“codes”-—-the language workers use to describe events. Codes have efficiency prop-

erties, depend on shared understanding, and can be difficult to change and imitate,

like other facets of culture (e.g., corporate values). Crémer et al. (2003) assume

that codes are coarse partitions of a large space of events. Coarse partitions are

adequate because workers need not communicate exactly which event has occurred.

Wernerfelt (2004) offers a similar model.

Codes have been studied experimentally by using a picture-naming paradigm. In

these experiments, agents see pictures on a screen. A “manager” must figure out a

code to identify predetermined target pictures to workers. Payoffs depend on how

rapidly the target pictures can be named without errors. Codes develop rapidly:

subjects typically use about 120 characters to describe four picture at first (that is

the length of this sentence so far), but use only about five characters per picture after
