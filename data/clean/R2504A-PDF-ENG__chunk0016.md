# Maintain and Refine

We are just as systematic about maintaining and reﬁning our existing

products and services. To that end, we now have around 50 product

teams across the company, each backed by dedicated product owners, engineers, UX experts, data analysts, risk oﬃcers, customer service

reps, and more, who are directly responsible for each of our oﬀerings.

They’re expected to deliver at least one high-quality add-on innovation

per quarter, and their collective performance is measured by the Net

Promoter Score (NPS) users give their product or service.
