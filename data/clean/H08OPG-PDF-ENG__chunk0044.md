## HBR / Digital Article / What Is the Office for Today?

organizations increasingly happens through being able to integrate diﬀerent perspectives while evaluating diﬀerent angles of a problem (represented by diﬀerent voices and diﬀerent data streams). Physical

space has historically had a vital enabling role in these moments,

at least in tech. Whether known as informal “campﬁre huddles” in

young competition teams, “war rooms” for startups, or “situation

rooms” in more formal technology oﬃces, these types of collaborative

environments set the stage for stakeholders to gather and share

specialized and multidisciplinary data, leading to better group problem-

solving and decision-making.
