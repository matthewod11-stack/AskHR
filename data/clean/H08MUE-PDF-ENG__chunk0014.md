# The Benefits

For many years, organizations assumed that managers or executives

needed to be located near their teams or leadership peers to provide

supervision, coordinate processes, solve immediate problems, and be

accessible for meetings. By deﬁnition, this limited the pool of potential

applicants to people who already lived in these locations or were willing

to move. (And as one of my senior clients recently told me, if his

company had insisted that he move to the corporate headquarters, he

wouldn’t have taken the job.)

The pandemic challenged this assumption. Leaders were still able to be eﬀective without being in physical proximity to their teams or

colleagues on a regular basis. In fact, research from 2023 showed that

workers who were not physically near their supervisors were 15% more

connected to company values and their direct managers than workers

who were.
