A few weeks into my ﬁrst maternity leave, a former colleague and

friend called to check in on me and my infant son, Jay. It had been a

rough birth physically and happened in Manhattan, in the aftermath

of Hurricane Sandy, which added to the stress. I welcomed her call,

thankful to hear her familiar voice.

“How are you doing?” she asked me gently, as we swapped new mom

stories and made plans to meet up soon. “Is everything okay job wise?

Are you still planning to return to work?”
