## Prelearning Interventions and Transfer of Training

Researchers have considered interventions to facilitate learning or to insure that learning is transferred or applied in the work setting. Mesmer-Magnus & Viswesvaran (2010) found that attentional advice and goal orientation that direct learners’ attention, set expectancies, inform training goals and objectives, activate memory, and stimulate recall of prior knowledge were most effectiveforlearninggains.Thevoluminousbodyofresearchontransferoftraininghasfocusedon three areas beyond the design of the formal learning experience to promote transfer: individual differences, organizational climate and culture, and specific transfer enhancement interventions. Blume et al.’s (2010) meta-analysis of this literature supported relationships between transfer and predictorssuchascognitiveability(r¼.37),conscientiousness(r¼.28),motivation(r¼.29),and a supportive work environment (r ¼ .36). Interestingly, most predictor variables had stronger relationships with transfer when the focus of training was on open skills, or those needed to respond to variable stimuli with a number of acceptable responses (e.g., leadership development), compared with closed skills, or those needed to provide correct defined responses to predictable stimuli (e.g., computer software skills).

After-action reviews (AARs) are a design element that can facilitate learning and transfer of training. AARs have traditionally been part of military training and operations but are fre- quently used in training and leadership development programs as well. AARs have been found to increase leadership behavior following a leadership development program, especially for learners who have had challenging work experiences and are high in conscientiousness, openness to experience, and emotional stability (DeRue et al. 2012b). Villado & Arthur (2013) found that student teams who used AARs, compared with those who did not, had enhanced team performance, team efficacy, openness of communication, and cohesion, but not team declarative knowledge. AARs were equally effective regardless of whether the feedback given was subjective or objective.

FACILITATING LEARNING IN THE WORKPLACE Individual differences and situational factors influence employees’ motivation and opportunity to participate in learning. Although we discuss individual differences and situational factors sepa- rately, adopting a person-in-situation perspective can help us better understand learning because such a perspective emphasizes howsituational factors (such as developmental challenges, learning design characteristics, or organizational support) work as moderators by amplifying or con- straining the influence of individual differences on learning outcomes (Tett & Burnett 2003). Many studies focused on learning have supported the person-in-situation perspective (e.g., Gully & Chen 2010, Kraimer et al. 2011).

Below we discuss the roles of the work environment, social exchanges, and individual differ- ences in facilitating learning. Research questions and implications for practice for each facilitating factor are presented in Table 3.
