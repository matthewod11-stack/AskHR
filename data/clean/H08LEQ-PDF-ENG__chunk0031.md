## information as audio signals, visual data, and sensor inputs from

production processes. Audio signals might include the sound a

component makes as it is installed. Sensors may report the weight and

data is enormous: at one plant, the equivalent of more than 40 million

sheets of paper per day. Self-optimizing algorithms synthesize the data,

enabling production personnel to monitor the health of equipment,
