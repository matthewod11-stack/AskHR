# 3.1 Sample

We sent 2,303 questionnaires to human resource managers of Spanish firms. To collect the

information that we needed to complete our research, firms were selected at random from the

database of the Spanish Business Register. We obtained a response rate of 21.6%; thus, the

final sample consisted of 498 firms. The confidence level of the sample is 95% (z=1.96), and

the sampling error is 3.9%.
