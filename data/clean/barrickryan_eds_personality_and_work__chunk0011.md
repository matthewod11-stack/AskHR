# THE ORGANIZATIONAL FRONTIERS SERIES

The Organizational Frontiers Series is sponsored by the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP). Launched in 1983 to make scientiﬁc contributions to the ﬁeld, the series has at- tempted to publish books that are on the cutting edge of theory, research, and theory-driven practice in industrial/organizational psychology and related organizational science disciplines.

Our overall objective is to inform and to stimulate research for SIOP members (students, practitioners, and researchers) and peo- ple in related disciplines, including the other subdisciplines of psy- chology, organizational behavior, human resource management, and labor and industrial relations. The volumes in the Organiza- tional Frontiers Series have the following goals:

- 1. Focus on research and theory in organizational science, and the implications for practice

- 2. Inform readers of signiﬁcant advances in theory and research in psychology and related disciplines that are relevant to our research and practice

- 3. Challenge the research and practice community to develop and adapt new ideas and to conduct research on these developments

- 4. Promote the use of scientiﬁc knowledge in the solution of public policy issues and increased organizational effectiveness

The volumes originated in the hope that they would facilitate continuous learning and a continuing research curiosity about organizational phenomena on the part of both scientists and practitioners.

Previous Frontiers Series volumes, all published by Jossey-Bass, include:
