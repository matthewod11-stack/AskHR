bear the brunt of harassment, as a group they file the most complaints—and, nat- urally, suffer the most when grievance procedures backfire.

But why do those procedures back- fire? The answer, according to a variety of studies, is retaliation against victims who complain. One survey of federal workers found that two-thirds of women who had reported their harassers were subsequently assaulted, taunted, demoted, or fired by their harassers or friends of their harassers.

This kind of retaliation has long-term

effects. Women who file harassment complaints end up, on average, in worse jobs and poorer physical and mental health than do women who keep quiet. And retaliation may be the only thing many victims get after filing a griev- ance, because most procedures protect the accused better than they protect victims.

Part of the problem is that confi- dentiality rules are unenforceable and thus can’t prevent retribution. Both the accused and their accusers are told that the complaint is confidential because the accused is innocent until proven guilty. Those accused often think they are free to tell their friends, and managers who hear complaints may also tell others, looking for either corroboration or support for the accused. No matter how word gets out, friends of the accused may retaliate. After an Ohio waitress complained of harassment, the female manager she told revealed her complaint to coworkers, who subjected the wait- ress to nonstop jokes.

Another part of the problem is evi- dentiary rules. Many companies use the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard

to determine guilt, not the lower “pre- ponderance of evidence” standard that the courts use for harassment claims. That makes it nearly impossible to prove guilt without a confession or a witness. Even if the accused is found guilty, confidentiality generally applies to the ruling, and thus word doesn’t get out that, say, women should steer clear of Jerry.

Yet another is a reluctance to punish

perpetrators. Companies sometimes offer to transfer victims to other depart- ments or locations, but they almost never actually transfer or fire the accused, because they worry that the accused will sue. Instead they typically mandate more training. Many companies even keep verdicts secret from accusers, which can lead to a perverse outcome: A victim who has “won” her case sees her harasser roaming the halls, and believing that this means she has lost it, she becomes dispirited or frustrated or angry and decides to leave her job.

But victims who face retaliation often quit well before the process is complete. That’s what happened in September 2019, after Broti Gupta, a writer for the CBS sitcom Carol’s Second Act, com- plained of intimate touching by an exec- utive producer with the network, which had just revised its complaint system to improve the treatment of accusers. HR went legalistic and approved new rules to keep producers and writers apart. Gupta quit, saying she’d been cut out of the creative process in retaliation. Margee Magee, a writer who took her side, told the New York Times, “All we wanted was for him to watch like a 45-minute harassment video. None of this had to happen.”

The evidence is unambiguous: Our current grievance system puts victims at a distinct disadvantage, through unenforceable confidentiality rules, a high evidentiary bar, and punish- ments that leave harassers in place. Moreover, everybody knows that the system is rigged. That’s why HR officers often counsel victims against filing grievances—and why studies show that only about one in 10 victims makes a formal complaint. The messages you can read in posts at #WhyIDidntReport say it all: They won’t believe me. They’ll put me through a sham hearing. The guy will get off. He’ll try to get back at me. His buddies will think I did something to deserve it. Accusers have only two real options: report harassment and suffer the consequences, or don’t report it.

It’s a lose-lose situation.
