# Conclusion

We have two closing comments. First, it is intrinsic motivation in- widely believed that cludes achievement motivation. It does not (Locke & Schattke, 2018). This confound, un- fortunately, has been accepted in psychology for more than 100 years. In psychology, intrin- sic motivation properly means loving an activ- ity just for its own sake, regardless of how well one performs it (e.g., walking) or just for the sake of contemplation (e.g., music). It means loving what one is doing. The goal setting the- ory is based on achievement motivation (Mc- Clelland, Atkinson, Clark, & Lowell, 1953), which involves striving to meet a standard of excellence; it means not just doing but also doing something well (e.g., attaining a sales objective). Ideally, the two go together, but they can vary independently (e.g., hating being a lawyer while still trying to be excellent at it; loving tennis while being indifferent to attain- ing excellence or even to improving).

Second, we are champions of the inductive method in science. So we conclude this chapter by noting the wisdom of Sherlock Holmes, our favorite detective: “I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to trust facts to suit the- ories, instead of theories to suit facts” (Doyle, 2003).
