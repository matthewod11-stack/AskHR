Design thinking is generally defined as an analytic and creative process that engages a person in opportunities to experiment, create and prototype mod- els, gather feedback, and redesign. Several characteristics (e.g., visualiza- tion, creativity) that a good design thinker should possess have been identified from the literature. The primary purpose of this article is to summarize and synthesize the research on design thinking to (a) better understand its char- acteristics and processes, as well as the differences between novice and expert design thinkers, and (b) apply the findings from the literature regard- ing the application of design thinking to our educational system. The authors’ overarching goal is to identify the features and characteristics of design thinking and discuss its importance in promoting students’ problem-solving skills in the 21st century.
