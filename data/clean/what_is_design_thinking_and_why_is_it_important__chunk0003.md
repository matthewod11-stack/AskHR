Being successful in todayâ€™s highly technological and globally competitive world requires a person to develop and use a different set of skills than were needed before (Shute & Becker, 2010). One of these skills is called design thinking. Design has been widely considered to be the central or distinguishing activity of engineering (Simon, 1996). It has also been said that engineering programs should graduate engineers who can design effective solutions to meet social needs (Evans, McNeill, & Beakley, 1990). Like problem solving, design is a natural and ubiqui- tous human activity. Needs and dissatisfaction with the current state combined with a determination that some action must be taken to solve the problem is the start of a design process. In this view, many scientists have been designing and acting as designers throughout their careers, albeit often not being aware of or recognizing that they are performing in a design process (Braha & Maimon, 1997). According to Braha and Maimon (1997), engineering lacks sufficient scientific foundations. Historically, engineering curricula have been based on models that are devoted to basic science, where students apply scientific principles to techno- logical problems. However, this practice produces engineering graduates who were perceived by industry and academia as being unable to practice in industry. This concern caused leaders of engineering departments and colleges to recognize
