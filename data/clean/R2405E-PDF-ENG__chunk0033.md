## for its equipment, in the late 1990s, the complementary controllers

and underpinning connectivity technology were nowhere near ready.

So the company collaborated with a Belgian start-up, Velleman, to

with an Italian controller producer. Those collaborations led Atlas

Copco to launch AirConnect, which sent users SMS and email alerts

when machines shut down. The service was met with limited interest,
