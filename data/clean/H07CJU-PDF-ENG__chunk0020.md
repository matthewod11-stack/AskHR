## HBR / Digital Article / 5 Things Employers Get Wrong About Caregivers at Work

the time blocked on your calendar as “busy,” share the reason you are unavailable. Rather than saying you’ll be out of the oﬃce for “a

family trip,” be honest that you are taking time oﬀ work to help your

mother move into assisted living. Leaders showcasing that they have

personal lives and care responsibilities can have a huge impact in what

employees feel is “OK” to talk about at work.

Myth #5: If there was a problem with our policies, we’d know about it.

Companies rarely put eﬀort into evaluating policies unless something

prompts them to do so. In a labor market with a low unemployment

level, individual employees might rather leave their job than put in the

extra and often uncompensated work of pointing out policy ﬂaws and

going out on a limb to advocate for changes.

According to research from The Rosalynn Carter Institute, close to one

third of caregiver employees have chosen to leave a job at some point

because of their caregiving responsibilities. If someone says in their

exit interview they are leaving “to spend more time with their kids”

or “have more ﬂexibility to help with their elderly mother,” jumping

to the conclusion that this decision was purely personal can obscure

what the company could have done to better support the employee, and

what policies might have made it possible for them to stay on the job
