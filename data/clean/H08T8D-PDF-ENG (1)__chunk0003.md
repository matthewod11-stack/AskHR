Every leader faces challenges like establishing credibility, managing

up, and building strategic relationships when they start a new role. One

of the most sensitive and critical challenges is giving feedback, which

can feel like walking a tightrope: You haven’t had the chance to build

credibility with your new team, but you’re under pressure to prove your

value quickly. Moving too fast can lead to missteps, while waiting too

long risks inaction and meaningful opportunities lost.
