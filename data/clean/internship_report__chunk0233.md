# XIV. Special Leave

Any staff member may be allowed/granted for special leave at the discretion of the Management.

If someone takes a CL/ML as a prefix with Govt. holiday and subsequently as suffix after a

Govt. holiday then total tenure will be counted as CL/ML. For example if Monday & Tuesday

are Govt. holiday and someone takes leave on Sunday (as prefix) and Wednesday (as suffix) then

his casual leave will be counted from Sunday to Wednesday. But anybody takes a leave only on

Sunday then one day CL/ML will be counted. Also if someone takes only CL/ML on Wednesday

then also one day CL/ML will be counted.
