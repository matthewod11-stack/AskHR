# Training and Workplace Learning

strongly related to the nature of the environment at work, which influences the way adults learn in and through the workplace and underpins the interplay between individual agency, learning, work, and organizational structures in the workplace. This interplay, considered through the lens of social-ecological interdependencies, draws attention to the ways – as Evans, Waite, and Kersh (2011) put it – individuals and groups have spaces in which to exercise agency, while also influencing the whole dynamic at work through the interde- pendencies involved. The environmental scale of workplace learning further encompasses the complexities of the nature of environments at work, which could expand or restrict learning (Fuller & Unwin, 2004). Rapidly changing perceptions and the nature of the workplace – as a space for learning, work, and social engagement – have been facilitated by the current drive towards knowledge-based economies and the notion of learning societies in the contemporary world.
