# Organizational justice as a mediator

We argue that inclusive leadership positively influences OCB through organizational justice. The open and supportive behaviors of inclusive leaders improve organizational procedural justice because employees are likely to perceive that their voices are heard and they are included in decision making (Bayles, 1990). In addi- tion, with inclusive leaders, employees tend to feel that they are treated with respect, which indicates a high degree of organiza- tional interactional justice (Folger & Cropanzano, 1998). Thus, inclusive leadership acts as a catalyst for organizational justice. Organizationaljustice,inturn,maypositivelyinfluenceemployees’ OCB due to employees’ enhanced satisfaction with and trust in the organization(Konovsky &Pugh, 1994).
