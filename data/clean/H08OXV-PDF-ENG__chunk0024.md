## HBR / Digital Article / Research: How “Leisure Crafting” Can Help You Recharge

- 3. Hold Yourself Accountable and Be Willing to Adjust

Setting timeframes or journalling can be a useful way to track your

progress toward your goals, reﬂecting on what’s worked well and what

hasn’t gone as planned. Reviewing old journal entries can also be a

good way to stay inspired when progress feels slow: looking back at how

incremental actions have moved you toward an accomplishment can

help reignite your commitment.

That said, goals are only useful when you’re working toward them. If

a goal is starting to feel like a slog—and you feel yourself dreading

it or blowing it oﬀ—it’s probably a good time to adjust and look for

something that feels energizing and possible.
