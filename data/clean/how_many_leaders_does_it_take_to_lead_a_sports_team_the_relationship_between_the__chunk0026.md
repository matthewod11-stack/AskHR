method has been used extensively in previous studies to assess the number of athlete leaders [11, 15, 17, 19, 20].

Subsequently, for each of the leadership roles, we distinguished three possible leadership structures, namely (a) the leadership role is occupied by no one (zero leaders); (b) the leader- ship role is occupied by a single player (one leader); and (c) the leadership role is occupied by multiple players. Although the last category originally included a broader range of possible leadership structures, ranging from having two leaders to having all the players on the team occupying that leadership role, in reality, there were no teams with more than three leaders in a specific leadership role.

Role clarity. To assess role clarity, we used the 12-item Spanish version [39] of the Role

Ambiguity Scale [21]. An example of role clarity includes “I am clear about the different responsibilities that make up my role.” Players responded to all items on a 9-point scale rang- ing from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree). Thus, higher ratings of agreement indicated greater role clarity and, hence, less role ambiguity.

Role conflict. To assess role conflict, we used a 6-item scale developed by Beauchamp and

Bray [27]. An example item is “I sometimes receive conflicting information of what my role is.” Players rated these items on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Thus, higher ratings of agreement indicated greater role conflict.

Team conflict. To assess team conflict, we used the 6-item scale developed by Tekleab et al. [29] following the guidelines from Jehn [40]. This instrument has six items that comprise two factors: Task Conflict (three items, e.g., “How frequently did people on your team disagree regarding the work being done?”) and Relationship Conflict (three items, e.g., “How frequently were personality conflicts present on your team?”). Players responded to all items on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 9 (always).

Team cohesion. The Short Spanish version of the GEQ [41] developed by Leo et al. [42] was used to assess team cohesion. This 12-item inventory comprises two main factors, namely Task Cohesion (6 items, e.g., “Team members are united in their efforts to reach their perfor- mance goals in training sessions and games”) and Social Cohesion (6 items, e.g., “Team mem- bers would like to spend time together in situations other than training and games”). Responses were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree).

Collective efficacy. To assess collective efficacy, The Football Collective Efficacy Ques- tionnaire [43] was used. This 26-item instrument starts with the stem “Our team has confi- dence in our capability to...” The items refer to specific football situations (e.g., resolving game situations in the attacking phase). Responses were made on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent).
