- Performance management systems serve multiple purposes. First, they serve a strategic purpose because they help link employee activities with the organiza- tion’s mission and goals, they identify results and behaviors needed to carry out strategy, and they maximize the extent to which employees exhibit the desired behaviors and produce the desired results. Second, they serve an administrative purpose in that they pro- duce information used by the reward system and other HR decision making (e.g., promotions, termination, discipli- nary actions). Third, they serve an infor- mational purpose because they enable employees to learn about their perform- ance in relation to the organization’s expectations. Fourth, they serve a devel- opmental purpose in that performance feedback allows individuals to learn about their strengths and weaknesses, to identify training needs, and to make better decisions regarding job assign- ments. Fifth, performance management systems serve an organizational mainte- nance purpose because they provide useful information for workforce plan- ning and for evaluating the effectiveness of other HR systems (e.g., comparing per- formance before and after an expensive training program to determine whether training made a difference). Finally,

performance management systems also serve a documentational purpose; for example, they support HR decisions and help meet legal requirements.

- Ideal performance management sys- tems are rare. Such ideal systems are • congruent with strategy (i.e., there is a clear link among individual, unit, and organizational goals)

- congruent with context (i.e., the sys- tem is consistent with norms based on the culture of the organization and the region and country in which the organization is located)

- thorough (i.e., they include all rele- vant performance dimensions)

- practical (i.e., they do not require excessive time and resources)

- meaningful (i.e., they have impor- tant consequences)

- specific (i.e., they provide a concrete employee improvement agenda) • able to identify effective and inef- fective performance (i.e., they help distinguish employees at different performance levels)

- reliable (i.e., the measurement of performance is consistent)

- valid (i.e., the measures of per- formance are not contaminated or deficient)

- fair (i.e., people participating in the system believe the processes and outcomes are just)

- inclusive (i.e., they include input from multiple sources on an ongo- ing basis)

- open (i.e., they are transparent and there are no secrets)

- correctable (i.e., they include mecha- nisms so that errors can be corrected) • standardized (i.e., performance is evaluated consistently across people and time)

- ethical (i.e., they comply with ethical standards)
