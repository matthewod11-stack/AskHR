# Design Thinking and Its Importance

thinking: (a) preparation, (b) assimilation, and (c) strategic control. In the prepara- tion process, designers need to learn what to focus on and what is relevant. During this phase, the specifications and constraints of the problem, reinterpretation of ideas, visualization, problem reformulation (including situation assessment and elaboration), and others evolve. The assimilation process involves making sense of the proposed solution, data, and observations coming from the design environ- ment, such as feedback from experiments with prototypes. In the strategic control process, designers must make many decisions over the course of a design (e.g., which idea to elaborate or adapt next, which constraints to relax, how to set pri- orities). They also move among various tasks, subproblems, and design processes in a flexible and highly opportunistic manner.

In 2002, Stempfle and Badke-Schaube examined a theory of what design teams actually do while designing. They looked at theories of creativity and problem solving and cognitive theories of human decision making. The basic elements of design thinking that the authors proposed as cognitive operations to deal with any kind of problem were generation, exploration, comparison, and selection. The first two elements (generation and exploration) widen a problem space whereas the last two (comparison and selection) narrow a problem space. When widening a prob- lem, solutions are generated and then examined in relation to the goal. Then, in an iterative process, solutions may be modified or new solutions may be developed until an optimal solution is found. Narrowing a problem entails comparing two or more ideas and then selecting the solutions based on specific and relevant goal criteria. These elements represent a model that can be applied to understand designers’ thinking while working in a team. Designers working in groups have to communicate what they are thinking, thus showing their basic thinking processes. The researchers applied this model to three mechanical engineering teams con- sisting of four to six students. The teams were assigned to design a mechanical concept for an optical device to project images of celestial objects. The teams interacted with a simulated customer at three fixed points in time during their one- day working period. Team communication was recorded. Results from protocol analysis revealed that the teams spent only 10% of their time on clarifying the goal and spent the remaining 90% of the time planning a solution.

The Stempfle and Badke-Schaube (2002) findings described differ from those observed by McNeill, Gero, and Warren (1998) in electronics engineers. McNeill and colleagues reported that across the whole design episode, the designers spent most of their time analyzing the problem; synthesizing the solution took the second greatest amount of time, and the remaining time was spent on the evaluation of the solution. The authors concluded that a designer begins a conceptual design session by analyzing the functional aspects of the problem. As the session progresses, the designer focuses on the three aspects—function, behavior, and structure—and then engages in a cycle of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Toward the end of the design session, the designer’s activity is focused on synthesizing structure and evaluating the structure’s behavior. Similarly, in a team of three industrial design- ers, Goldschmidt and Weil (1998) found that the process of design thinking is nonlinear and that designers follow a forward (breaking down) and backward (validating) reasoning strategy. Although research is not consistent about how time is spent during the design thinking process, findings indicate that there is a learning
