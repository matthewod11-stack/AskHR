# TRAINING ALTERNATIVES

If the typical harassment training leads to the loss of female managers and makes the bad guys a little worse, it’s probably time to start thinking about more-effective types of training. We’ve identified two in our research.

Bystander-intervention training. This is the most promising alternative we’ve come across. Sharyn Potter and her team at the University of New Hamp- shire’s Prevention Innovation Research Center have long conducted interesting experiments with it on college campuses and military bases, where harassment and assault are rampant. A dozen years ago they piloted a college bystander- intervention program that has since been used on more than 300 campuses. In 2011 it was adapted for the U.S. Army. In their programs, Potter and her team start with the assumption that trainees are allies working to solve the problems of harassment and assault rather than potential perps. Everybody’s job is to nip misbehavior in the bud. It’s the “If you see something, say (or do) something” approach. Properly trained

bystanders interrupt the sexual joke. They call out the catcallers. They distract the drunk pair who have just met but are set to leave the party together. The approach is surprisingly effective. Stu- dents and soldiers who have taken part in bystander training consistently report that it has helped them know what to do when they see signs of a problem. Most important, even months after the train- ing, trainees are significantly more likely than others to report having intervened in real-life situations.

Word is getting out about the merits of bystander training. Potter now chairs a nonprofit that develops programs for organizations of all sorts. The U.S. Air Force has developed its own. When the city of New York mandated in 2018 that all employers provide harassment training, it also required them to cover bystander intervention and offered a model online program that is free to employers. Unfortunately, the whole program lasts only 45 minutes and covers five topics, including forbidden behaviors. That’s a far cry from what studies have found to be effective for college students and military personnel: several hours of live training that focuses on bystander intervention.

Manager training. Training delivered

exclusively to managers is also quite effective. In our study, companies that adopted distinct manager-training programs saw significant gains in the percentage of women in their manage- rial ranks, with white women rising by more than 6%, African American and Asian American women by 5%, and Latinas by 2%.

Manager training works because it presents harassment as a challenge that
