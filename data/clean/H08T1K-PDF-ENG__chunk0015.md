# Highlight progress

The steady drumbeat of bad news might be inescapable, but it’s not exactly motivating. That’s why you need to “aﬃrm what’s going well,

what can be repeated, and what strong performance looks like,” says

Lynch. Point out where your team is growing by benchmarking against

internal data on quality or speed. “The key is to do so in the context

of big picture challenges, so you don’t come across as tone deaf.” For

example: “We’re ﬁlling orders faster than ever before, even though

overall volume is down. That reﬂects growth in how we work and

deliver.” Eikenberg recommends inviting up-and-coming leaders to

share case studies and success stories that show how the team’s eﬀorts

tie to bigger goals. “As a leader, you need to make the invisible visible,”

she says.
