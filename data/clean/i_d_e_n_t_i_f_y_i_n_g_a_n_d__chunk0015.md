# Skill bottlenecks

Work often slows when employees reach the limits of their expertise and need input from other departments or experts. This can create bottlenecks and delay progress.Âª

AI can help bridge these gaps, helping employees expand their skillsets (from data analysis and trend visualization to coding) without waiting for additional support. Expert teams get more time back from lower value cross functional tasks, and everyone else learns to communicate in their language.

Our product manager use AI to create interactive prototypes without needing to slow down to wait for other teams to help.
