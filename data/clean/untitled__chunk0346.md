## THE 1920s: THE DECADE OF POPULAR PSYCHOLOGY

American historians have written of the public euphoria in the United States that followed World War I. American forces had helped to win the war in Europe. There was general economic prosperity, and a growing belief in the American dream that anything was possible, with hard work. Writing for the American public in 1925, psychologist John B. Watson (1878–1958) promoted this nurturistic optimism:

Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own speciﬁed world to bring them up in and I’ll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select—doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. (Watson, 1925, p. 82)

Americans seemed delirious with the potential for psychol- ogy to improve their lives. The ﬁrst popular psychology magazines (four of them) began publication in the decade. Countless self-help books were published, and newspapers carried daily columns of psychological advice. Touting the value of psychology for the public, journalist Albert Wiggam (1928) wrote:

Men and women never needed psychology so much as they need it to-day. . . . You cannot achieve these things [effectiveness and happiness] in the fullest measure without the new knowledge of your own mind and personality that the psychologists have given us. (p. 13)

Public demand for psychological services grew rapidly, and consequently, many individuals, with little or no training in psychology, offered their services to the public as psychologists.

Consulting psychologists were especially concerned about such pseudopractitioners and petitioned the APA to create a certiﬁcation program to identify psychologists qualiﬁed to consult with the public. Initially, the APA balked at the idea butrelentedin1924,whenitestablishedsuchaprogram.Four years later, after fewer than 30 psychologists had received certiﬁcation, the program was abandoned (Sokal, 1982b). There was no mechanism for enforcement of such a program, and the public seemed incapable of making distinctions

between qualiﬁed psychologists and unqualiﬁed ones, or at least was uninterested in doing so. Nevertheless, psychology of all kinds prospered—and the professional opportunities in business, school, clinical, and counseling psychology grew at a rapid rate.
