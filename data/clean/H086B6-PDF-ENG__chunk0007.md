## HBR / Digital Article / When Your Colleagues Have an Outdated Perception of You

Identify the perception gap. We all have words we’d use to describe ourselves. But how do others see us? Getting clear about the diﬀerences

will help you understand the gap and design actions to close it.

Take Sarah’s client Mike*, who was a long-tenured senior leader in

a consumer-packaged goods company. He’d acquired a reputation for

being emotional and aggressive due to a few badly timed outbursts in

meetings. Soon, that perception was rooted in organizational lore and

began to supersede present-day realities.

Mike, however, was shocked when he learned others saw him as

aggressive. Realizing the perception gap, he worked with Sarah to learn

strategies to calm himself when he was getting agitated, channel his

frustration into productive conversations, and get clear once again on

the leader he wanted to be. He took ownership of the space between

whom others saw and who he wanted to be.

Align your actions. As long-term employees ascend the ranks, it’s

not uncommon to have diﬃculty delegating and letting go of

responsibilities that once made them successful. Holding on to long-

held work assignments may help you feel productive, but it also means

your colleagues are more likely to associate you with your previous role
