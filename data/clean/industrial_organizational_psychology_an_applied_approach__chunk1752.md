# Halo Errors

A halo error occurs when a rater allows either a single attribute or an overall impression of an individual to affect the ratings that she makes on each relevant job dimension. For example, a teacher might think that a student is highly cre- ative. Because of that, the teacher might rate the student as being intelligent and industrious when, in fact, the student’s grades are below average. In this case, the instructor has allowed the student’s creativity to cloud her judgment of the student’s other abilities. Halo effects occur especially when the rater has little knowledge of the job and is less familiar with the person being rated (Kozlowski, Kirsch, & Chao, ). Halo error is also more common in peer ratings than in supervisor ratings of subordinates (Viswesvaran, Schmidt, & Ones, ).

Usually, halo error is statistically determined by correlating the ratings for each dimension with those for the other dimensions. If they are highly corre- lated, halo error is often said to have occurred. As one might expect, there are explanations other than halo error for the high correlation among rating dimen- sions. Some psychologists have argued that consistent ratings across several dimensions might indicate actual consistencies in employee performance across
