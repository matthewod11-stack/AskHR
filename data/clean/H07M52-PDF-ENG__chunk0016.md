# Channeling Energy

In some teams, the problem isn’t that individual team members lack

energy, but rather that their eﬀorts are scattered across too many

diﬀerent projects at once. A leader of this kind of team needs to channel

energy by focusing everyone’s disparate attention and eﬀorts in the

same direction to become more collectively powerful.

Since the start of Covid-era hybrid working, time spent in virtual

meetings has skyrocketed (one Microsoft study showed an increase

of 252% since February 2020). Employees are increasingly pulled into

back-to-back meetings, leaving them no time to even handle critical

follow-up tasks, let alone recharge. In these situations, the problem is

not only that people’s energy is sapped by the constant switching costs

but also that their remaining energy is split across too many priorities.

And at companies with recent layoﬀs, remaining employees may be

tapped for even more tasks and projects.

Another insidious aspect for these teams is that managers may

misinterpret team members’ divided energy and attention. For example,

a manager of a hybrid team might jump to a conclusion that a person

working from home is actually lazy, checked out, or otherwise unhelpful

when the actual root cause of their low energy is overcommitment. This

is a case of the fundamental attribution error, a common cognitive bias

where people downplay situational factors and exaggerate personality-

related ones. This faulty assumption leads to a ﬁxation on monitoring

inputs or micromanaging, which were cited in our research as some of

the most common ways leaders deplete energy.
