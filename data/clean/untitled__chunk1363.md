# 224 Social Psychology

This transition involves the scientiﬁc inscription of multiple social selves, cybernetic loops between self and other, and a reworking of psychology’s subject. Perhaps it was in recog- nizing these civilian engagements of social psychology—its contributions to deﬁning psychological personhood—that Gordon Allport revised his initial history of social psychol- ogy with the opening claim that “Social psychology is an ancient discipline. It is also modern—ultramodern and exciting” (1985, p. 1).

In recognizing the material and political inﬂuences on the intellectual conceptions of the social and individual, such his- torical understanding comprehends how “the history of social psychology is inseparable from much of the political history of the twentieth century and from argument about power, jus- tice, freedom and obligation” (Smith, 1997, p. 747). Social psychology’s evolution must be understood, therefore, as plural, multisited, and morally and politically inspired. Such a historical perspective situates social psychology as one, albeit crucial, project to understand human nature through scientiﬁc method, and ultimately, to apply that scientiﬁc knowledge to the enhancement of human welfare.

Contrasted with this situated historical perspective is a narrative accounting of social psychology that charts the ﬁeld’s rise and contributions on progressive terms (Allport, 1954; Jones, 1985). In this progressive history crucial labo- ratory experiments are named to serve as pivotal points in social psychology’s development as scientiﬁc. Disregarded in these scientiﬁcally internalist accounts are political and moral as well as disciplinary conditions that compelled par- ticular models of the individual and the social. Similarly eschewed are empirical projects initiated but abandoned, alternative models and research practices, and challenges to the scientiﬁc status quo. In preparing this chapter, we were at once pulled in one direction by the need to trace fruition of these progressive intellectual commitments within experi- mental work, and tugged in another by the desire to generate an earnest account of the sociopolitical dynamics and the vibrant intellectual enterprises that yielded multiple, some- times controversial conceptions of social psychology. With- out giving the chapter over to one or the other historical narrative, we seek to chart those culminating forces in social psychology’s subject matter, its continuing struggles over research methods, and its stronghold in the public imagina- tion of twentieth-century American life. Factors inﬂuencing social psychology’s emergence, development, and paradig- matic commitments, considered in conjunction with the so- cial identity and demeanor of the social psychologist, frame our review, as does social psychology’s broader concern with the nature of what is taken as the individual and the social.

The ﬁrst section begins this charting of emergences in a variety of proposals published in the ﬁnal decade of the nine- teenth century and the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth. Factors that shaped the contours of social psychology, choices that delimited ideal methods, the nature of what is taken as social, and the demeanor of the social psychologist are reviewed in the second section. In the third part, several classic projects undertaken prior to and during World War II are described: These cases illuminate the interdependence of science, cul- ture, and politics, charting the postwar emergence of a society yearning to be understood in psychological terms (Herman, 1995) and of a ﬁeld increasingly self-aware of its reﬂexive entanglements with the very subjects it sought to study. The ﬁnal two sections describe social movements and intellectual endeavors from the 1960s to the end of the cen- tury, highlighting cybernetic inﬂuences and wider Western intellectual debates on the nature of knowledge as well as more speciﬁc theories that ultimately served to transform time and again social psychology’s subject.
