## mindsets from the busy, conscious state of beta to the more relaxed

and creative state of alpha or theta. Additionally, if you’re running

a brainstorm or ideation session, begin with an energizer activity as

people enter the room or immediately after breaks to counteract the

return to a beta state caused by checking emails or other routine tasks.

This approach ensures that playfulness is used eﬀectively to move

between mental states. While life would be fun if we were playful

every minute of every day, productivity requires a balance. By being

intentional about when and how to integrate play, you can cultivate

an environment where employees regularly reach their most creative

states, driving innovation and success in the workplace.
