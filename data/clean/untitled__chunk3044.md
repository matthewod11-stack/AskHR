each other and were able to gather 13 other psychologists also interested in psychology and law. In 1969, the American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) was incorporated with 101 charter members. From this small group, the AP-LS grew to a membership of 2000 by the century’s end. In 1984, the AP-LS merged with the three-year-old APA Division 41, Psychology and Law (Fulero, 1999; Grisso, 1991).

Tensions between science and application were present from the beginning of the society. Asigniﬁcant portion of the membership wanted to focus on developing the forensic ap- plication of psychology and saw the society as a means of re- ﬁning the role of psychologists in the legal system. An equally signiﬁcant percentage of the membership sought a sounder basis for psychological contributions to law through research. An early crisis between the groups was sparked by the publication of Ziskin’s Coping with Psychiatric and Psy- chological Testimony (1970). Ziskin challenged the reliabil- ity and admissibility of most psychological and psychiatric testimony and declared that serious research was needed to bring psychological testimony up to acceptable standards. The debate and conﬂict that ensued from the book’s publica- tion led to Ziskin’s resignation from AP-LS in 1973. Para- doxically, the effect of the book was to steer the society toward greater support of research in the social and experi- mental foundations of psychology and law.

By the late 1970s, a younger cohort of psychologists in- terested in law moved into AP-LS leadership. Many of these young psychologists were interested in the applicability of their ﬁeld to social issues, especially the improvement of legal institutions (Grisso, 1991). The vigorous leadership of Bruce Sales (1976–1977) energized the society. Sales had a vision of the AP-LS as the major public organization at work at the interface of psychology and law. Under his leadership, new publishing ventures were begun, including the founding of the society journal, Law and Human Behavior.

The emphasis on research and social action left many of the forensic expert witnesses without a clear sense of their place in AP-LS. In the last half of the 1970s, AP-LS clinical forensic members went outside the society to start an inde- pendent board that was charged with establishing credentials for diplomate status in forensic psychology (Kaslow, 1989). The AP-LS assisted with the establishment of the American Board of Forensic Psychology but was not responsible for it. Thus, by 1980, the AP-LS represented the major areas of psy- chology and law.

By 1977, some psychologists were active in calling for an APA division of psychology and law. In 1977–1978, the AP-LS became actively involved and worked to gather the necessary signatures to petition the APA Council of Rep- resentatives for a new division. The council approved the

division in 1980, and Division 41, Psychology and Law, was established in 1981. The leaders of AP-LS initially resisted a merger between the society and the division, but by 1983 it was clear that a merger was the most effective way for the two groups to work together. In 1984, the two groups merged and provision was made for AP-LS members who were not psychologists. Most of the nonpsychologists were lawyers, and they represented a sizable percentage of the AP-LS membership.

The combined AP-LS/Division 41 worked on many sig- niﬁcant issues after their merger. Among the more salient were ethics guidelines for forensic psychologists, syllabi for courses in psychology and law, and the pursuit of specialty status from APA for forensic psychology.

As in all areas of American psychology where both clinicians and scientists are active, opportunities for conﬂict havebeenpresent.Attheendofthetwentiethcentury,AL-PS/ Division 41 had successfully managed the mineﬁeld at the borderland between science and practice.
