Workers play a crucial role in OHS. They should be actively involved in identifying hazards, providing feedback, and participating in safety programs. Training and education are essential to ensure that employees are aware of potential risks and know how to protect themselves and their colleagues.

Its importance cannot be overstated, as it not only protects the health and well-being of employees but also contributes to legal compliance, cost reduction, and enhanced productivity. By adhering to the principles of hazard identification, prevention, worker involvement, and continuous improvement, organizations can create safer and healthier work environments for their employees, ultimately benefiting both individuals and the business as a whole.
