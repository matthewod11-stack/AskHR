## HBR / Digital Article / Help Your Employees Develop the Skills They Really Need

Yet we need to do better. We know that, after decades of trying,

skills related to lean manufacturing, agile development and overcoming

unconscious bias, just to name a few, are woefully under-adopted in

most organizations. In fact, a recent report by McKinsey found that 87%

of ﬁrms surveyed expect to have a skills gap in the next ﬁve years.

More training is not the answer. We can’t simply send employees

to workshops focused on whatever proﬁciency is fashionable at the

moment and expect to get results. What is essential is to build coherent

skills-based strategies. We must think seriously about which speciﬁc

skills are to be targeted, who has to learn them, and what mix of

education, experience, and exposure will be eﬀective to create the skills-

based organizations we need to meet the challenges of the future.

For example, at the software company PKWARE, where Todd was

executive vice president, the company invested more than 1% of

expected impact because the employees weren’t consistently getting the

mentoring and real-time coaching they needed to sustain the initial
