# What Do Minorities Want?

Most of the research on ally behavior and cognitions has been conducted from the alliesâ€™ perspective; previous studies examine interviews and surveys that ask allies what it is that they feel is important for themselves to do to support minority com- munities. Brooks and Edwards (2009) included this perspective in their study, but interestingly also interviewed 10 minorities (LGBT people in their particular study) to ask what it is they want from allies. Many of the themes they uncovered were similar to what allies self-identified, such as inclusion and equity. However, LGBT individuals identified another need they want from allies that was more personal: safety. In particular, the LGBT people in this study wanted help from their allies to ensure they felt not just physically safe in the workplace but also emotionally safe. This was not an idea non-minorities thought about (possibly because they do not have to worry about this in the same way minorities do), highlighting the impor- tance of talking to both allies and minorities when exploring this topic.
