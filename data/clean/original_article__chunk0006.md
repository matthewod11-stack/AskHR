# Improving corporate performance

The prevalent framework used to interpret and predict the motivations and behaviors of individual directors has been based in economic theories. Scholars have employed agency theory (Eisenhardt, 1989; Boyd, 1990; Donaldson and Davis, 1991; Bathala and Rao, 1995), stewardship theory (Donaldson and Davis, 1991, Muth and Donaldson, 1998) and resource dependence theory (Casciaro and Piskorski, 2005; Haynes and Hillman, 2010) as the lens through which to observe, interpret and predict director behaviors, in their activities to optimize the ﬁnancial return to shareholders. Despite these theories having been criticized as too narrow when considered as a sole theoretical framework (Eisenhardt, 1989), there is value in understand- ing that directors do provide important monitor- ing functions in an attempt to resolve, or at least mitigate, agency conﬂicts between agents and principals (Bathala and Rao, 1995).

Another stream of research – the newest in the portfolio of approaches – is the use of behavioral to explain board actions and outcomes (Hambrick et al, 2008; Van Ees et al, 2009; Huse et al, 2011). These theories include some new and some old behavioral theories including identity theory (Ashforth and Mael, 1989), theory of planned behavior and reasoned action (Madden et al, 1992; Ajzen, 2002), and social networking theory (Granovetter, 1973), as well as various theories of the ﬁrm that have recently been applied to board behavior (Cyert and March, 1963; Grant, 1996; Rumelt, 1997; Slater, 1997) in framing and interpreting director actions and their impact on ﬁrm outcomes. Despite diverse approaches and underlying theories employed by scholars, there is consensus that observing boards, understanding their behavior and pre- dicting the impact on corporate outcomes is virtually impossible because of the difﬁculty in gaining access to actual board processes (Pettigrew, 1992; Daily et al, 2003). In addition to reviewing the panoply of theoretical frame- works, we observe that the prevalent unit of analysis is the individual director, and that most economic and legal theory relies on the actions
