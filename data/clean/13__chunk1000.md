## The Happy/Productive Worker Thesis Revisited

This [over]emphasis on negative events, coupled with the apparent minimization of social contact, eventually takes its toll. Relative to their happier coworkers, unhappy people are likely to have lower self-esteem (Diener et al., 1999; Myers, 1993; Wright, 2005). Similarly, unhappy individuals perceive that they have less control over events in their lives and are less optimistic about the future (Cropanzano & Wright, 2001; Dember & Brooks, 1989; Seligman, 1998). This sense of demoralization may make unhappy people less proactive (Argyle, 1987), more prone to stress symptoms (Myers & Diener, 1995), more likely to blame themselves for failures, and to generalize from failure experiences (e.g., Peterson & Seligman, 1984; Staw, 2004; Staw & Cohen-Charash, 2005). Considered together, these characteristics of unhappy people are likely to not only adversely affect oneâ€™s own performance, but may well negatively impact the performance of their coworkers. As with job performance, employee retention has long been a subject of much interest to organizational scholars.
