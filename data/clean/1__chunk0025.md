# Gaps in the Literature

Despite growing research, critical gaps remain:

- Disability Representation: Most studies focus on gender and racial biases, wi on AI-related disability discrimination (Moss, 2021).

- Disability Representation: Most studies focus on gender and racial biases, wi on AI-related disability discrimination (Moss, 2021).

Intersectionality: There is little exploration of how overlapping identities (e.g., disabled individuals from marginalized racial groups) compound discrimination in AI hiring (Moss, 2021).

- Policy Effectiveness: Although there is advocacy for bias audits, few studies have assessed whether these audits actually reduce disability-based discrimination (Hunkenschroer & Luetge, 2022).
