# performers, out of the organisation (Michaels, Hadfield-Jones and Axelrod, 2001). We

do not advocate the former approach as it is inconsistent with our call for a differentiation

between key roles and key talent in organisations. It is neither practical nor desirable to

fill all positions in an organisation with A performers. This would result in an over-

investment in non-pivotal roles in the organisation. Similarly, we posit that the focus of

talent management systems should be on high-potential and high-performing employees

operating in key roles and not all employees in the organisation. Such an approach will

facilitate a more deliberate utilization of organisation resources

The final element of our definition recognises the importance of differentiated

human resource architecture to facilitate the filling of key positions within the

organisation with competent incumbents and ensuring their continued commitment to the

organisation. We draw insights from the strategic human resources literature in this

regard (Becker and Huselid, 2006; Huselid et al, 2005; Lepak and Snell 1999; 2002).

This element of our definition overlaps with the other two elements by facilitating the

identification of high potential and high performing employees, and the helping in the

development of the organisation’s talent pool. Once identified, the challenge for the

organisation is to deploy appropriate human resource policies to ensure these individuals

are strategically deployed and supported with appropriate HR policies.

Clarifying the conceptual boundaries of strategic talent management represents

an important task in the development of the topic. It provides a frame of reference for

academics and practitioners in developing research in the field. It is also important in

helping to differentiate strategic talent management from strategic human resource

management. In this regard we argue that in contrast to strategic human resource

management, which while recently recognising the differing contribution of different

groups of employees within the firm, generally focuses on all employees within an

organisation; strategic talent management focuses on those incumbents who are included

in the organisation’s pivotal talent pool and who occupy, or are being developed to

occupy, pivotal talent positions. Finally a clear definition presents a useful point of

departure in developing theory in the field. We now proceed to present a theoretical

model of strategic talent management which draws insights from a number of distinct but

interrelated research streams.
