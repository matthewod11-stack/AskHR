## Fiala (2015), Bodnaruk and Simonov (2016)).

Similarly applies to the stability of the measurements (i.e. their reliability). Although the tastes elicited through behavioral methods are not conceptually different from other more “standard” types of tastes (i.e. for a particular food, sport, car, etc.), it is important to enhance our understand- ing about the temporal stability of these measurements. The stability of intertemporal and risk preference measures has received considerable interest, with evidence suggesting that they display medium-to-high reliability and test-retest corre- lations in the range typically observed for personality traits (e.g. Kirby (2009), Harrison and Mckay (2012), W¨olbert and Riedl (2013), Beauchamp et al. (2015)). Nevertheless, while a number of studies analyzing the stability of other measures such as social preferences have yielded similar (positive) ﬁnd- ings (e.g. Murphy et al. (2011), Falk et al. (2016)), further research is clearly needed here.
