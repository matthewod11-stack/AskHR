## HBR / Digital Article / A Data-Based Approach to Delegating

When I ask executives, “What, according to you, should you delegate?”

I can see them scanning their memories for tasks they would be

comfortable handing over to someone else. Rarely have I seen them

come up with anything signiﬁcant. As a result, they talk about giving up

a few low-risk activities but miss the opportunity to hand over anything

substantive and meaningful. The truth is: Many senior leaders carry

out tasks that might appear seemingly small but are surprisingly time

consuming, and the value they generate isn’t proportional to the time

spent on them. In essence, these tasks rob senior leaders of valuable

time that can be spent on more strategic, higher ROI activities.

To help my clients give visibility into (and measure) these tasks, I ask

them to use a classic time management tool for identifying ineﬃciency

and redundancy: a time log. Instead of relying on a leader’s memory, a

time log presents data of where their time is actually being spent.

Consider the example of a CFO (let’s call him Mike) I was recently

coaching. Mike had been promoted from a corporate controller position

internally. He knew at a conceptual level that he should be reallocating

how he spent his time but was struggling to identify what he could

delegate to his team. Once he had two weeks of time log data, he quickly

recognized all of the tasks he carried forward from his old job into his

new one. There were some reports that he was still running for the CEO,

as well as some reconciliation tasks that he had not gotten around to

teaching his new controller how to perform. He also spotted several

meetings he was attending that would be better attended by a member

of his team. In all, Mike found about 20 hours a month of activities

(tasks and meetings) that he could delegate. He learned so much from

keeping his own time log that he asked each of his direct reports to do
