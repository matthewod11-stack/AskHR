all managers must deal with. In that way it resembles bystander training. Participants, men and women alike, are encouraged to imagine what they might see other people doing wrong; the focus is deliberately not on what they them- selves might do wrong. Trainers advise participants on how to recognize early signs of harassment and how to inter- vene swiftly and effectively to prevent escalation.

Our research shows that men pay attention during manager training. Why? In part because they feel they’re being given new tools that will help them solve problems they haven’t known how to handle in the past—and in part because they’re assumed to be potential heroes rather than villains. Everybody’s in it together, learning how to recognize and curb dubious behaviors in ways that will improve the overall work environment.
