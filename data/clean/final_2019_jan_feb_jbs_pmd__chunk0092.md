set of principles, tasks, and procedures focused at enhancing the interested and competent employees for the mutuality of individuals, host organization s, and community at large.

According to Garavanet al., (2012) talent development emphasizes on the planning, selecting and execution of development techniques for the talented individuals to make sure that the organization has the present as well as forecasted inventory of talent to achieve business goals and the development tasks are in sync with th e talent management programs of the organization.

Thunnissenet al., (2013) stressed that talent development coupled with talent attraction and engagement are considered as the three principal techniques or processes in TM. Pruis (2011) stressed that talent development is a long term, holistic an d comprehensive process that keeps the organization stable, progressive and creative. Therefore, Neal a nd Sonsino (2012) concluded that the existence of the organization counts on their creativity in practice s, procedures, products and leadership. Ketter (2010) recommends that as organizations strive in new marketplace with limited resources, talent development remains a requisite for them.

Stahl et al., (2012) asserted that “one of the major issues being faced by the corporates worldwide is t o create and maintain a strong pool of talent” and one definite way of creating talent pipeline is in the form of talent development. Govaerts et al., (2010) in his study revealed that organizations need to implement talent development systems if they intend to retain their employees. He also stressed that organization s should allow staff members to learn new things and practice what they are well-versed in.Gandz (2006) revealed that talent development practices are usually carried out by establishments to make sure that there is no talent deficit, to assure envisioned progress ion instead of substitution, and to brand the organization like a talent magnet in the corporate world.

Inclusive versus Exclusive approach toward Talent Development The inference of inconsistencies in interpretation of talent implies that it ca n mean whatsoever firms and

establishments would like it to imply (Gallardo- Gallardo et al., 2013) and consequently, this perception of talent decides which set of worker sought to be developed. Few establishments, for example, will involve all grades of employee in their definition of talent, whereas others will concentrate on handpicked ones only.

Iles et al., (2010) have pointed out disagreement regarding what talent may comprise of for the purpose of developing the talent of any individual. Consequently, two approaches to talent development were identified: an exclusive approach which centralizes on crucial tasks, profiles and trains them to perform these responsibilities and an inclusive approach th at centralizes on developing all budding staffs; this eventually leads to maximumadvantages for the establishments (Pruis 2011).

Talent can be seen as being exclusive to some great- performance workers or as a characteristic that every workers exhibits in a certain degree and that can be cultured and evolved by way of different mechanisms (Lewis and Heckman, 2006; Collings and Mellahi, 2009). Downs &Swailes (2013) asserts that approaches pertaining to talent are usually an exclusive process concentrating on a small fraction of workers in an establishment termed as key players or stars; regardless of the truth that “talent persists at every level o f employees, development processes in establishment concentrate mostly on top executive and administrative positions”

Berger and Berger (2003) advocates inclusive approach and believe that every individual has one talent or the other that can be determined and unleashed. Nevertheless, they recommend that an establishment that facilitates talent management effectively classifies workers and emphasize development investments in key, great-performance and highly-promising employees.Baum (2008) stressed that management should apprehend talent from inclusive perspective, to ensure that all employees are considered based on their ability to assume additional duties and assignments and be elevated within their department and in the broader sense organization.
