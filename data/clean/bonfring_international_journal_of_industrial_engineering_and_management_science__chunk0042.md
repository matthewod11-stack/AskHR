It takes time to adapt to balanced scorecard strategic system. So this will require a lot of motivation from the management to be able to successfully complete the process.

Balanced scorecard gives you an extensive overview of the company. It will give you facts about your company's execution and performance. But it will not give you recommendations on how to amend strategies and policies to overcome discrepancies. Therefore, for attainment of a complete analysis of a company's performance, a more magnanimous strategy will be required.

While the balanced scorecard gives you an overall view of the in business growth and development, these four areas do not paint the whole picture. The financial information included on the scorecard is limited. Instead, the balanced scorecard must be part of a bigger strategy for company growth that includes meticulous accounting methods.
