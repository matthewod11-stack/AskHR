# Time Off Is Essential

First, let’s be clear that taking periodic breaks in order to reset and

recover from work stress (what researchers refer to as work recovery)

isn’t a “nice to have” — it’s essential for sustained performance and

growth. Just as athletes engage in regular periods of rest and recovery

in order to perform at their best and avoid injury, workers need periods

of time away from their jobs to recuperate from the strain of work and

replenish their physical and mental energy.

Research shows that those who don’t take the opportunity to rest,

recharge, and recover are at higher risk of exhaustion, low motivation,

poor performance, and burnout, while those who engage in regular

periods of work recovery enjoy better sleep, higher job satisfaction,

more engagement, and higher job performance. Human bodies and

brains simply aren’t built to endure chronic stress, and there’s plenty

of evidence showing how disconnecting from the strains and demands

of work not only lowers stress, but increases productivity and boosts

creativity. Even micro-breaks taken throughout the workday, such as

stretching, doing some deep breathing exercises, or stepping outside for

some fresh air, can halt the stress cycle and return you to baseline.
