The general form of the equation to predict Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd from Employee reprimand, Codes of conduct, Employee disciplinary procedures, E(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ee rules a(cid:374)d regulatio(cid:374)s is: Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3 + β4X4 + ε Where Y = E(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ee performance at Mukurwe-i(cid:374)i Dair(cid:455) Ltd; β(cid:1004) = Co(cid:374)sta(cid:374)t Ter(cid:373); β1, β2, a(cid:374)d β3 = Beta coefficients; X1= Employee Reprimand; X2= Codes of conduct; X3= Employee disciplinary procedures; X4 =

E(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ee rules a(cid:374)d regulatio(cid:374)s a(cid:374)d ε = Error term. The model equation would be; Y=34.555 + 0.506X1 + 0.603X2+ 0.559X3 + 0.622X4. Predicted Employee performance at Mukurwe- ini Dairy Ltd = 34.555 + (0.506 x Employee Reprimand) + (0.603 x Codes of conduct) + (0.559 x Employee disciplinary procedures) + (0.622 x Employee rules and regulations). This is obtained from the Coefficients table, as shown in Table 4.12, from above regression equation; the study found out that when all independent variables (Employee reprimand, Codes of conduct, Employee disciplinary procedures, Employee rules and regulations) are kept constant at zero the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd will be at 34.555. At one percent change in Employee Reprimand will lead to (0.506%) variations in the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. Also a one percent change in codes of conduct will lead to the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. Further, a one percent change in Employee disciplinary procedures will lead to (0.559%) variations in the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd and one percent increase in Employee rules and Regulations will lead to (0.622%) variations in the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. This concludes that
