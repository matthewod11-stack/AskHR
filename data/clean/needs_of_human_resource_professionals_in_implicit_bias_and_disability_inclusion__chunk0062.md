## 4.2. Disability inclusion policies and practices

The second theme points to the usefulness of disability inclusion policies and procedures in addressing bias in the workplace. The role of senior management in the adoption of disability inclusion policies influences the commitment to disability inclusion across the organization. Using training opportunities to educate HR professionals and other hiring managers on the importance of disability inclusion can lead to a larger number of employees with disabilities in these organizations. Recent research supports the development and implementation of disability inclusion policies. Specifically, a study conducted by Accenture, a Fortune Global 500 company specializing in information technology services and consulting, indicates American businesses that hired and supported workers with disabilities observed improved performance and productivity with 28% higher revenue and 30% higher profit margins (Disability:IN, 2019), which clearly supports including people with disabilities in the workplace.

Results from the current study are also consistent with research examining characteristics of companies that hire and accommodate people with disabilities. Gilbride et al. (2003) found companies committed to disability inclusion were characterized by normative beliefs across all levels of the company and a strong commitment at the senior management/executive level to include employees with disabilities in the organization’s workforce. Similar results from Chan and colleagues (2010) found companies that included disability in their diversity, equity, and inclusion policies had a higher representation of people with disabilities in their workforce. Fraser and colleagues (2011) conducted an employer study to evaluate predictors of hiring intention of persons with disabilities. They reported a company’s climate of inclusion is influenced by the normative beliefs of executive/senior management, and their beliefs will either support or hinder the hiring and retaining of people with disabilities (Fraser et al., 2010). Bezyak et al. (2020) also identified seven disability inclusion
