# Brain Hemisphere Theories

Discovery of the brain’s division into two hemispheres led to an interpretation of psychopathology as caused by a breakdown in the activity integration between the two hemispheres. Esquirol (1838) attributed impairment to the duality of the brain, whose two hemispheres, “if not equally activated, do not act simultaneously.” Benjamin Rush (1745– 1813) speculated that the mind, like vision, is a double organ, which could account for cases of somnambulism in which patients seemed to experience two independent states of consciousness. And the French neurologist, Marie François Xavier Bichat, explained that the brain has two hemispheres because the organism must interact with the external world in a uniﬁed way with both sides of the body (Harrington, 1987).

In 1844, during the autopsy of an apparently normal man, Arthur Ladbroke Wigan reported that the man possessed only one cerebral hemisphere, evidence that a person requires only one to function normally. Wigan concluded that “. . . each cerebrum is a distinct and perfect whole,” capable of inde- pendent thought and volition, and suggested that the healthy brain synchronizes the actions of the two hemispheres, with one of the two dominant and controlling the volitions of the other. He speculated that in mental disease “one cerebrum becomes sufﬁciently aggravated to defy the control of the other,” and then the two hemispheres act independently, their separate wills conﬂicting, and their separate thoughts being confused. For such cases, Wigan (1844) suggested that “a well-managed education” might serve to “establish and conﬁrm the power of concentrating the energies of both brains on the same subject at the same time.”
