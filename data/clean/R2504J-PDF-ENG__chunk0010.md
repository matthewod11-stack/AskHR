# and line graphs.

In this article we’ll explain why visualizations are so important to the

communication of strategy and describe, using a detailed example,

how to create one that will win buy-in from employees and investors

alike. We’ll conclude by showing that despite the powerful eﬀect

that a strategy visualization can have, only a quarter of corporate

presentations on deals include one, and when they do, it often isn’t

designed to have impact. All told, fewer than 20% of visualizations do an

eﬀective job of describing companies’ strategic decisions.
