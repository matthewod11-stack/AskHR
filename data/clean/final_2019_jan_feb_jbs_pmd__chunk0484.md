- 10. Funds Now, Atchayam is working on reducing the cost of its equipment, which will help it achieve break even faster. Currently, store break-even at the operating level takes six to 12 months, depending on location and size. While the first machine cost the firm nearly Rs 35 Lakh to set up because of the learning (technology) and subsequent corrections, it has since come down to Rs 14-15 Lakh. The aim is to lower the cost further to Rs 10 Lakh in the next year. Chamyvelumani has also applied for a patent for the technology, both in India and overseas. Foodboxstarted with Rs 4 crore from funding through family and friends and a private investor in the US . Now, it is looking for its next round of funding not only pan-India through tie-up with local restaurants but also in Singapore and West Asia. That means reaching out to more cities and restaurants across border also. “We see ourselves as facilitators for restaurant chains while solving an age-old problem of travelling families,” Satish Chamy Velumani says. For expansion, the Company takes the help of venture capitalists and angel investors to raise funds. Restaurants like the model because it increases sale s without too much investment. “Their packaging technology is superior. Also, we have restrictions in terms of having outlets in places such as railway stations and bus stands. This box can be set up easily,” says KT Srinivasa Raja, managing director of Adyar Ananda Bhavan. “For us, it saves the cost on establishing retail outlets. Once they reach the scale, I see a big scope for their service.” Therefore, it’s a win-win-win situation for partnering restaurants, customers and Foodbox. What is exciting and revolutionary about Atchayam’s Foodbox? The sustainability Factor:

- Multiple Restaurants at one place. Order from multiple restaurants & pick up at one point. It empowers and creates an ecosystem for the restaurants for a wider out-reach to its consumers and tap new markets.

- With the help of IoT (Internet of things) it makes a User-Friendly Ordering Station for better services.

- Ultra Quick Service - The food delivery mechanism is not just intelligent-it’s really fast. 90 seconds is the average time taken to serve a meal!
