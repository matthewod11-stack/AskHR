## In the television version of the motion picture The Enforcer, Clint Eastwood

as detective Harry Callahan, upon learning that he has been transferred from homicide to personnel, replies, “Personnel—only idiots work in personnel!” Although this statement is a bit strong, it represents the attitude many people hold about the field of human resources. That is, if you can’t do anything else, you can always work in human resources.

The image of the human resources (HR) field has been greatly enhanced in recent years, however, for the most part by its application of modern, scientific principles in employee selection and by the realization that properly designed employee selection procedures can save organizations a lot of money.

In this chapter, we will first explore ways to recruit employees and explain job hunting methods, and then discuss interviewing techniques as well as offer some tips that you can use to help find and obtain a desired job.

As shown in Figure ., certain steps can be taken to successfully choose employees. Some of the steps are designed to attract excellent applicants to the orga- nization, others are designed to select the best applicants, and still others are designed to give applicants a good image not only of the organization but of the job search process in general. Keep in mind that for most job openings, many more people will apply than will be hired. If you multiply the number of people who are not hired by the number of job openings each year, it is clear that a lot of people will be in contact with a particular organization. Those people not hired are potential customers, with friends who are also potential customers. Furthermore, applicants not hired for one position may turn out to be well qualified for future positions with the organization. Leaving them with a positive image of the company should be a priority.

As discussed in Chapter , job analysis is the cornerstone of personnel selec- tion. Remember, unless a complete and accurate picture of a job is obtained, it is virtually impossible to select excellent employees. Thus, during the job analysis process, in addition to identifying the important tasks and duties, it is essential to identify the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform the job.

Therefore, the methods used to select employees should tie in directly with the results of the job analysis. In other words, every essential knowledge, skill, and ability identified in the job analysis that is needed on the first day of the job should be tested, and every test must somehow relate to the job analysis. For example, if a job analysis reveals that an office manager types correspondence and proofreads reports to ensure that the reports are grammatically correct, then the battery of selection tests might include a typing test and a grammar test.

An important step in selecting employees is recruitment: attracting people with the right qualifications (as determined in the job analysis) to apply for the job. The first decision is whether to promote someone from within the organization
