## COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY BEFORE WORLD WAR I

Building on these foundations, comparative psychology emerged as a signiﬁcant, visible discipline during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the universities of the United States (see Dewsbury, 1992). Hall had been called to the presidency of Clark University and brought with him Edmund C. Sanford, who ran the laboratory. They taught courses and attracted students to comparative psychology. The laboratory course included work on microscopic ani- mals, ants, ﬁsh, chicks, white rats, and kittens. Graduate stu- dent Linus Kline (1899), who did some of the teaching, suggested that “a careful study of the instincts, dominant traits and habits of an animal as expressed in its free life—in brief its natural history should precede as far as possible any experimental study” (p. 399). The best known of the early Clark studies were those on maze learning published by Willard S. Small (1901). Kline mentioned to Sanford that he had observed runways built by feral rats under the porch of his father’s cabin in Virginia, and Sanford suggested the use of a Hampton Court maze as an analog of the learning re- quired of rats in nature (Miles, 1930). Small and Kline con- structed the mazes and other devices in which to study the learning process in rats. Thus, the early studies were designed to mimic situations the subjects faced under natural condi- tions. The Clark program was not limited to such studies. Under the inﬂuence of Hall, there was a strong developmen- tal focus, as in Small’s (1899) study of the development of behavior in rats and in Conradi’s (1905) study of the devel- opment of song in English sparrows. James P. Porter (1906) analyzed the naturally occurring behavioral patterns of two genera of spiders.

Robert M. Yerkes, under the inﬂuence of William James and Hugo Münsterberg, was a mainstay of comparative psychology during this period at Harvard. He studied the be- havior of a wide variety of invertebrates such as crayﬁsh (Yerkes & Huggins, 1903) and published one of the early classics of the ﬁeld, The Dancing Mouse (Yerkes, 1907), a comprehensive study of a mutant mouse strain. Yerkes and his students also studied a variety of behavioral patterns and species, including sensory function, such as Cole’s (1910)
