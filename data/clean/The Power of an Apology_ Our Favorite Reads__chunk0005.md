Now, when I’m shut down for saying sorry, specifically for sayingsorry because I’m a woman, I respond: “I don’t see my ability toapologize as a weakness. I think the world might be a kinder placeif people learned from us—the women who are brave and skilledenough to say sorry.”I ask you to consider this point of view. Maybe it’s time more of us

start apologizing—for the big and the little things—so there canbe less heartache, more reconciliation, and quicker restoration.When you have to cancel last minute on a friend, say sorry so theyknow you care about and consider their time. When you talk oversomeone in a meeting, say sorry so they know you value theirwords and ideas. When you hurt someone’s feelings, evenunintentionally, say sorry, because speaking the truth withcompassion can help them understand where you’re comingfrom. You can both gain closure and move on.Kindness and compassion are not things to be ashamed of. As wemove into the new year, I challenge us all to show more of them toourselves, and to each other. The world will be better for it.Recommended Reads
