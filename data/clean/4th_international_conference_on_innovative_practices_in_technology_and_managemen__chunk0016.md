# B. Random forest method (RFM)

One effective ensemble learning methodology that can be used to forecast employee attrition is the RMF. RM improves prediction accuracy and generalization by building several decision trees on various dataset subsets and combining their results via a voting process. This approach reduces over fitting to produce robust predictions and performs exceptionally well when dealing with skewed data, which is a common situation in attrition prediction. Moreover, the feature randomization the possibility of an excessive capability mitigates dependence on particular features [13, 14] RM ensemble approach maintains interpretability at the level of individual trees while adding to the overall robustness of the model. Customization is made possible by hyper parameter tuning, which makes RM a powerful and adaptable tool for handling the challenges involved in employee attrition prediction.

Within the field of human resource management, the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to employee attrition prediction presents an innovative method. CNNs, which are often used for image recognition, are modified in this context to evaluate sequential and tabular data. This makes it possible to spot complex relationships and trends in employee behavior over time. Deep learning capabilities combined with automatic feature extraction mean that CNNs might potentially identify subtle attrition-related characteristics that are difficult for traditional models to identify [15,16] For an implementation to be successful, data pretreatment, model architecture, and hyper parameter tuning must all be carefully considered. Despite being a novel methodology, CNNs' efficacy in predicting employee attrition should be carefully evaluated and contrasted with other approaches to make sure they are appropriate for the particular features of the dataset. D. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines (SVM) have emerged as a robust and versatile machine learning method for predicting employee attrition. SVM excels in handling both linear and non-linear relationships within the data, making it well-suited for the complexities inherent in attrition prediction. By effectively identifying decision boundaries and maximizing the margin between classes, SVM can discern patterns that contribute to attrition risk. Its ability to handle high- dimensional data and nonlinear relationships enables it to capture subtle features in employee datasets. SVMs can accommodate allowing customization to the specific characteristics of the attrition dataset [16] Moreover, SVMs offer interpretability through the identification of support vectors, aiding in understanding the key factors influencing attrition predictions. As with any modeling approach, careful parameter tuning and model evaluation are essential to optimize SVM performance and ensure its effectiveness in the context of employee attrition prediction. E.
