Overall, there was no consensus regarding educational attainment and its relationship with either job satisfac- tion or intent to leave. The inconsistent, yet sometimes signiﬁcant results allow for considerable confusion when attempting to interpret the importance and implications of educational attainment for retention.

It could be assumed from is these results that assessment of educational fraught with methodological challenges, or perhaps the samples were very distinct. Certainly the ﬁndings are mixed, and as such conclusions should be drawn with caution.
