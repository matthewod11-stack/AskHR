# The Humanizing of Psychology 485

agent’s mentality is actively structuring, not simply passively reactive, as it “comes at” experience. We actively organize the worldintomeaningfulunitsandthenrelatementallytothe “reality” that we have constructed. “While ‘real’ external reality may be presumed to exist independently of its appre- hension, it cannot be known except symbolically—as part . . . of psychic reality” (Edelson, 1971, p. 27). This is consistent to knowledge with recent “constructivist” approaches (Howard, 1991). Thus, people are very much engaged in the process of coping with the world.

Third, and of particular importance in this framework, “dialectical” thinking, the innate capacity to imagine alterna- tive or opposing conceptions of life situations, is frequently used by people to guide their behavior. With this capacity, people have an independent ability to determine the meaning of a given situation. In principle, they can fashion concep- tions of a situation that are contradictory to those given by the tradition of a particular authority. This mode of thought sup- plements the capacity that we also have to deﬁne our con- structions of the world in straightforward and unambiguous terms in order to negotiate our circumstances (what might be called “demonstrative” modes of thought, in Aristotelian terms). The point here is that African Americans have sur- vived their oppressive history in the United States because they have actively and intentionally brought to their lives conceptions of their competence that have been at variance with the judgments made of them by the majority society.

Let’s pursue this perspective a bit further and conclude with an illustration. Traditional psychological analysis has tried to identify the factors, such as biological drives or other kinds of contingent considerations, that necessarily deter- mine behavior. The telic-humanistic perspective by contrast is among those that argue that many human events happen in a context of possibility rather than necessity (Slife & Williams, 1995). That is to say, from a psychological point of view many situations in our lives, even from birth, are full of potentialities for action.

This quality of open alternatives in experience demands that the human being afﬁrm some . . . meaning at the outset for the sake of which behavior might then take place . . . [Afﬁrmation is] one of those active roles assigned to mind by humanists because which . . . item of . . . experience is singled out for identiﬁcation is up to the individual and not to the environment. (Rychlak, 1988, p. 295)

Such a conception highlights the place of choice and responsibility in human action. By contrast, mechanistic views try to account for behavior exclusively in terms of envi- ronmental contingencies and/or constitutional drive factors.
