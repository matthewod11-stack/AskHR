## Personality Traits and Behavioral Variability

Another line of research has focused on personality as density dis- tributions. Fleeson (2001), like Mischel and his colleagues, con- tends that individuals actively react to situations and that the same individual will behave differently across these different situational contexts over time. Consequently, the individual’s behavior can be conceived of as forming a distribution that can be partially ex- plained by personality constructs. More speciﬁcally, he contends that within-person variability is actually predictable as an individ- ual difference in reactions across different types of situations.

In a recent study, Fleeson (2001) examined within-person vari- ability and stability of the Big Five personality relevant behavior. He conducted three experience-sampling studies in which undergrad- uate students described how they were acting and feeling at ﬁve scheduled times per day for about three weeks. Results supported the notion that there is high within-person variability: individuals self-reported a wide range of levels of personality characteristics across situations. At the same time, their average or central ten- dencies were highly stable over time. He also showed that the amount of variability in the distribution of behavior (skew and kur- tosis) is a stable individual-difference construct. For example, he found that the amount of within-person variability in the Big Five personality construct of Extraversion reﬂected individual differences in a person’s reactions to situational contexts high on extraversion- relevant cues (time of day and number of others present). Some Big Five dimensions showed more variability across situations, such as Extraversion, more than others, such as Conscientiousness.
