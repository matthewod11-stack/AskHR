## receive training on safety and health topics.

The OSHA Outreach Training Program provides training for workers and employers on the recognition,

avoidance, abatement, and prevention of safety and health hazards in workplaces. The program also provides

information regarding workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to Ô¨Åle a complaint. This is a voluntary

program and does not meet training requirements for any OSHA standards. Through this program, workers can attend 10-hour or 30-hour classes delivered by OSHA-authorized trainers. The 10-hour class is intended

for entry level workers, while the 30-hour class is more appropriate for workers with some safety responsibility.
