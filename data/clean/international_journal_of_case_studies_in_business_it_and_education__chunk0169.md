# 11.1 Advantages:

(1) Increased employee well-being: Organizations can pinpoint areas for improvement and make plans to create a safer and more encouraging work environment by looking at how workplace culture affects employee mental health and well-being. This in turn may enhance workers' productivity, job happiness, and general well-being.

(2) Financial savings: Reduced absenteeism, presenteeism (being physically present but not completely engaged or productive), and turnover are all factors that can be expensive for businesses. Organizations may be able to cut these expenditures by understanding how workplace culture affects mental health.
