psychology and to develop knowledge about women’s psy- chological lives. Although Division 35 was born from the tense relationship between the AWPand the APA, it was from the ﬁrst independent of the AWP. The division developed an organizational structure that had little overlap with the AWP (Mednick & Urbanski, 1991; Russo & Dumont, 1997). In its ﬁrst year of existence, Division 35 voted to develop a journal to serve as the primary publication of research in the ﬁeld of feminist psychology. The division’s journal, Psychology of Women Quarterly, began publication in 1976.

Division 35 started with over 800 members and grew rapidly, becoming one of the largest divisions within the APA with more than 6,000 members by the year 2000. The growth of the division reﬂected the changing gender composition of American psychology. For example, in 1971, women earned 24% of all psychology doctorates compared to 66% in 1991 (Kohout, 2001). Between 1977 and 2000, the percentage of women APA members increased from 26.7% to 49.0%, and the high percentage of women in graduate programs suggests that this percentage will continue to grow.
