## Group-Level Personality Predictor Variables

The results of the few studies that have examined the relationships of group-level personality variables with individual- and group-level criteria are provocative. Fascinating results are emerging. For ex- ample, (1) dyad (group) levels of Extraversion and Conscien- tiousness correlate with relationship conﬂict, (2) although dyad levels of Conscientiousness correlate with relationship conﬂict, dif- ferences between dyad members in levels of Conscientiousness do not, and (3) Agreeableness and Openness correlate with relation- ship conﬂict at the individual level, although the strongest effects are at the dyad level (Bono, Boles, Judge, & Lauver, 2002). In an- other study, teams higher in Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Ex- traversion, and Emotional Stability received higher ratings on team (group level) performance, and teams higher on Extraversion and Emotional Stability received higher ratings on team (group level) viability (Barrick, Stewart, Neubert, & Mount, 1998). Using a con- junctive task, Neuman and Wright (1999) found that group-level Agreeableness and Conscientiousness predicted objective and sub- jective indicators of group-level (team) performance. Group-level Conscientiousness has both main and interaction effects on outcome
