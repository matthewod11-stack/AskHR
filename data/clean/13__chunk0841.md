# Humor and Performance Relevant Outcomes

In some cases, well-documented ﬁndings from considerable amounts of research on human resources topics are ignored by practitioners (Rynes, Brown, & Colbert, 2002). However, based on our reading of the current research literature on humor in organizations, in comparison with reports about humor appearing in the popular and practitioner literatures, the opposite might be true for humor. Speciﬁcally, empirical evidence for a link between humor and important performance-related outcomes is somewhat limited at this point, and seems to be far surpassed by the claims that are made about it, particularly in regard to claims made about performance.

One of the few exceptions is Susa’s (2002) dissertation study, which found that positive humor used in the work environment (deﬁned as ‘‘incongruity humor’’ and ‘‘relief humor’’) was related to higher job satisfaction, higher commitment levels, and higher performance ratings, whereas ‘‘negative humor’’ (deﬁned as ‘‘superiority humor’’) was negatively correlated with research linking humor and those organizational outcomes. Other performance or performance relevant outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction) seems to fall in one of two categories: performance-related outcomes that result from humor’s inﬂuence on positive affect, or performance-related outcomes caused by use of humor by leaders. In the sections below, we review the evidence for affect and leadership-related links between humor and performance.
