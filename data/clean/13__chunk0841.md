# HUMOR AND ORGANIZATIONAL OUTCOMES

In this section, we review evidence regarding the potential effects of humor in organizational contexts. In so doing, we make an effort to evaluate the weight of empirical evidence supporting each category of humor effects in organizations. Given that many of humor’s positive effects in organizations appear to be taken-for-granted in the practitioner- oriented literature, we hope this type of analysis will help focus researchers’ efforts toward research questions that need the most attention. In addition, we attempt to highlight the theoretical mechanisms that are likely involved in the causal relationships between humor and these outcomes. Again, we hope this will provide researchers with guidance in the design of future research on humor in organizational contexts.
