## 9.3.3 Disciplinary Process and Termination

In some cases, an employee may not respond to the feedback provided and may not make any improvements in terms of performance. In such cases, there is one interme- diate step that can be taken before the employee enters a formal disciplinary process which involves a verbal warning, a written warning, and may lead to termination. The employee can be given a once-in-a-career decision-making leave.41 This is a “day of contemplation” that is paid and allows the employee to stay home and decide whether working in this organization is what he or she really wants to do. This practice is based on adult learning theory, which holds individuals responsible for their actions. Unlike a formal disciplinary action, the decision-making leave does not affect employee pay. As noted by Tim Field, principal of a consulting firm in Los Angeles, California, “This element of holding people accountable without negatively impacting their personnel file or payroll tends to catch people off guard, because problem employees, like problem children, are often expecting negative attention for their bad behavior.” How can the decision to grant an employee a decision-making leave be communicated?
