## and development, empathetic listening, and care.

Building these new managerial skills requires work, but the rewards

are worth it: better performance, engagement, and retention, to name

but a few. And just like any muscle, it needs investment of time and

practice to strengthen. However, every organization can take positive

steps starting from within: Identify your best managers — the ones who

are already doing some of these things. Determine the speciﬁc habits

and behaviors that set them apart, then follow a “best teach the rest”

approach to help others learn how to develop similar capabilities. This

is beyond simple training; it is about teaching, coaching, role modeling,

and rewarding new ways of working every day.
