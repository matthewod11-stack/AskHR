# generous bonus.

- 6. Misleading customers. This tactic involves giving prospective

customers misleading information or withholding information to move

the sales process forward. At one ﬁnancial services company, some reps

would falsely tell call-in customers that the transaction couldn’t be

completed on the phone and encouraged them to meet with a ﬁnancial

adviser, which yielded them higher bonuses for in-house referrals.

- 7. Falsifying data. In this case, the sales management system is fed

false information or information is omitted to maximize incentive

payouts. In one interview, we heard that sales reps often log in to

sales management systems and add their names to deals they did not

participate in to increase their bonuses.
