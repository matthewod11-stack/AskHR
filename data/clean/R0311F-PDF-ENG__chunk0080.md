## Coming Up Short on Nonfinancial Performance Measurement

In short, the refinement process should be never ending. Beneath the proven drivers of performance lie the drivers of those drivers. Since a business can’t ever know whether it’s gone deep enough, the effort to uncover these drivers must never cease.

Ultimately, the conclusions drawn from data analyses must be used in decision making if nonfinancial per- formance measures are to improve financial results. And clearly, companies should act on the conclusions that appear to promise the greatest financial reward. For example, a major finance company found that, in ascend- ing order of importance, employee satisfac- tion, quality (the number of processing mis- takes), and customer satisfaction were the fundamental drivers of financial perfor- mance. Consequently, the company began re- quiring managers to base their recommenda- tions for allocating capital according to the drivers’ relative importance. It also required them to explain how success in these three realms would be measured and to estimate the financial payback in these three areas.
