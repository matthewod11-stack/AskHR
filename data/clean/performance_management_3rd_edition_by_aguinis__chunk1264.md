# 7.2 COMMUNICATION PLAN

In general, having more and better knowledge of the performance management system leads to greater employee acceptance and satisfaction.1 Organizations often design a communication plan to ensure that information regarding the performance management system is widely disseminated in the organization. Agood communication plan answers the following questions:2

- What is performance management? Answering this question involves providing general information about performance management, how performance manage- ment systems are implemented in other organizations, and the general goals of performance management systems.

- How does performance management fit into our strategy? To answer this question, we should provide information on the relationship between performance management and strategic planning. Specifically, information is provided on how the performance management system will help accomplish strategic goals.

- What’s in it for me? A good communication plan describes the benefits of imple- menting performance management for all those involved.

- How does it work? Answering this question entails giving a detailed description of the performance management process and time line: for example, when meetings will take place, what the purposes of each meeting are, and when decisions about rewards will be made.

- What are my responsibilities? The communication plan should include information on the role and responsibilities of each person involved at each stage of the process. For example, it includes a description of the employees’ and supervisors’ main responsibilities in the performance management process.

- How is performance management related to other initiatives? The communication plan should include information on the relationship between performance management and other initiatives and systems such as training, promotion, and succession planning.
