# Part II • System Implementation

however, the system cannot be implemented successfully if only a handful of organiza- tional members are on board.

Before the system is launched, a successful communication plan must be imple- mented that will gain system acceptance. Part of the communication plan includes a description of the appeals process. Then, as part of the preparation phase before the system is actually launched, raters are trained to observe and evaluate performance as well as to give feedback. The system should then be tested, and the results of a pilot test should be used to fix any glitches. Only after these presystem implementation steps are taken can the system be launched with confidence. Finally, after the system has been tested and launched, there is a need to monitor and evaluate the system on an ongoing basis to determine whether it is working properly and what adjustments may be needed to make it work. The ongoing monitoring of the system is crucial because the system may eventually lose support if no data are provided to show the system’s benefits.

Next, let’s discuss what needs to be done before the system is actually implemented, including formulating a communication plan, establishing an appeals process, training raters, and pilot testing the system.
