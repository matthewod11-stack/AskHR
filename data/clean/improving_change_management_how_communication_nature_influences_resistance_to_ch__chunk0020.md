## extensive alteration towards a communicative aspect of the change process:

“Resistance, properly understood as feedback, can be an important

resource in improving the quality and clarity of the objectives and

strategies at the heart of a change proposal. And, properly used, it can

enhance the prospects for successful implementation”. (Ford and Ford,

2009: 103)

This approach is supported by other scholars. According to Schein (2003),

dealing with defensive routines requires supplying a space for reflection and dialogue.

Moreover, Ford, Ford et al (2008) reflects that when much responsible insight about

resistance is present, one that considers it as a result of an agent’s own actions and

sensemaking, the agent can purposely opt to make sense of recipient expressions as a

counter offer. Therefore, in this case the role of change agent definitely includes taking

charge of the change dialogues in order to overcome apparently resistive behaviors “by

bringing both agent and recipient background conversations to the fore” (2008:373). A

truly provocative idea is that expressing opposition can be, in fact, a sign of deep

commitment to change by being brave enough to show concern about obstacles not yet

seen(Stohl and Cheney, 2001: 380).

Due to this more comprehensive point of view on resistance to change, it is

necessary to recognize that the term should be altered purposively as a response to

change, echoing Dent and Golberg (1999) and Oreg’s (2006) claims that the expression

resistance to change is limiting and not adequate. In this literature review, such

alteration emphasized the nature of subjective experiences in order to obtain a more

valid understanding of what resistance is actually about. On the other hand, as the

predominant term used in the literature provided on the empirical studies of the

phenomena is resistance to change, it will be useful to adopt the same term and
