# Early Attempts at Classiﬁcation

For many centuries, the dominant view held that mental ill- ness, although differing in symptoms and severity, is funda- mentally one general disorder called melancholy. However, in the seventeenth century, a view began to develop that mental illness is an umbrella term encompassing a number of distinguishable mental diseases. Robert Burton (1651/1927) wrote, “Some confound melancholy and madness, others say melancholy is madness differentiated not in kind but in extent or degree, some acknowledge a multitude of kinds and leave them indeﬁnite.” This view became popular after the discov- ery that mental illness as well as physical diseases differ not only by symptoms but also by cause.

In the nineteenth century, attempts were undertaken to identify and classify types of mental illness on the basis of clusters of symptoms, etiology, course, and response to treat- ment. The view that psychopathology is a general pathology again emerged in the middle of the twentieth century when learning theorists proposed that psychopathology represents maladaptive responses to stress, and psychoses differ from neuroses on a dimension of severity, unless the pathology had been clearly determined to be caused by a demonstrable lesion of the nervous system.

Today it is again generally held that diagnostically distinct psychopathologicaldisordersexistthatdifferinsymptoms,eti- ology, course, and response to different kinds of treatment.
