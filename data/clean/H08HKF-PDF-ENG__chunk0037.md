## other stakeholders (e.g., vendors, suppliers, strategic partners, etc.). It

also competes with other strategic priorities and contends with limited

resources. For this reason a phased rollout of the RAI program is highly

recommended. In other words, taking baby steps to implement an RAI

program is highly recommended. However, this must be distinguished

from taking baby steps in the design of the program. The program

should be designed as fully as possible prior to implementation.

An analogy is helpful. If you ultimately want a building with four wings

but you only have the resources to build one of those wings, you would

do better to complete the design of the four-wing building and then

build in phases than you would to build a single wing and ﬁgure out

later how to make additions to what you’ve already built. Similarly, it

is better to design a complete RAI program and build in phases than

to build a bit now and ﬁgure out later how to tack on other elements.

Fortunately, completing design of an RAI program requires far fewer
