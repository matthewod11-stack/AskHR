# Original Research

Perceived social support Zimet et al.’s (1988) Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) was used to measure the degree to which a person recognises social support from significant others, family and friends. The scale consists of 12 Likert- type items. It has been found to be reliable in other contexts, such as an alpha of 0.83 in the African context (Nakigudde et al. 2009), 0.73 in a cohort of war veterans (Wilcox 2010) and 0.91 in the context of Thailand (Wongpakaran, Wongpakaran & Ruktrakul 2011). In this study, the alpha value was 0.924.

that multicollinearity was not a threat to the interpretation of the results. Overall, for most of the variables, skewness was within the acceptable limits of ±2 (Field 2000).

In order for nominal variables to be included in the regression analysis, this study made use of dummy variables, which are often used in the investigation of the influence of categorical variables (Holgersson, Nordström & Öner 2014; Yip & Tsang 2007). Linear regression models can only be used when there is a quantitative dependent variable, as well as quantitative continuous or dummy predictive variables (Çilan & Can; 2014; Gujarati & Porter 2009).

Ethical consideration This study adhered to the various ethical guidelines. An Ethics Clearance Certificate was issued after the study was approved by the University of Witwatersrand’s ethics committee (protocol number CBUSE/1233, 25 May 2017). The confidentiality and anonymity of the research participants was respected. The research respondents were made aware that their participation was voluntary, and respondents were given the freedom to withdraw at any given time. Most importantly, informed consent was obtained prior to the participation of the respondents. Ethical standards were maintained throughout the processes of the study.

Data analysis Univariate analysis was performed to check for missing values. The biographical and demographic profile of respondents is reported in Table 1. Descriptive statistics are reported in Table 2. Multiple linear regressions were utilised to test hypothesised direct, mediated and moderated relationships. Hypothesis testing was performed using a significance level of 5%, or α = 0.05. The PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes 2013) was used for analysis. Assumptions of the regression analysis process were assessed, including the assumptions of normality of residuals, homoscedasticity and multicollinearity.

Therefore, seeing that many predicative variables in surveys are often categorical, they need to be converted to dummy variables linear regression models. For this reason, the creation of dummy variables is acceptable practice in regression analysis (Gujarati & Porter 2009).

in order to use traditional

Stevens (1946) outlines the four types of scales that include interval, nominal, ordinal and ratio data. The various types of scales can be distinguished by the group of transformations each can be subject to without losing empirical information (Stevens 1946). According Gujarati (2011), nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales are typically used in quantitative analysis.

Results and discussion The results of the hypothesis testing are now reported and discussed:

H1: Increases in work-life balance conflict are significantly associated with increases in intent to quit.

Model 1 includes the covariate factors, namely age, gender and race dummies, and number of dependents.

Residual plots were inspected, and histograms were plotted for residual values. On the basis of these plots the residual distribution was taken to approximate normality. This suggested little evidence of heteroscedasticity. Variance inflation tests were performed to test for multicollinearity. These values were also taken to provide reasonable evidence

Table 3 reports the results of the tests of the hypotheses. After including our variable of interest, WLBC, its coefficient is significant (p = 0.0001), over and above the influence of the covariates. The null hypothesis is rejected. These results differ from those of Riley (2006) who found no relationship between work-life balance and turnover intention. These findings suggest that, at least in terms of this core relationship,
