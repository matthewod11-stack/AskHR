## demonstrates intentionality and alignment with your career growth.

Highlight the reasons for each move — were you seeking to develop

speciﬁc skills that are now crucial for the role you’re applying for? Did

a former manager or colleague recruit you because they valued your

expertise? Mentioning this highlights your professional reputation. If

you changed industries or shifted careers, explain how the transition

was a strategic step that prepared you for the responsibilities of the

position you’re pursuing. In continuing the previous example:

After ﬁve years at [agency name], a former manager recruited me

to join [new company name] as an International Senior Media

Planner. This move allowed me to build on my expertise planning

and executing multi-channel campaigns for global brands.
