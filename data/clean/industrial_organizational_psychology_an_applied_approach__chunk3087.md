Russia invaded Georgia in part over disputed territory, in the early s Iraq invaded Kuwait under the pretense that Kuwait actually belonged to Iraq, and in the s, England and Argentina fought over who had the right to the Falkland Islands. In cities, jurisdictional ambiguity is often a cause for gang wars. Communication Barriers Communication barriers are the fourth cause of conflict. The barriers to inter- personal communication can be physical, such as separate locations on different floors or in different buildings; cultural, such as different languages or different customs; or psychological, such as different styles or personalities. An in-depth discussion of the communication process can be found in Chapter . Beliefs A fifth cause of conflict is the belief systems of individuals or groups. Conflict is most likely to occur when individuals or groups believe that they: 7 7 7 are superior to other people or groups have been mistreated by others are vulnerable to others and are in harm’s way 7 7 cannot trust others are helpless or powerless (Eidelson & Eidelson, ) Personality A sixth cause of conflict can be found in the personalities of the people involved. Conflict is often the result of people with incompatible personalities who must work together. For example, a person who is very quality oriented will probably have conflicts with a person who is very quantity oriented. Likewise, a “big pic- ture” person is likely to have conflicts with a “nuts and bolts” person. Though it is probably true that most of the conflict attributable to personal- ity is the result of incompatibility, it is also very true that certain people are gen- erally more difficult to work with than others. For example, it has been suggested that people who are dogmatic and authoritarian and have low self-esteem are involved in conflict more often than open-minded people who feel good about themselves (Bramson, ; Brinkman & Kirschner, ). Little research has gone into investigating “difficult people” who are most likely to cause conflict, but a fair amount has been written about the topic in the popular press. For example, Bernstein and Rozen () describe in great detail three types of “neanderthals at work”—rebels, believers, and competitors—and how conflict with each can be managed. The most commonly referred to classification of difficult people was devel- oped by Bramson () and enhanced by Brinkman and Kirschner (). The latter postulated that abnormally high needs for control, perfection, approval, or attention form the basis for the difficult personality. People with high needs for control are obsessed with completing a task and take great pride in getting a job done quickly. Among such personality types are the Tank, who gets things done quickly by giving orders, being pushy, yelling, and at times being too aggressive; the Sniper, who controls people by using sarcasm, embarrassment, and humiliation; and the Know-It-All, who controls others by dominating conversations, not listening to others’ ideas, and rejecting arguments counter to her position. People with high needs for perfection are obsessed with completing a task correctly. They seldom seem satisfied with anyone or any idea. These personal- ity types include the Whiner, who constantly complains about the situation but never tries to change it; the No Person, who believes that nothing will ever work and thus disagrees with every suggestion or idea; and the Nothing Person, who responds to difficult situations by doing and saying nothing—she simply gives up or retreats. People with high needs for approval are obsessed with being liked. Their behavior is often centered on gaining approval rather than completing a task correctly or quickly. The Yes Person agrees to everything and, as a result, often agrees to do so much that she cannot keep her commitments. The Yes Person seldom provides feedback to others because she is afraid of getting someone mad at her. The Maybe Person avoids conflicts by never taking a stand on any issue. She delays making decisions, seldom offers opinions, and seldom commits to any course of action. People with high needs for attention are obsessed with being appreciated. They behave in a manner that will get them noticed. When she doesn’t feel appreciated, the Grenade throws a tantrum: She yells, swears, rants, and raves. The Friendly Sniper gets attention by poking fun at others. Unlike the Sniper, the group behavior, teams, and conflict 501
