“Of course they are!” Jackie said. “That’s a huge priority for all of us. But what does it mean in the context of this decision?”

They’d been going back and forth about this for a while now and kept ﬂip-ﬂopping. John, however, had declared a pref- erence. He conceded that both candidates were well qualiﬁed but liked that Nolan would bring diversity to his all-Asian team. “Right,” said Alex. “That’s what John keeps driving home. If we looked at our company as a whole, we’d hire Catherine—a woman of color—for noticeable diversity that would show up in our metrics and in the executive photos on our website.” They had talked before about the diﬃculty of accurately measuring diversity: For example, only some observ- ers considered sexual orienta- tion as well as race and gender identity, so Alex’s being gay often didn’t count.7

“Exactly,” Jackie said. “Plus it would signal to our employees that DEI is a priority. And we know representation matters. If Catherine did end up succeeding John, she’d increase diversity on our board. But, to John’s point, this hire will be working in China, not Canada. Nolan may not be a member of an underrepresented group here at headquarters, but he is in Asia. He says he’s often the only non-Chinese person in meetings and at factories.”8

Alex nodded. “And Nolan’s work experience and perspective are diﬀerent from mine or yours or John’s or anyone else’s on the executive team. Catherine seems more aligned in her thinking with the rest of us.”

“But we can’t forget that Cath-

erine would bring an American perspective to an Asian team,” Jackie replied. “And being a woman also brings a diﬀerent viewpoint.” They’d discussed

this point many times, especially regarding the Asia division, which was 70% male. They both knew that in executive ranks it was all too common for the only woman to be, like Jackie, in a support role such as HR.

“Women are the ones buying our toys for their children,” Alex mused. “Of course, Nolan is the one with kids…” He stood and started pacing. “I’m reminding myself that this is a good problem to have. We’ve got two extremely strong candidates, and either one can help us meet our goals.” Juno had just logged the best quarter in its history, and he wanted that success to continue.9

“They bring diversity in dif- ferent ways,” Jackie said, point- ing to the DEI statement pinned to her wall. Alex glanced at it, remembering the hours they’d spent poring over the wording. They’d outlined important and lofty goals, but it was challenging
