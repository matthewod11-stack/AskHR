## Find a climate consistent with your leadership style.

Change your leadership style to better fi t the existing climate.

Change your followers’ perception of the climate.

Change the actual climate.

Although there is continual debate about whether a person can be trained to be a leader, a meta-analysis by Collins and Holton () supports the effectiveness of leadership training. Thus, those who are willing to use different leadership styles can learn the necessary skills and behaviors through training programs.

The third method by which a person can become an effective leader is to change followers’ perception of the climate so that the perception matches the leader’s behavioral style. This tactic is common in politics, in which each candidate tries to convince the voting public that he or she is the best person for an office.

The fourth method by which a leader can become effective is by actually changing the climate itself rather than simply changing followers’ perceptions of the climate. Obviously, this is difficult to do, but it is the strategy advocated in Fiedler’s Leader Match training. Such a strategy is difficult but can be successful.
