# Subordinate Ability

An important influence on leader effectiveness is the abilities and attitudes of the leader’s followers and how these abilities and attitudes interact with the style and characteristics of the leader (Hollander & Offermann, ). House () believed a leader’s behavior will be accepted by subordinates only to the extent to which the behavior helps the subordinates achieve their goals. Thus, leaders will be success- ful only if their subordinates perceive them as working with them to meet certain goals and if those goals offer a favorable outcome for the subordinates.

Because the needs of subordinates change with each new situation, supervi- sors must adjust their behavior to meet the needs of their subordinates. That is, in some situations subordinates need a leader to be directive and to set goals; in others, they already know what to do and need only emotional support. Leaders who adapt their behavior to match the needs of their subordinates will be more effective than leaders who stick to one leadership style (Foster, ).

According to House’s path–goal theory, a leader can adopt one of four behavioral leadership styles to handle each situation: instrumental, supportive, participative, or achievement-oriented.

The instrumental style calls for planning, organizing, and controlling the activities of employees. The supportive-style leader shows concern for employ- ees, the participative-style leader shares information with employees and lets them participate in decision making, and the leader who uses the achievement- oriented style sets challenging goals and rewards increases in performance.

Each style will work only in certain situations and depends on subordinates’ abilities and the extent to which the task is structured. In general, the higher the level of subordinate ability, the less directive the leader should be. Likewise, the more unstructured the situation, the more directive the leader should be (Schriesheim & DeNisi, ).

House and Mitchell () further advise that to be effective, a leader should:

recognize the needs of subordinates and work to satisfy those needs reward subordinates who reach their goals help subordinates identify the best paths to take in reaching particular goals clear those paths so that employees can reach their goals

Path–goal theory is intuitively appealing because it gives a manager direct advice about how to behave in certain situations. Furthermore, because it is behavior based rather than trait based, the theory could be used in training.

Unfortunately, a meta-analysis of the research on path–goal theory has not supported its general effectiveness (Wofford & Liska, ). If path–goal theory is to have real impact, it will need further revision.

Another theory that focuses on the relationship between leader and follower is the situational leadership theory developed by Hersey and Blanchard (), who postulated that a leader typically uses one of four behavioral styles: delegat- ing, directing, supporting, or coaching. Hersey and Blanchard termed the most important follower characteristic follower readiness, or the ability and willingness to perform a particular task. The degree of follower readiness can be measured by either the manager’s rating form or the self-rating form developed by Hersey and Blanchard. Scores from these forms place followers into one of four catego- ries, or readiness (R) levels:

R: Unable and unwilling or insecure R: Unable but willing or conﬁ dent R: Able but unwilling or insecure R: Able and willing or conﬁ dent

As shown in Figure ., for R followers, the most effective leader behavior is the directing approach. That is, the leader directs the follower by telling him what to do and how to do it. A coaching approach should be used with R follow- ers because they are willing to do the work but are not sure how to do it. Leaders using this approach explain and clarify how work should be done. R followers are given plenty of emotional support as well as opportunities for two-way com- munication. This approach is successful because these followers already know what to do but are not sure whether they want to do it. R followers are most productive and happy when a delegating leadership style is used. These follow- ers are both willing and able to perform the task. Thus, the only real job for the leader is to delegate specific tasks to subordinates and then let them complete those tasks with minimal supervision or guidance.

Under this theory, effective leaders first diagnose the competency and moti- vation levels of employees for each goal or series of tasks, and then adapt their leadership style to fit the employees’ level. As an employee makes developmen- tal progress, the leader changes styles and becomes less directive. It is impor- tant for leaders to discuss this strategy with each employee so that employees will understand why they are being treated a particular way (Blanchard, Zigarmi, & Zigarmi, ).

As with many theories of leadership, situational leadership theory has excel- lent intuitive appeal and has been successful in some organizational applications (Gumpert & Hambleton, ) but not others (Goodson, McGee, & Cashman,
