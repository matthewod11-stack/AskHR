## less preparation than some of the other coaching styles.

The Telling style is best used when you’re coaching an employee

whose job is standardized and includes repetitive tasks (for example,

a call center associate or an assembly line manager). It is also suitable

for when the task or individual requires more oversight, like a new

data entry executive or a recently hired social media associate. This

Telling style can also be beneﬁcial in situations that require urgent

or immediate action. However, you should use it sparingly and with

caution. A directive style can stiﬂe creativity and demotivate your

employees, as it can make them feel that they lack the autonomy

to learn and grow. When you overuse this style, you could also be

perceived as micromanaging your employees.
