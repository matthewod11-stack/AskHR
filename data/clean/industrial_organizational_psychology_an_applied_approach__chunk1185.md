# Integrity Tests

Integrity tests (also called honesty tests) tell an employer the probability that an applicant would steal money or merchandise. Integrity tests are used mostly in

the retail area, and more than  million are sold each year. Such extensive use is due to the fact that % of retail employees, % of fast-food employees, and % of hospital employees have admitted stealing from their employers (Jones & Ter- ris, ). One study estimates that % of employees with access to cash steal from their employers (Wimbush & Dalton, ). Another study found that % of retail shrinkage is due to employee theft, % to shoplifting, and % to admin- istrative error or vendor fraud (Ryan, ). With increases in employee theft and identify theft, it is not surprising that integrity tests are commonly used.

Prior to the s, employers used both electronic and paper-and-pencil integrity tests to screen applicants. In , however, the U.S. Congress passed the Employee Polygraph Protection Act making general use of electronic integ- rity tests, such as the polygraph and the voice stress analyzer, illegal except in a few situations involving law enforcement agencies and national security.

The law did, however, allow the use of paper-and-pencil integrity tests, which are either () overt or () personality based (Sackett & Wanek, ). Overt integ- rity tests are based on the premise that a person’s attitudes about theft as well as his previous theft behavior will accurately predict his future honesty. They mea- sure attitudes by asking the test-taker to estimate the frequency of theft in society, how harsh penalties against thieves should be, how easy it is to steal, how often he has personally been tempted to steal, how often his friends have stolen, and how often he personally has stolen. Personality-based integrity tests are more gen- eral in that they tap a variety of personality traits thought to be related to a wide range of counterproductive behavior such as theft, absenteeism, and violence.

Overt tests are more reliable and valid in predicting theft and other coun- terproductive behaviors than are personality-based tests (Ones, Viswesvaran, & Schmidt, ; Snyman et al., ). In addition to predicting counterproductive behavior, both overt and personality-based integrity tests have been shown to predict job performance (Ones et al., ) and have low levels of adverse impact against minorities (Viswesvaran & Ones, ).

There are many integrity tests on the market, several of which do a decent job of predicting either polygraph results or admissions of theft (Ones et al., ; Snyman et al., ). Unfortunately, few studies have attempted to correlate test scores with actual theft. Of course, these would be difficult to conduct. Instead, the validity of integrity tests has been determined by comparing test scores with:

polygraph test results, self-admissions of theft, shrinkage (the amount of goods lost by a store), known groups (e.g., priests vs. convicts), and future theft.

Unfortunately, all of these measures have problems. If polygraph results are used, the researcher is essentially comparing integrity test scores with the scores of a test—the polygraph—that has been made illegal partly because of questions about its accuracy. If self-admissions are used, the researcher is relying on dis- honest people to be honest about their criminal history. If shrinkage is used, the researcher does not know which of the employees is responsible for the theft or, for that matter, what percentage of the shrinkage can be attributed to employee theft as opposed to customer theft or incidental breakage. Even if actual employee theft is used, the test may predict only employees who get caught stealing, as opposed to those who steal and do not get caught. The problems with known- group comparisons will be discussed in great detail in Chapter .

Predicting actual theft from an integrity test can be difficult because not all theft is caused by a personal tendency to steal (Murphy, ). Normally honest peo- ple might steal from an employer due to economic pressure caused by factors such as high debts or financial emergencies or by an organizational culture in which it is considered normal to steal (e.g., “It’s OK because everyone takes food home with them”). Employee theft can also be the result of a reaction to organizational policy such as layoffs or a change in rules that employees perceive as unfair. To reduce theft caused by situational factors, nontesting methods such as increased security, explicit policy, and availability of appeal and suggestion systems are needed.

Although paper-and-pencil integrity tests are inexpensive and may be use- ful in predicting theft, they also have serious drawbacks. The most important disadvantage might be that males have higher failure rates than do females, and younger people have higher failure rates than do older people. Adverse impacts on these two groups pose little legal threat, but telling the parents of a -year- old boy that their son has just failed an honesty test is not the best way to foster good public relations. Failing an integrity test has a much more deleterious psy- chological impact than failing a spatial relations test. For this reason, some legal experts advise against letting applicants know that they were not hired because they failed an integrity test (Douglas, Feld, & Asquith, ).
