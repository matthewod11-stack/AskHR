models can also be applied to discover the most optimal solution within a set of predefined

assumptions and constraints. Such models include various mathematical programming models

and AI heuristics, such as genetic algorithms. These approaches collectively enable a

comprehensive analysis of the data, providing valuable insights and facilitating informed
