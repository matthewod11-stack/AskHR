## feedback, secure funding, and form collaborations. The OpenIDEO

team developed an online platform where venture founders can share

weekly progress updates and ask questions. Matt Ridenour, who led

the Food Waste Alliance, shared resources, invited guest experts,

and encouraged participants to share tools, guidelines, best practices,

challenges, and even grant opportunities. In-person events, including a

series of pitch days that paired founders and investors, were organized at the IDEO oﬃce in San Francisco.

Rise Products, a food start-up that upcycles organic by-products,

was one of the beneﬁciaries of that eﬀort. Thanks to the funding it

received from another Alliance member, Rise was able to prototype

a process for transforming barley waste from beer brewing into

ﬂour for baked goods. The two cofounders also participated in a

conference organized by the Alliance in San Francisco, where they met

other entrepreneurs, including some who would eventually start an

upcycled food association that Rise joined. Reﬂecting on the Alliance

experience, one of Rise’s cofounders says, “In addition to capital

(funding opportunities, prototyping facilities) and access (sharing of

existing infrastructure and knowledge), I’d say the most important

resources were networking (sharing of personal connections) and

storytelling (sharing of experiences). It helped us realize that we were

not alone and that people faced similar challenges.”

Although Silicon Valley celebrates “moving fast and breaking things,”

that approach is unsustainable. Hackathons and open-innovation

challenges can and do generate promising ideas, but they all too often

fail to achieve greater impact because most new ventures get too little

support for the people dynamics of collaboration. And while some

intermediaries, entrepreneurship hubs, and accelerators oﬀer more

structured, network-based support in the early phases of new venture
