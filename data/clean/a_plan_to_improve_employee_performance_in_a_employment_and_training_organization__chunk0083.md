# comprehensive performance evaluations .

The new performance evaluation system will serve several useful functions:

- 1) To r~view progress against standards and to collect data for the evaluation.

- 2) To determine what standards of performance are app_ropriate for the work to be

performed by the employee, which should be changed, which should no longer be

appropriate and which new standards are needed.

- 3) To review performance standards to see whether they are adequate or need to

be revised.

- 4) To analyze what areas the employee is deficient in knowledge or skill so the

supervisor can act as a coach to eliminate any deficiencies .

- 5) To determine any additional assistance to help the employee improve his/her

performance and outline a plan for improvement.

When conducting a performance evaluation the goal should be to determine whether the

performance standards for an employee are being achieved and whether they are being

met and to what degree. Also, we are determining whether the employee's skill level is

appropriate to the tasks of the job. During the performance ev~luation, the supervisor

must act as a coach and identify how the employee could be more effective. Then, work

out an improvement plan outlining what could be done so performance standards will be

met or most likely to succeed in achieving those standards.
