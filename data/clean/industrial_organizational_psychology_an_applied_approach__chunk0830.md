# Affirmative Action

On the basis of this definition, the courts have ruled such conditions as an ear infection (Juanita Caldwell v. Kentucky Fried Chicken, ) or a cold/flu (Miller v. AT&T, ; Rose Rankin v. Seagate Technologies, ) to be serious.

If employees take advantage of family or medical leave, the organization must continue the employees’ health-care coverage and guarantee them that when they return they will either have the same or an equivalent position. In return, employees must provide a doctor’s certification and give  days notice if the leave is foreseeable (e.g., birth or adoption). Employees on FMLA leave from one company cannot work at another job (moonlight) during that period (Pharak- hone v. Nissan North America, Inc., and Rodney Baggett, ).

To protect employers from potential problems in complying with the FMLA, Congress allows them to exempt their key employees from using it. “Key employ- ees” are the highest-paid % in the organization. Other than record-keeping headaches, however, the FMLA has not resulted in many hardships for most organizations (Martinez, ).

The extent of family leave in the United States is similar to that in many countries. For example, laws in other countries mandate unpaid leave of  weeks in Belgium,  days in Brazil, and, depending on the province,  to  weeks in Canada. Mexico mandates  weeks and the European Union  weeks of paid leave. In England, employees who have been with an organization less than  weeks are entitled to  weeks of unpaid leave, employees with  weeks to one year of service are entitled to  weeks of paid leave, and employees with more than one year of service are entitled to  weeks of paid leave.

Affirmative action is one of the most misunderstood legal concepts concerning employment. Although most people associate affirmative action with hiring goals or quotas, there are actually four main affirmative action strategies.

Affirmative Action Strategies Monitoring Hiring and Promotion Statistics One of the primary affirmative action strategies is for organizations to monitor their hiring, placement, and promotion rates for men and women and minorities and nonminorities. Though such monitoring is a good idea for all organizations, it is mandatory for federal contractors, for banks, and for educational institu- tions that receive federal funds. Such organizations must write affirmative action plans in which they monitor adverse impact as well as compare the percentages of women and minorities in the organization with the percentages of women and minorities in the qualified workforce.

Intentional Recruitment of Minority Applicants A common affirmative action strategy is to target underrepresented groups for more extensive recruitment. Such efforts might include advertising in magazines and newspapers with a minority readership, recruiting at predominantly minority or female universities, visiting minority communities, or paying current employ- ees a bonus for recruiting a member of a protected class.

A related technique is to establish training programs designed to teach minorities the skills needed to obtain employment with the organization. For example, Hogan and Quigley () found that providing a six-week exercise program would result in fewer female applicants failing physical ability tests for positions such as firefighter.

Identifi cation and Removal of Employment Practices Working against Minority Applicants and Employees A third affirmative action strategy is to identify and remove practices that might discourage minority applicants from applying to an organization or minority employees from being promoted within an organization. Such practices might involve company policy, supervisor attitudes, or the way in which an organization is decorated. For example, an African American employee in a southern city filed a lawsuit alleging race as the reason he wasn’t promoted. As evidence, he cited the embroidered Confederate flag hanging in his supervisor’s office. The city’s affir- mative action officer suggested that the flag be removed because, even though the supervisor was a Civil War enthusiast rather than a racist, a Confederate flag in a supervisor’s office might give the perception of institutional acceptance of racism. As another example, it is a common practice for police applicants to receive information and obtain employment applications from the police department itself. However, many minorities are uncomfortable with the idea of going to a police station and asking White police officers for information and applica- tion materials. As a result, an easy affirmative action strategy would be to have employment applications available only at the city’s personnel office.

When your author presented the above example to a meeting of police chiefs, the overwhelming response was, “How can someone be a cop if they don’t feel comfortable going to a police station?” I responded that it is uncomfortable for anyone to go into a new environment, much less one with the stigma associated with a police station. I then told the group a story of how scared I was when, back in high school, I had to go to a police station to register a car rally that our school group was having. I still recall the icy stare and gruff voice of the desk sergeant, which quickly turned my legs to jelly. When a few others in the crowd joined in with similar stories, it drove home the point that there are many things, seem- ingly trivial, that deter others from applying for jobs.

Preferential Hiring and Promotion of Minorities This is certainly the most controversial and misunderstood of the affirmative action strategies. Under this strategy, minority applicants will be given preference over an equally qualified nonminority applicant. It is important to note that in no way does affirmative action require an employer to hire an unqualified minor- ity over a qualified non minority. Instead, affirmative action requires employers to monitor their employment records to determine whether minority groups are underrepresented. If they are, affirmative action requires that an organization do the best it can to remedy the situation. One such remedy might be preferential hiring and promotion. The legality of preferential hiring and promotion will be discussed later in the chapter.
