Utilize unused or underused spaces. By deﬁnition, micro-nature is

small, and can be as simple as painting a wall with natural tones, adding

ﬂowers to the break room, or landscaping the area outside employees’

windows. We encourage managers to keep an eye out for the unused or

underused spaces around their workplace that can be easily and cheaply

turned into natural features. For instance, adding more landscaping to

an overly industrial parking lot may boost employees’ morale.

. . .

Overall, our ﬁndings indicate that the beneﬁts of connecting employees

to nature at work extend beyond sustainability, and include positive eﬀects on employees’ well-being and how they perform their jobs. As

such, we view contact with nature as a valuable supplement to well-

designed jobs that already include meaningful work, fair compensation,

and respectful treatment. For ﬁrms that provide these things and are

looking for more ways to enhance the environment in which their employees work, micro-nature oﬀers considerable promise.
