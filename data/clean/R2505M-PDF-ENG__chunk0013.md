## Perhaps the most popular approach to business innovation

is breakthrough thinking. It’s the 10x, winner-takes-all model

characterized by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra to “move fast and break

things.” Here the innovator, typically an entrepreneur armed with a new

piece of technology, ignores existing relationships, norms, and even

laws to create a better product.

For example, when Google set out to improve its search engine, it

didn’t ask permission to make use of people’s personal information.
