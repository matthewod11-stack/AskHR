## Fear-Based Culture: Low Connection, Low Courage

There is a third culture type that acts as a barrier to people taking risks

to do hard things: fear-based. In this culture, which made up 16% of our

sample, teams have both low connection and low courage.

This type of team culture can feel similar to a transactional culture, but

it is characterized by inconsistency and unpredictability. At least in a

transactional culture, people know how their manager is going to show

up. In fear-based cultures managers are all over the place: sometimes

they provide feedback and are open to listening to team members,

but other times they oﬀer no feedback and do not listen. This lack of

consistency creates great anxiety and causes people to feel like they are

walking on eggshells. They stop taking risks, such as speaking up when

they see something wrong or when they have an idea that could help,

for fear of personal judgment. The groupthink that happens is less about

not wanting to upset others, as in a family culture, and more about

self-preservation. People don’t want to put themselves in harm’s way.
