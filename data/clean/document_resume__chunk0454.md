# Subordinate Appraisal

Appraisal by subordinates is the opposite of super\ isory appraisal and the advan- tages and disadvantages are reversed. The major advantage is that such appraisals are highly democratic and they encourage participative management. This type of appraisal is often seen as illegitimate because it undermines the superior's rightful authority. Also a superior is already being appraised by subordinates, albeit indirectly. The superior's rating is usually influenced by husk well or poorly the subordinates perform their work.
