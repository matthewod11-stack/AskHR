## In the book High Output Management, former Intel CEO Andy Grove

discusses the concept of “managerial leverage” — the actions leaders

can take to increase the output of their organization. He identiﬁes

training as “one of the highest-leverage actions a manager can perform.”

As part of our eﬀorts to build a leadership development culture, we’re

training our leaders to seize upon teachable leadership moments. These

can be formal opportunities — for example, we design nearly all of our

training programs to be at least partly leader-teacher led. We try to

structure these opportunities so that the leader is teaching about a topic

they have passion for and sharing lessons from their own experiences
