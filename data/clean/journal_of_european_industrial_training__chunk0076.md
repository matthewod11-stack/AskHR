the nature of peer interactions is not perhaps conducive to peer feedback since peers do not necessarily have the opportunity to observe appraisee performance.

Barclay and Harland (1995) use the

literature on procedural justice and fairness as a framework for examining the acceptance problems associated with peer feedback. They outline some of the features that are associated with fair and just systems. These include: procedures that suppress bias, procedures that are correctable, procedures that are applied consistently across people and over time, procedures that are ethical, and procedures that use accurate information to make decisions (Barclay and Harland, 1995). They conducted their research among public health nurses in the USA. They concluded that a peer system using raters with higher levels of education and experience was viewed as fairer and more satisfying than a peer system using raters of lower education and experience. This finding suggests that a rating system where raters are perceived as competent by ratees leads to higher levels of acceptance because the system is viewed to be fair and just. They also report that respondents were more willing to accept a peer appraisal system which is ``correctable'' because it is perceived as being a fair system. By ``correctable'', Barclay and Harland (1995) mean a peer appraisal system where the ratee is offered an opportunity to correct appraisal errors.

Fedor et al. (1999) suggest that an

organisation should consider the following issues when implementing a peer appraisal system in order to increase employee acceptance. First, they point out that the developmental nature of the peer feedback should be stressed. Second, employees should feel that they are actively involved in the system and that they have a ``voice'' in the decision-making process. Third, they argue that raters should be able to see the value of their efforts in the peer assessment system and that the feedback should be seen as a valuable tool for performance improvement. If these conditions are met, they argue that stakeholders in the peer appraisal process will be more positive towards and more likely to accept this approach to performance appraisal.

Peer feedback effectiveness A significant area of research interest in the peer appraisal literature is that of determining the impact that the adoption of such an appraisal system can have on subsequent employee behaviour. Druskat and Wolff (1999) examine the immediate and

longer-term impact of a structured, face-to- face developmental peer appraisal on self- managed work groups. They found that structured, face-to-face peer appraisals can have an immediate positive impact on group member perceptions of open communications, group task focus, group viability and member relationships. These concepts are explained below.

Task focus, in the context of Druskat and Wolff's (1999) research, refers to the extent to which individuals are motivated to achieve their tasks and goals and also the absence of ``social loafing''. They define group viability in terms of a group's ability to continue working together effectively. Open communications basically refers to the fact that members felt that communication flowed more effectively between members of the group after peer appraisal. Finally, member relationships essentially refers to the extent to which members are satisfied with the group and feel that the group is cohesive. These findings are encouraging for organisations using or planning to introduce peer feedback systems, or the broader concept of 3608 feedback, especially in organisations where there is a strong emphasis on teamwork. However, in Druskat and Wolff's research site, the respondents did not indicate that peer feedback was useful for individual development purposes.

An important research finding on the

timing of peer appraisal is reported by Druskat and Wolff (1999). They found that enduring team skill development as a result of the feedback depended on the timing of the feedback relative to a group's project deadline. Their findings suggest that there is an optimal period of time during a task group's life when the group and its members are most likely to develop, learn from and change as a result of peer feedback. This period of time is ``before the group is engaged in project execution but not so far in advance of this period that the project is not yet a priority''. It follows from Druskat and Wolff's findings that timing is an important consideration for organisations using peer feedback because it influences the effectiveness of the feedback as a developmental tool.

Dominick et al. (1997) report one of the most comprehensive studies on the impact of the effectiveness of peer feedback on employee behaviour change. They set out to examine whether behaviour in team settings could be changed by the administration of a feedback intervention and whether feedback or exposure to behaviours that lead to effective team performance was the critical factor in producing behaviour change.
