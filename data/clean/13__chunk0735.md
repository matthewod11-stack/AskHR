ROBERT ZINKO ET AL.

The proposed conceptualization of personal reputation in organizations addresses the formation or development of reputation, which is an important part of the construct, but does not completely exhaust the full extent of the phenomenon. Indeed, once reputations are formed, they must be maintained, which involves some of the same processes that are discussed in this paper, particularly regarding the demonstration of consistent reputation-appropriate behavior over time. However, other processes may be involved in reputation maintenance. Additionally, the defense of a reputation involves more proactive and even aggressive attempts to polish up a perhaps tarnished image, which also goes beyond the scope of the present conceptualization. Ferris et al. (2003) have explicitly addressed issues regarding both reputation maintenance and defense in a preliminary manner. However, more speciÔ¨Åc theory and research is needed in the future.
