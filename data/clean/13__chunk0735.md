# CONCLUSION

Individual reputations represent a yet largely unexplored aspect of how people interact within organizations. The proposed conceptualization of personal reputation integrated a number of mutually reinforcing behavioral science theories in an effort to systematically articulate how reputations at work are formed or developed. Indeed, reputation may begin to address some of the inconsistent ﬁndings in research to date. Additionally, the potential implications of knowledge about personal reputation for what we know and think about managing human resources are signiﬁcant, and may be of considerable interest to managers.

Certainly, reputations are likely an important consideration when making decisions to hire, retain, or promote individuals organizations. Finally, research on reputation offers promising insights into how and why certain individuals are valued more or less than others within speciﬁc contexts. Personal reputation may signiﬁcantly contribute to our understanding of the interactions of individuals in organizations, and therefore, represents an important and exciting area for future research. We hope the present paper stimulates further work in this area.
