## HBR / Magazine Article / Case Study: Navigating Labor Unrest

not lead to future layoﬀs, something that seemed impossible to provide,

considering his conversation with headquarters. Most troubling of all

was the demand that no artiﬁcial intelligence or algorithmic decision-

making be introduced into production without the approval of the

union, to ensure that AI would not be used as a substitute for workers.

Paulo shook his head. That was a totally unreasonable request. Though

AI was still a frontier technology in car production, who knew what

advances might emerge as cars increasingly became “computers on

wheels”? His ability to make quick decisions to stay competitive could

be undermined by a participatory process.

He wasn’t even sure whether the union was negotiating in good faith.

Just last week, in an interview with a local news channel, Lucia had

referred to Luna as a “corporate villain” and painted the union’s struggle

as a ﬁght against greed. He knew that Lucia had political ambitions.

Was she actually hoping for a deal, or would she throw her own workers under the bus to be seen as tough and further her political career? 6

His phone buzzed. It was a text from Lucia. “Thoughts?” it read.

He hesitated for a moment before typing, “I’m thinking some of these

requests are unreasonable.”

Her response was instant. “That’s a shame. I guess you want a strike?”

Memories from the last strike, of a cacophony of shouting voices,

angered faces, and idle machinery, ﬂashed through Paulo’s mind. “You’re bluﬃng,” he responded. “Would you really send your workers

to the picket lines now, when the future of the plant is at stake?”
