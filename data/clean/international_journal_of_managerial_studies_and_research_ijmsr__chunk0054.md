A 4-point Likert-type questionnaire scale was designed for the study. Section A consisted of closed-ended questions. Sections B, C, D and E used a structured 4-point modified Likert-scale battery of strongly agree (4), agree (3), disagree (2) and strongly disagree (1) in line with Atiku, Genty and Akinlabi (2011). The respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree/disagree with various statements.

The data collected by administering the research instrument were analyzed in line with each research question and hypothesis. Descriptive statistics (such as frequencies and percentages) were used to answer the research questions. The Friedman Test was used to analyze the hypotheses. The SPSS version 17 for windows (a computer based statistical program me) was used to run all the analyses for the study. The decision rule follows: at 0.05 level of significance, reject null hypotheses for tests with probability estimates lower than 5% (0.05) and conclude that they are statistically significant. Otherwise, we accept (when probability estimates are above 0.05) and conclude that there is no overall statistically significance. 5. PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS Out of the 400 questionnaires distributed, all the 400 were properly completed and returned. The return rate is (100%).
