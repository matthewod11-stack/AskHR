## HBR / Digital Article / Research: How to Build Consensus Around a New Idea

of our study is it does not explore the opposite extreme of groupthink,

where new ideas may be hindered because evaluators agree too much.

Group discussions can lead people to converge too much, but this

research investigated people judging value separate from the inﬂuence

of others. Our research oﬀers useful ﬁndings for managers wading

through wide ranging opinions and contention around new ideas, and

oﬀers solutions for how to get employees on the same page, creating

avenues to submit meaningful evaluations for a novel concept.

Understanding why people are more likely to disagree about the value

of creative ideas creates opportunities to anticipate when a lack of

consensus may occur. Understanding lack of consensus is a signal to

investigate, assess, and weight the reasoning diﬀerent evaluators are

using will help facilitate thoughtful decisions, helping overcome what

otherwise can be a meaningful barrier to innovation.
