# Ensuring Transfer of Training

When an organization spends time and money on training, it expects that the knowledge will be transferred to the job. Unfortunately, this is often not the case (Broad, ). Research in learning has indicated that the more similar the train- ing situation is to the actual job situation, the more effective training will be. In other words, the transfer of training will be greater. This principle is extremely important when a training program is being chosen or designed. For example, if a restaurant is training its employees to wait on tables, the training will be more effective if the employees can practice in an environment that is similar to that encountered when they actually work. This realism might even include “custom- ers” complaining and changing their orders.

An excellent example of making training more realistic comes from the French police. After examining the use of force by officers, Contournet () found that officers most often use their weapons at night, when they are tired after many hours on their shift. Training in use of weapons, however, was con- ducted in the morning, when cadets first started their day. To ensure better trans- fer of training, shooting simulations are now being conducted during both the day and the evening hours.

Another way to increase positive transfer of training is by having the trainee practice the desired behavior as much as possible. Such practice is especially important for tasks that will not be performed on a daily basis after training has been completed. For example, if a firefighter is learning to perform CPR, he must overlearn the task through constant practice. This overlearning is essential because it may be months before the firefighter will practice what he has learned. In contrast, once our electronics assembler learns a task during training, it is time for him to move to another task. Overlearning is not necessary for the coil winder because he will perform the task every hour once training has been completed.

The term overlearning does not have the same meaning in training that it has on most college campuses. In training, overlearning means practicing a task even after it has been successfully learned. Many students, however, think of overlearn- ing as the negative consequence of “studying too hard.” Although it is commonly

believed that one can study too hard and “overlearn” the material, research does not support the conclusion that this type of overlearning occurs or has negative consequences. Therefore, no one will be hurt by studying a little longer. In fact, a meta-analysis by Driskell, Willis, and Copper () indicates that overlearning significantly increases retention of training material.

Finally, to further increase the transfer of training, practice in as many dif- ferent situations as possible should be provided. For example, we might have our electronics assembler wind coils as fast as possible, wind them slowly, and wind them in various sizes. In this way, the employee will be better able to deal with any changes that occur in the job.

For information learned in training to transfer to behavior on the job, employees must be given the opportunity and encouraged to apply what they have learned (Broad, ; Ford, Quiñones, Sego, & Sorra, ; Tracey, Tannen- baum, & Kavanagh, ). Employees are more likely to be given opportunities to perform what they learned if their supervisor perceives them to be compe- tent and the organizational climate is supportive (Baldwin & Ford, ; Ford et al., ). Though this seems obvious, research indicates that many employers are neither supportive nor provide opportunities for employees to apply what is learned—especially if the training was in the form of employees going to school to work on a degree (Posner, Hall, & Munson, ). Transfer of training also can be increased by teaching concepts, basic principles, and the “big picture” rather than just specific facts or techniques.
