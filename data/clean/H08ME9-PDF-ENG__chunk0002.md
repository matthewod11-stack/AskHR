You probably know that to succeed in your role, you need to align with

your manager’s priorities. In an ideal world, all leaders would be clear

about their expectations and proactive about sharing what’s on their

mind. But in reality, most bosses can be frustratingly vague. They might

launch into a rambling explanation that leaves you more confused than

when you started. Or perhaps you’re told to “just keep doing what you’re

doing” or brusquely brushed oﬀ as they rush to their next commitment.
