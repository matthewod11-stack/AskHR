# CHAPTER 3

Situational and Motivational Inﬂuences on Trait-Behavior Relationships Murray R. Barrick Terence R. Mitchell Greg L. Stewart

Social cognitive theory suggests that a full understanding of human nature requires the study of three components: the person, the sit- uation, and behavior (Bandura, 1986). A great deal of research in industrial/organizational psychology over the past hundred years has focused on the ﬁrst component: the person. Considerable work has been invested in identifying which traits characterize an indi- vidual’s personality and thereby make him or her different from other people. Today, a consensus has emerged that the second-order structure of personality consists of ﬁve (plus or minus two) major personality dimensions, known as the Big Five. In the past decade, a number of meta-analyses (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp, & McCloy, 1990; Hurtz & Donovan, 2000; Salgado, 1997) have shown that two of the ﬁve personality dimensions, Con- scientiousness and Emotional Stability, predict performance out- comes in many, if not all, jobs, while the other three personality traits (Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience) are re- lated to performance in some jobs or for speciﬁc criteria.
