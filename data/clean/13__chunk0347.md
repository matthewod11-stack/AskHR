predictors in other longitudinal phenomena, even though work on the implications of performance trends is still in its early stages.

Investigations in this third stream of dynamic performance research show that performance trends are both predictable and related to outcomes of interest. As a result, it seems clear that, consistent with the conclusions of many in the second stream of research reviewed above, selection devices need to be considered not just in terms of their validity at a point in time (or even validity at several points in time), but in terms of how well they predict performance trends. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of perfor- mance and the predictability of performance trends suggest for essentially all areas of human resource research interested in the prediction of job performance ratings, it would provide a more accurate understanding of performance to consider the predictability of performance levels and trajectories.
