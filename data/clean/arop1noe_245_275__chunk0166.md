# Social Exchange

Employees often learn through interacting with others (e.g., peers, mentors, supervisors, and customers). Below we discuss research on the role of social networks, development networks and mentoring, supervisor support, and trust and fairness perceptions in facilitating learning.

Social networks. Recent research emphasizes that learning and the transfer of training occur throughsocialnetworks.Korte(2009)concludedthatrelationshipbuildingwastheprimarydriver of socialization for new hires and that the work group, not the organization, was the primary context for socialization. Van den Bossche et al. (2010) found that transfer of training was positively associated with the number of ties in trainees’ social networks. Researchers have also begun to examine ways to facilitate the building of relationships as well as the factors that foster learning from those relationships. Lawson et al. (2009) investigated cross-organizational re- lationship building with supplier organizations. They found that informal socialization mecha- nisms (e.g., communication guidelines, social events) played an important role in facilitating interorganizational knowledge sharing, whereas formal socialization mechanisms (e.g., cross- functional teams, matrix reporting structures) acted indirectly through informal socialization to influence knowledge sharing.

Climate, structure, leadership, resources, and experience have also been shown to facilitate learning from relationships. Carmeli et al. (2009) demonstrated that high-quality relationships contributed to perceptions of psychological safety, which in turn related to learning behavior. Hannah & Lester (2009) suggest that dense and well-defined learning networks are needed to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge but that to promote creativity, innovation, and exploration, network clusters should be kept semiautonomous from other clusters. Larsson et al. (2011) found knowledge brokering (i.e., connecting various knowledge sources) was a primary function of informal leaders who gained authority from expert knowledge and access to important in- formation. Finally, Gardner et al. (2012) examined a team’s relational and experiential resources andfoundthatthedistributionofbothresourcesaidedinthedevelopmentoftheteam’sknowledge integration capability for simpler tasks, but it created dysfunctional assumptions with more dynamic uncertain tasks.

Development networks and mentoring. Prior research has demonstrated that learning occurs from mentoring relationships. Recent research has examined factors that directly or indirectly influencelearningfrommentoringrelationshipsandtheroleofnontraditionalformsofmentoring onlearning.Panetal.(2011)foundthatself-efficacymoderatedthemediatedeffectsofsupervisory mentoring on job performance and career satisfaction through personal learning.
