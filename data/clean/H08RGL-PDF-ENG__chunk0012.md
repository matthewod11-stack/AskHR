## HBR / Digital Article / Research: When Help Isn’t Helpful

- 2. Optimistic Expectations and Lack of Accountability

Fuzzy asks often led help-seekers to assume their needs were

understood—and would be met. This created what we describe as

optimistic expectations: the belief that givers could solve the problem.

Givers often felt pressure to say yes but didn’t always follow through. In

Amy’s case, many agreed to help, so Amy hoped they would solve the

problem. She stopped working on other solutions. When givers failed to deliver, the problem had become that much more diﬃcult and urgent.

- 3. An Emotionally Charged Aftermath

Unhelpful help doesn’t just derail projects—it damages relationships

and morale. Recipients often felt misled and unsupported. In Amy’s

case, the lack of follow-through made her feel undervalued. As she put

it, “If Glow thinks this is what I’m all about, to make sense of things that

are all crazy and just to hold it together, I don’t want to. That shouldn’t

be my value here.”

Givers didn’t fare much better. Some felt their contributions were

ignored or misused. Without feedback, they couldn’t know whether

they’d made a diﬀerence—or how to improve next time.
