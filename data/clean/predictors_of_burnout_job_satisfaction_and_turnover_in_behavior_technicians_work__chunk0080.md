Implicit attitudes towards children with ASD and typi- cal development (TD) were also found to be significantly correlated with burnout in behavior technicians working in an ABA school (Kelly and Barnes-Holmes 2013). Increased implicit negative attitudes towards children with ASD were found to be positively correlated with burnout, and increased positive attitudes towards children with TD were found to be negatively correlated with burnout. On the other hand, both positive attitudes towards children with ASD and negative attitudes towards children with TD were not found to be correlated with burnout (Kelly and Barnes-Holmes 2013).

Other factors were found to be related to burnout in behav- ior technicians working in ABA schools. Coping strategies were found to be significant. Particularly, wishful-thinking coping was found to be associated with greater levels of burn- out (Griffith et al. 2014). In addition, Gibson et al. (2009) found both commitment to philosophy and perceived thera- peutic self-efficacy to be protective against burnout (Gibson et al. 2009).

General demographic factors (i.e., age, education, experi- ence) were not found to be related to burnout (Gibson et al. 2009; Griffith et al. 2014; Hurt et al. 2013) or intention to turnover (Kazemi et al. 2015) in behavior technicians.
