# Organizational Factors

Organizational factors were investigated by four of the studies (Gibson et al. 2009; Griffith et al. 2014; Hurt et al. 2013; Kazemi et al. 2015). Table 3 provides a summary of the orga- nizational factors explored in the reviewed research.

Supervisor support was given the most attention across the reviewed research. Greater satisfaction with supervisor sup- port was found to be associated with lower levels of burnout (Gibson et al. 2009; Hurt et al. 2013), greater levels of job satisfaction (Hurt et al. 2013), and less intention to turnover (Kazemi et al. 2015). Perceived supervisor support was also found to moderate the effects of work demands on burnout (Gibson et al. 2009) and partially mediate the effects of per- sonality traits on job satisfaction (Hurt et al. 2013). Findings on the significance of supervisor support were not entirely consistent. Perceived supervisor support was not found to be associated with burnout in a sample of behavior technicians working in ABA schools (Griffith et al. 2014). Griffith et al. (2014) suggest that their contrasting findings may be due to including a greater portion of behavior technicians with supervisor-level roles as compared to Gibson et al. (2009), and the authors speculate that supervisor support may have less of an impact on those behavior technicians.
