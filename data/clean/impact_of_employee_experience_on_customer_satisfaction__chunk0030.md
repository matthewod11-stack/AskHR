The customer experience is not a new concept at all and it is well known by most

companies. According to a Bonfyre study (Stolpe, 2022), today 89% of companies

focus mainly on delivering a differentiated customer experience. However, the

employee experience is a growing field which has the potential to become equally as

important as the customer experience. In fact, the employee experience controls the

nearly 80% of executives rated the Employee Experience as top priority, as very

important or very important for their business strategy. Only 22% of executives have

been able to successfully implement an employee experience program within their

companies. (Flynn, 2017) A Gartner study on the Top 5 priorities for HR Leaders in

2020 indicates the Employee Experience as one of the key priorities among all HR

initiatives. The biggest challenges, based on a Gartner survey in 2020, the future of

HR is linked to culture where 23% of HR leaders see a struggle and 15% see a

challenge in measuring the impact of investments in the employee experience.

Why are executives giving greater attention to the employee experience? In the

environment we live in today, people have an infinite number of alternatives for what

number of possibilities to decide where they want to work and what should be their

profession. A great customer journey is strongly related to employee engagement and

happiness, which has become a key competitive advantage. Customers who are

satisfied with the service they receive are more likely to purchase the product again,

generating additional business, and helping the organization deliver shareholder

value. Simple as it is, when company culture allows employees to grow, where they

are treated well and are happy, employees can engage in their work and find greater

purpose. They are then eager to satisfy their customers and also generate satisfaction
