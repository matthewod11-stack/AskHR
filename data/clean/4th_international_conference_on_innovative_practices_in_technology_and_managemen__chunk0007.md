Abstractâ€”Analytics is described as a methodical progression and a set of statistical tools. To put it another way, it's the science of analysis. HR analytics is a methodical discovery and quantification of the people-related aspects that drive business results. It involves demonstrating the direct influence of people data on crucial business outcomes. HR analytics is positioned as a critical requirement for businesses and forecasts employee attrition. Organizations are confronting increased complexity as a result of the spike in employee resignations and the challenges in re-engaging them. This is especially true given the growing prevalence of remote work, which makes it difficult for managers to identify dissatisfied workers. Furthermore, the transition to virtual work has made it more challenging to onboard new employees because there are less options for traditional in-person training and shadowing. To deal with these complexities, businesses are using AI more and more to tackle these complex issues. HR managers may ensure optimal outcomes that benefit customers and stakeholders by strategically allocating resources to staff with the help of HR analytics. This study adopts various supervised AI methods are to demonstrated and assess for the prediction of employee turnover within an organization.

to plan retention strategies authorizes HR managers efficiently, empowering them to identify and retain valuable employees (IBM Inc., 2018) [3]. This study delves into the application of MI methods and various classification algorithms to automate the prediction of attrition. Supervised ML, includes the exploration for algorithms that develop general hypotheses from provided occurrences, assisting forecasts about future events. This study adopts various tools and techniques of ML on predicting employee turnover.

II. RELATED WORK Plethora of studies works have explored into how AI and ML can be used in HRM, with a focus on hiring new employees and keeping existing ones. The advancement of technology has been significant in improving the effectiveness of organizations by eliminating human bottlenecks and cutting down on repetitive work. An analysis by [5] demonstrates how businesses may use AI and machine learning to analyze large datasets and accomplish better results. This research's main objective is to understand how ML and AL can improve worker behavior and productivity
