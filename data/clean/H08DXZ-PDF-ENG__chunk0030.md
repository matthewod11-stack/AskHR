# counter-proposals.

- 3. Balance inquiry with relationship-building.

You may have uncovered your counterparts’ interests and constraints

like a pro, but you’re still unlikely to get those extra concessions if

they don’t like you. Make sure you strategically balance “why,” “what,”

and “how” questions throughout the conversation to gather in-depth

information and build and maintain good rapport.

Negotiation is a core leadership and life skill — one that inﬂuences

everything from the prices we pay and the salaries we earn to who

picks up the kids from school. Despite its pervasiveness, people often

overlook a simple strategy to achieve better outcomes: asking more

open-ended questions, a strategy that is much easier if you spend just

a couple of minutes brainstorming open-ended questions before the

negotiation begins.
