## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

And the fourth of the trends, and this one’s been going a long time,

is that what we expect out of a job has changed a lot. It used to be

providing a stable living. [Now] we want everything from our jobs.

We want passion, we want purpose. We want self-fulﬁllment. We want

huge loss, because it was what we did, it was the people we spent time

with, it was what structured our time. We built up to that. We invested in

that. The sense of psychological loss is a big barrier.

The last is that increasingly, particularly from mid-career on, when we
