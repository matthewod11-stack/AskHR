The training method (e.g., programmed instruction, behavioral modeling, lecture) must be a good match for the employeeâ€™s learning style, ability, and personality. The training method must be a good match for the type of material being learned (e.g., knowledge vs. a physical skill). The training program must allow for goal setting, positive feedback, distributed practice, overlearning, and the chance to practice and apply the material learned (transfer of training). There must be an opportunity and encouragement to use the newly acquired knowledge at work.
