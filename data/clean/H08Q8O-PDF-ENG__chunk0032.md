## Leaning into these questions, Carlos Mendes Gonçalves, CEO of Casa

Mendes Gonçalves (CMG), one of the largest producers of vinegar and sauces in the Iberian Peninsula, has taken a very diﬀerent approach

from leaders who have adopted a blanket approach to RTO. In multiple

interviews with him, we have observed that his approach to hybrid

working and communicating with employees is consistent with what

you would expect from a leader guided by an ethics of care.

First, asking what is right, Gonçalves wondered how he could on the one

hand ask the 350 factory workers to be on-site ﬁve days a week while oﬀering a hybrid model for the 100 employees in the oﬃce. So when

the new HR director joined in September 2024, Gonçalves told her that

she needed to implement a four-day week in the factory to compensate

for the fact that factory workers cannot beneﬁt from hybrid work. This

way, Gonçalves reasons, both groups get a boost to their well-being,
