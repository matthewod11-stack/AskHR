# hypothesis”: in corporate takeovers the overconfidence of individual decision makers

often results in bidding firms paying too much for their targets. What he had in mind

is a type of winner’s curse in merger fights. Roll’s hubris hypothesis may be best

summarized by a famous quote from the 1981 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report:

Many managements apparently were overexposed in impressionable childhood

years to the story in which the imprisoned handsome prince is released from a

toad’s body by a kiss from a beautiful princess. Consequently, they are certain

their managerial kiss will do wonders for the profitability of Company T[arget]....

We’ve observed many kisses but very few miracles. Nevertheless, many managerial

princesses remain serenely confident about the future potency of their kisses-~even

after their corporate backyards are knee-deep in unresponsive toads.

(Taken from Weston et al. 1998)

Confirming this hypothesis, Malmendier and Tate (2003) find that a firm is indeed

significantly more likely to acquire another firm if the CEO is overconfident. In a

sample of CEOs from Forbes 500 companies in the 1980s and the first half of the

1990s, Malmendier and Tate find that overconfident CEOs are about 1.7 times as

likely to conduct a merger in any given year as their rational counterpart. Here,

the measurement of overconfidence is not based on responses to questions, but on

actual personal portfolio decisions. The authors point to the high degree of under-

diversification, which high-ranking executives face due to their stock-based com-

pensation and the investment of their human capital in their firm, and argue that
