# CONCLUSION

Peter Drucker noted that in the 20th century, great leaders gave great answers; in the 21st century, great leaders will ask great ques- tions. In organizational settings, as is the case for their counterparts in professional sports, leaders may not necessarily be as adept or knowledgeable of the areas requiring coach- ing, as is the person who is being coached. Thus, becoming an expert on ‘‘the answers’’ is now, and will continue to be, all but impossible. The effective coach is one who questions and listens. Insightful questions lead to reﬂection; they lead to self-discovery. The arguable downside of becoming an effective coach is the queue; people seek out those who listen to them. However, as Colin Powell has observed, the day people stop bringing a person their problems is the day that person has stopped leading them. People have either lost conﬁdence that the person can help them, or they have con- cluded that the person does not care. Either case, argued Powell, is a failure of leader- ship. Together, performance appraisals that lead to ongoing coaching ensure a highly trained, highly motivated workforce. It is the essence of performance management.
