# Supervisors

By far the most common type of performance appraisal is the supervisor rat- ing. In fact, Bernardin and Beatty () estimated that more than % of all performance appraisals are conducted using supervisors’ ratings of performance. Though supervisors may not see every minute of an employee’s behavior, they do see the end result. A supervisor may not actually see a teller sign up custom- ers for Visa cards but will review the daily sales totals. Likewise, a professor does not see a student actually research and write a paper but infers the levels of these behaviors by viewing the results—the finished term paper.
