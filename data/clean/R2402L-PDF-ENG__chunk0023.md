# to a stop.

Open questions encourage people to speak freely and to share their

side of the story, thus revealing more about what’s important (or not) to

them, the lines they can’t or won’t cross, and areas where compromise

might be possible. They help you buy time, gather data, clear up

misunderstandings, and defuse emotions, because they force others to

really consider their answers and potential solutions, rather than give a

knee-jerk yes or no to an idea or unthinkingly choose between options

you’ve presented.

Good open questions start with “What” or “How”—for example, “What is the real issue?” “How will this aﬀect [the party or situation involved]?”

“What has to happen for you to [desired action]?” “What other options

do we have?” Avoid questions that begin with “Why,” because they can

sound accusatory and judgmental. For example, with a client who is

threatening to switch service providers, instead of asking, “Why do you want to leave?” consider “What are they oﬀering that we don’t?” or

“What could we do to make you stay?”

Keep it simple and focused on one topic at a time. Avoid jargon and

abstract words or ideas. And then, after you’ve asked your question, stay

quiet and give the person time to fully answer. Try also to encourage

an exchange of questions, rather than letting it feel like a one-sided
