Likewise, truly excellent employees probably have been promoted. Thus, employee performance is distributed in a nonnormal fashion.

Perhaps another way to look at this concept is by examining the grades given in a class. When students ask an instructor to “curve” a test, technically they are asking her to force their grades into a normal curve—that is, there will be approx- imately % As and % Fs. (Of course, what these students are really often asking for is extra points.)

Suppose that you are at the bottom of your class, yet you still have a % average on class exams. Do you deserve an F? What if you are the last person in the D category, and a student withdraws from the class with two weeks to go. To keep the distribution normal, you are given an F. Do you consider this fair?

Perhaps the greatest problem with all of the employee-comparison methods is that they do not provide information about how well an employee is actually doing. For example, even though every employee at a production plant might be doing an excellent job, someone has to be at the bottom. Thus, it might appear that one worker is doing a poor job (because she is last), when in fact she, and every other employee, is doing well.

Objective Measures A second way to evaluate performance is to use what are commonly called objec- tive, or hard, criteria. Common types of objective measures include quantity of work, quality of work, attendance, and safety.

Quantity of Work. Evaluation of a worker’s performance in terms of quantity is obtained by simply counting the number of relevant job behaviors that take place. For example, we might judge a salesperson’s performance by the number of units she sells, an assembly line worker’s performance by the number of bum- pers she welds, or a police officer’s performance by the number of arrests she makes. Even Oprah Winfrey is evaluated on the number of viewers who watch her show.

Although quantity measures appear to be objective measures of performance, they are often misleading. As shown in Figure ., it is important to realize that many factors determine quantity of work other than an employee’s ability and performance. Furthermore, for many people’s jobs it might not be practical or possible to measure quantity; computer programmers, doctors, and firefighters are examples.
