Reﬂect and reevaluate. The chaos and tumult could be a catalyst for

reevaluating your current position and considering what you want out

of your career, according to Roberts. “People don’t often take the time

to assess their strengths, talents, and priorities as it relates to their

work.” She suggests checking in with yourself. What do you want to

accomplish? What’s important to you? You might ﬁnd that you’re mostly

satisﬁed with your job and professional life; or you might decide it’s

time to explore new opportunities or make changes. “There are so

many things you don’t have control over, but you do have control over

deﬁning success for yourself and how you position yourself to achieve

it,” she says. “This might be the push you need to do that.”
