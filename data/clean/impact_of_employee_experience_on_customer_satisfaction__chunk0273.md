## customer satisfaction with the company and their level of loyalty. The author

constructed a customer survey based on seven questions which generate an NPS

score and customer touchpoints. The NPS question measures customer loyalty to

Atlas Copco company through Q1- “How likely are you to recommend Atlas Copco

company to a friend or colleague?” From 90 customers who responded to the author’s

survey, 37 are loyal customers who intend to promote Atlas Copco, keep buying

products and services, and have strong partnership behavior, 34 customers are

neutral, typically satisfied but unenthusiastic and who are open to competitive

offerings, and 19 customers are not loyal to company, there is a high probability that

they will not buy products or services in the future, and do not consider Atlas Copco

as potential future supplier. They can potentially damage brand reputation. In the

author’s NPS survey, the Atlas Copco score of 20 is a good result based on the

industrial average, whereas European customers ranked experience with Atlas Copco

company the worst, scored at 3.23. US and China customers evaluate the company

significantly better where the NPS score for US market is 23.33 and in China 33.33.
