# Development Issues

A variety of development issues arises when one considers either adopting, adapt- ing, nr developing a performance appraisal procedure. The first and most important of these issues is the determination of the purpose of the appraisal procedure--the use of the resulting data. If the purpose of procedure is to make large-scale summatke, insti- tutional judgments, one's focus would be quite different than if the focus were to iden- tify strengths and weaknesses with a view toward employee growth development. Each of these widely differing purposes and many purposes between these two exam- ples will serve to establish the frame-of-reference for the choice, adaptation, or devel- opment of a performance appraisal procedure.

As indicated in regard to job analyses procedures, there is also no clearly superior approach to conducting performance appraisals. There is a vast amount of research and theory around the issue, and depending on one's purpose, some of the research can be helpful in choosing an approach. As an illustration for this discussion of development issues, the use of a rating scale approach to performance appraisal will be used. Rating scales have proved to be generally useful in performance appraisal, and depending on the nature and use of the scale have also proved to be reliable. A study by Dawes indi- cated that while most rating scales are non-representational, with appropriate directions a rating scale could be used reliably to measure a representation variable, height.17 Furthermore, rating scales have both ordinal and interval properties.ls

The retranslation method has provided a useful approach to establishing rating scales with behavioral anchors.'" The accuracy of a rating scale format will, of course, vary with the nature of the job or performance being appraised.20 However, a variety of rating scale formats--Behavioral Expectation Scale (BES), Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS), and Behavioral Observation Scale (BOS)--is being used exten- hely and very appropriately in performance appraisal activity.

In 1963, Maurice Lorr, C. James Klett, and Douglas McNair made five specific

uggestions regarding the development of rating scales:

- 1. Only one variable should be rated at a time.

2.

Several items covering an aspect of behavior or a trait should be included in a rating scale.

- 3. Scales should allow the rater to describ: tne strength of a trait or behavior. Bipolar opposites are difficult to depend on for clear information.

4.

Items should use clear, non-jargon language as much as possible.

- 5. The span of the scale should reflect the range expected in th.: population to be appraised.21
