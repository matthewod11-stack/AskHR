werehighest when self-efficacy waslow. Kraimer etal. (2011) demonstrated that providing career mentoring facilitated perceptions of organizational support for development. Williams et al. (2009) found that leader–member exchange (LMX) and the amount of peer mentoring in a team influenced the amount of career mentoring the leader provided to team members. Team leader mentoring hada positiverelationship with informal learningthat occurredamongteam members. Mentoring research has also broadened from its traditional dyadic focus to examine the support provided by development networks, that is, a constellation of people from different life domains (Dobrow et al. 2012).

Supervisor support. Social support from supervisors has long been recognized as important for both learning and transfer of training. Research has incorporated the use of leadership theories including transformational leadership and LMX to further our understanding of the role of social support in informal learning and knowledge sharing (Ouweneel et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2011). Employeeswithhigh-qualityLMXrelationshipswiththeirsupervisorsengagedinmorevoluntary learning behaviors (Walumbwa et al. 2009) and perceived greater organizational support for development (Kraimer et al. 2011). Sluss & Thompson (2012) showed that the relationships between supervisory socialization tactics (i.e., supervisory job–focused advice, guidance, and role modeling), newcomer occupational identification, and perceived person–organization fit were mediated by perceptions of LMX.

Trust and fairness. Trust is a necessary condition for creating psychological safety and in turn enhancing learner engagement (Noe et al. 2010). In a study examining top management team member trust, Carmeli et al. (2012) found that trust was related to team learning from failures. Swift & Hwang (2013) found that affective trust was more important than cognitive trust in sharing interpersonal knowledge but that cognitive trust was more important in creating an organizational learning environment. Fairness and justice perceptions have been shown to be important in understanding organizational behavior but have received little research attention in the learning literature. In one of the few studies investigating justice perceptions in learning contexts, Zoogah (2010) found that they were related to intentions to participate in development activities but not to actual participation.
