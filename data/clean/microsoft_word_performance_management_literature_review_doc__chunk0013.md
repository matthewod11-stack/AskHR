There are many tensions within the multiple agendas and purposes of appraisals. Boswell and Boudreau (2000) make a most useful and clear distinction between two types of functions for appraisal systems:

(cid:1) Evaluative functions include use of performance appraisal for salary administration, promotion decisions, retention/termination decisions, recognition of individual performance and identification of poor performance. To conduct this evaluative function the appraiser takes the role of the ‘judge’. Evaluative functions focus primarily on differentiating between people.

(cid:1) Developmental functions include the identification of individual training

needs, providing performance feedback, determining transfers and attachments, identification of individual strengths and weaknesses. For this developmental function the appraiser takes the role of a coach or mentor. Developmental functions focus primarily on within person analysis.

A CIPD performance management survey showed that in the UK, while there has been a broadening in purpose and the linking of some of these different processes designed to impact on performance, the main purpose of the performance management process largely still revolves around personal objective setting and appraisal against objectives. This is included in the process in 90 per cent of cases (CIPD, 2005). Trends that have continued since the CIPD’s previous survey (in 1997) showed that there is an increasing focus on the development aspects of appraisal, and also devolvement of control and operation of the process from HR to line managers (CIPD, 2005).

Baron (2004) claims that the focus of performance management is on elements such as recognition, constructive feedback, personal development and career opportunities. However, there will always be an inevitable tension within career management which has to satisfy both the interests of the organisation and those
