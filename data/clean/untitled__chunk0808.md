# Evaluation

Even those later theorists who were to build on Galton’s work (e.g., Hunt, Frost, & Lunneborg, 1973) recognize that Galton was overly simplistic in his conception and measurement of intelligence. Galton was also pejorative toward groups whom he believed to be of inferior intelligence. Yet one could argue that Galton set at least three important precedents.

A ﬁrst precedent was the desirability of precise quantita- tive measurement. Much of psychological measurement, par- ticularly in the clinical areas, had been more qualitative, or has been based on dubious rules about translations of qualita- tive responses to quantitative measurements. Galton’s psy- chometric precision set a different course for research and practice in the ﬁeld of intelligence. His combination of theory and measurement techniques set a precedent: Many future in- vestigators would tie their theories, strong or weak, to mea- surement operations that would enable them to measure the intelligence of a variety of human populations.

A second precedent was the interface between theory and application. Galton’s Kensington Museum enterprise set a certain kind of tone for the intelligence measurement of the future. No ﬁeld of psychology, perhaps, has been more mar- ket oriented than has been the measurement of intelligence. Testing of intelligence has been highly inﬂuenced by market demands, more so, say, than testing of memory abilities or so- cial skills. It is difﬁcult to study the history of the ﬁeld of in- telligence without considering both theory and practice.

A third precedent was a tendency to conﬂate scores on tests of intelligence with some kind of personal value. Galton made no attempt to hide his admiration for hereditary ge- niuses (Galton, 1869) nor to hide his contempt for those at the lower end of the intelligence scale as he perceived it (Galton,
