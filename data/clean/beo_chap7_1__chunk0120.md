when the reference point is abstract (Alicke et al. 1995). Given the amount of noise

in stock prices, and the long horizon over which good and bad investments pay off

or fail, there is little clear feedback that would shake a CEQ’s overconfidence.

It is thus not surprising that experimental studies have found that executives are

particularly prone to display overconfidence, both in terms of the better-than-average

effect and in terms of underestimating risk (Larwood and Whittaker 1977; Moore

1977). Overconfidence, in the form of the better-than-average effect, also affects

the attribution of causality. Because individuals expect their behavior to produce

success, they are more likely to attribute good outcomes to their actions, but bad outcomes to (bad) luck.”3

But how important are such biases in real-world corporate decision-making? Roll

(1986) was one of the first to link overconfidence to mergers. He proposed a “hubris
