Most companies try to keep up with what their peers are offering, but some directors felt that benchmarking had created a “race to the top.”

Most companies try to keep up with what their peers are offering, but as one director told us, “Obviously, there is some balancing. If you want your CEO to stay, you’ll probably err on the side of paying more. But in a public company, we can’t go wildly off the rails because there’s enough data out there.” Another director commented, “You need to look at what other firms are doing with their incentive programs because that will set the expectations of your people. And if your people are being poached, you need to know what they’re being approached with.” Many others echoed the belief that the market determines executive compensation levels.

However, directors also argued that there are complex nuances to setting compensation. They pointed to challenges in finding suitable companies to use as benchmarks and in ensuring that that selection isn’t manipulated to achieve a certain outcome. The obstacles are even greater for smaller private companies, for which data is less available. Some directors also felt that benchmarking had created a “race to the top.” One commented, “The problem is that everyone always says, ‘We want to be just above the midpoint in this.’ And when everyone does that, then the midpoint keeps mov­ ing, right?” Other board members explained that deviations from benchmarks are often necessary to align executives with unique corporate strategies and organizational cultures.
