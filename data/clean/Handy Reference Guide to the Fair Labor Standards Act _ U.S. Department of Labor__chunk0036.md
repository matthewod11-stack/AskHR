# Who is Covered?

All employees of certain enterprises having workers engaged in interstate commerce, producing goods for interstate commerce, or

handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for such commerce by any person, are covered by the FLSA.

A covered enterprise is the related activities performed through unified operation or common control by any person or persons for a common business purpose and —

- 1. whose annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not less than $500,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail

level that are separately stated); or

- 2. is engaged in the operation of a hospital, an institution primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, or the mentally ill

who reside on the premises; a school for mentally or physically disabled or gi(cid:212)ed children; a preschool, an elementary or

secondary school, or an institution of higher education (whether operated for profit or not for profit); or

- 3. is an activity of a public agency.

Any enterprise that was covered by the FLSA on March 31, 1990, and that ceased to be covered because of the revised $500,000 test,

continues to be subject to the overtime pay, child labor and recordkeeping provisions of the FLSA.

Employees of firms which are not covered enterprises under the FLSA still may be subject to its minimum wage, overtime pay,

recordkeeping, and child labor provisions if they are individually engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce, or in any closely-related process or occupation directly essential to such production. Such employees include

those who: work in communications or transportation; regularly use the mails, telephones, or telegraph for interstate communication, or keep records of interstate transactions; handle, ship, or receive goods moving in interstate commerce; regularly

cross State lines in the course of employment; or work for independent employers who contract to do clerical, custodial, maintenance, or other work for firms engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce.

Domestic service workers such as day workers, housekeepers, chau(cid:211)eurs, cooks, or full-time babysitters are covered if:

- 1. their cash wages from one employer in calendar year 2010 are at least $1,700 (this calendar year threshold is adjusted by the

Social Security Administration each year); or

2. they work a total of more than 8 hours a week for one or more employers.
