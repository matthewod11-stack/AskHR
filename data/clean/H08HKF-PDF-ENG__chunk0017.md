# HBR / Digital Article / Designing a Responsible AI Program? Start with this Checklist

There is an important diﬀerence between metrics for the RAI program

itself and metrics for speciﬁc AI models or solutions. It is not just

the models themselves that need to be measured — the RAI program

itself must be tracked for the purposes of ensuring compliance and

improvement. Establishing metrics that track the rollout and impact of

the RAI program, as well as whether and how employees are complying

with it, is critical.

Metrics should measure the extent to which:

- Employees are aware of the RAI program, including the policies and

procedures that pertain to their role

- Each employee is abiding by the RAI program, including situations

in which an employee is either using the AI themselves or overseeing

someone else using AI

- The RAI program is producing the desired impacts • Eﬀorts at improving the RAI program are successful

Designing RAI metrics is as complex as it is important. Important high-

level decisions include:

- What is it worthwhile to measure, and what metrics will be used?

- Who is responsible for collecting and evaluating them?

- What is the frequency at which the metrics will be collected?

- What are the appropriate measurement targets, benchmarks, and
