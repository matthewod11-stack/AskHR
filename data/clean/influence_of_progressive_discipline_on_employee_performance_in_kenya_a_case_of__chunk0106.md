Richard, Valerie & Carol (2008) describes the findings of a pilot study which explored the impact and representation of employees within disciplinary and grievance processes. The research focused on eight case studies of employing organizations and was conducted in April and May 2008. The sample was made up of: two large private sector unionized organizations; two medium-sized non small non- unionized organizations; unionized organizations; and two large public sector organizations which both recognized trade unions. Case studies involved interviews with Human Resource managers, operational managers, trade union representatives and employee companions. It is important to note that the legislation did not compel workplaces to have a written procedure. It simply set out mandatory steps that had to be followed.
