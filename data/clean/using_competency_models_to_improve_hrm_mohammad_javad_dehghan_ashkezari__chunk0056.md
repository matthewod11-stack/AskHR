Today, performance is not only seen as "what" (objectives) an (competencies employee achieves but also viewed as "how" demonstrated) is carried out. Many organizations use competency-based models as a part of their employee development centers. The objective here is to assess individuals' strengths and weaknesses so that future development is identified. The competency, as a measurement tool, identifies behavioral factors relevant to performance in the job. The performance management process becomes stronger when employees are appraised on both objectives (what) and behavioral performance (how), referred to as the "mixed model". The "mixed model" provides a shared understanding of what will be monitored and measured, and ensures an understanding of how the work gets done in addition to what gets done (Ozcelik & Ferman,
