## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

motivate you to work harder, but often players see it as aﬃrmation

that they’re already working hard enough—if they weren’t, why would

the owner pay them $10 million a year? And because it’s a team sport,

an individual player can give 100% and the team still may be terrible,

which creates disincentives to keep trying so hard. The only hope of

breaking this cycle is for the people on the team to push one another to

do better.

I wish I had a foolproof method for going into any situation where a

player is giving 70% and ﬁnding a way to squeeze out that remaining

30%. I’m not sure I ever was able to do that. But by modeling team-

focused behavior and creating higher expectations and accountability,

I could reliably get another 5% or 10% out of players—and that often

made a big diﬀerence.

Sometimes the pacesetting wasn’t about working harder physically. It

was about communicating expectations more candidly. Because my

teammates knew that I was invested in them, I was able to oﬀer criticism

without making them feel attacked. “Hey, do you want me to lie to you

and tell you what you want to hear?” I’d say. “Or do you want me to tell

you the truth? You were not prepared today, so you weren’t at your best.

We need you to be better.” As a society, we’ve moved away from having

those frank conversations. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to recognize

that when people give me tough love and tell me the truth, it’s often the

best sign that they really care about me.

Recognize teammates’ individual psychology and the best ways to

motivate them. Every NFL player is unique. Some are motivated

by money and contracts. Some are motivated by recognition, like

making the All-Pro team. Some are motivated by what the media is

writing about them. Some are motivated by winning championships,

while others are just trying to avoid losing their job. Great leaders
