The bank has made tremendous effort to inculcate the coaching culture in the

organization. The bank has embarked on the training of line managers to equip them

with appropriate coaching skills. Coaching is now regarded as a core competency

among the managers. The staff at all levels have been implored to embrace coaching

as means to manage the staff performance. As coaching continues its evolution in

the bank, there appears to be a trend from managers being coached to managers

being coaches.

The bank has a Leadership and Management Centre has is tasked with providing

training for the employees. The skills learned from T&D compliments the coaching

efforts this accelerating both employee and organizational performance. The

employees are also encouraged to further their studies and also undertake

professional certifications to augment their skills and improve their performance.

Lack of time for employeeâ€™s participation, Questionable expertise of coaches,

Unwillingness of employees to engage in the coaching process are some of the

barriers associated with coaching. However, the bank has made efforts to mitigate

these challenges through education on the importance of coaching, allocating time

and number of coaching sessions to be done.
