## HBR / Magazine Article / How to Identify the Perfect Cofounder

For those considering a cofounder who is your spouse, a family member,

or a close friend, be aware that launching a business together will

catapult your relationship to a whole new level—fast. This can be

an incredibly rewarding experience, but it can also test a personal

relationship to the max. While you are likely to trust each other more

than strangers, you may have baggage that creates a lot of emotion

and triggers around certain issues. I’ve seen cofounding teams made

up of spouses, relatives, or friends be very successful, but I’ve also

seen teams erode irreparably because of events rooted in their personal history. It’s very diﬃcult to separate personal issues from your business,

so don’t make this choice lightly. Consider getting a coach early on

who specializes in working with cofounders with a preexisting personal

relationship. Personal tensions will arise, and having support to work

through them will be crucial to your long-term success.
