## without a partner with particular domain expertise, the venture will

not be able to progress. Sometimes investors will require an unequal

split—say, 49% and 51%—to avoid future stalemates at critical decision

points. An online equity calculator can help you come up with some

numbers, but consider your particular relationship carefully before

following what a calculator or your investors tell you to do.

Meet each other’s partners, families, and friends. Not only does

this reveal the broader context of each individual’s character, but it

also helps the important people in your life understand this new

relationship and thus avoid resentment. So when you are up until 2 AM

messaging your cofounder about a pitch or how to deal with a customer

issue, your spouse or partner is likely to be more understanding.
