## immigrant leadership talent in comparison with the overall population of

business leaders. But given the disadvantage immigrants and ethnic

minorities still face in the labor market, we expect ethnic and immigrant

leaders to be high performers. This is important as research has shown

that organizations with the highest quality leaders were 13 times more

likely to outperform their competition in key competitive metrics

including ﬁnancial performance, quality of products and services,

employee engagement, and customer satisfaction. The U.S. has

traditionally had an advantage attracting immigrant talent from Europe

and elsewhere. Yet, stricter U.S. immigration policy can mean that other

governments will ﬁnd it easier to attract leadership talent that might

otherwise end up in America. However, with the anti-foreign worker

Brexit discourse in the UK, it is Canada that appears particularly well

suited to gain an advantage in the competition for leadership talent. If the

U.S. hopes to address its leadership shortage as its population ages, it

needs to embrace immigration, and acknowledge the signiﬁcant

contribution that immigrant executives already play.
