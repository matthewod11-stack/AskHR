# Reducing Workplace Violence

Acts of workplace violence cannot completely be eliminated, but they can be reduced through security measures, employee screening, and management awareness (Epstein, ).

Security Measures Increased security measures can decrease the probability of workplace violence. These measures can include such physical changes as adding surveillance cam- eras, silent alarms, bright external lighting, bulletproof barriers, sophisticated lock systems, and security guards; making high-risk areas more visible; and using drop safes and posting signs stating that only limited cash is kept on the prem- ises. Staffing changes can include increasing the number of staff on duty; clos- ing during the higher-risk late night and wee hours of the morning; and training employees in how to deal with robberies, conflicts, and angry customers.

Employee Screening Though the security measures mentioned here are aimed primarily at reducing workplace violence resulting from other crimes such as robbery, they can also aid in reducing violence caused by current and former employees. Another method of reducing violence committed by current and former employees is to use psy- chological tests, reference checks, and background checks to screen applicants for violence potential.

Background and reference checks can provide information about an appli- cant’s history of violence. These checks are important because employees who engage in workplace violence are chronically disgruntled, have a history of caus- ing trouble, and frequently change jobs. Dietz () provides two interesting

examples. An applicant at a California maintenance company was hired in spite of a history of domestic violence and burglary convictions. He later set fire to a bookkeeper who wouldn’t give him his paycheck. Another organization was sued because an employee who had killed a coworker was rehired by the same com- pany in an effort to employ ex-cons. After a short period on the job, the employee killed another coworker.

It is important to note that ex-cons cannot categorically be denied employ- ment. An organization must take into account the length of time that has passed since the crime was committed, the seriousness of the crime, and the relevance of the crime to the job in question.

Psychological tests such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-) and a variety of integrity tests discussed in Chapter  can potentially predict violence in people without a history of violence. However, an empirical link between scores on these tests and workplace violence has yet to be made (Tonowski, ), in part because the violent event being predicted usually occurs many years after the preemployment testing. Furthermore, incidents of workplace violence are an interaction between a high-risk employee, an organization with poor management for which the employee works, and a stressful event attributed by the employee to the organization (Habeeb & Prencipe, ). Thus, a high- risk employee will be violent only under certain circumstances, which constantly change and are difficult to measure. Testing for high-risk employees is made even more difficult because the Americans with Disabilities Act provides limitations to the use of tests designed to determine psychological problems.

Management Awareness Workplace violence can be greatly reduced by making managers aware of high- risk situations and empowering them to take immediate action. Most experts on workplace violence (e.g., Randazzo, ) believe that berserkers—employees who “go crazy” and shoot people—give indications that they are going to com- mit future violence. Such indications include threats, acts of violence, comments about wanting to get even, excessive talk of guns, and comments about famous serial killers and mass murderers. In one survey, % of HR practitioners who had incidents of workplace violence in their organizations observed warning signs prior to the incident (Trenn, ).

Take, for example, Thomas McIlvane, a fired postal worker who shot eight for- mer coworkers, killing four. Prior to a union hearing appealing his termination, he stated that if he lost his grievance he would make a shooting incident in Oklahoma that took the lives of  postal workers “look like a tea party.” As another example, prior to being fired and then killing his supervisors, Larry Hansel was reprimanded for excessively talking about a postal worker who killed two coworkers in Escon- dido, California (Graham, ). Jennifer Sanmarco, who killed five postal workers in California in January  before taking her own life, had already been placed on medical leave because of her clearly unstable behavior at the postal facility.

Cavanaugh () advises “zero tolerance” for threats and violence. That is, one act and the employee is terminated (fired, not killed). Dietz () suggests that anyone who makes others feel uncomfortable is potential trouble. Turner and Gelles () suggest that employees whose behavior makes others feel scared should be screened for violence potential. This screening includes inter- views with coworkers and supervisors as well as meetings with a clinical psychol- ogist. From these interviews and meetings, Turner and his associates place the employee into one of five risk categories:
