# Halo

This error occurs when the evaluator forms a general, overall impression of the employee's performance, then fills out the rating form to reflect this impression. This practice should be avoided. Instead, the rater should consider each item on the scale individually and should try not to let his/her rating of the employee on one item influence the rating on another item.

Logical This error, similar to the halo error, occurs when the evaluator, in an attempt to appear consis- tent, bases his/her rating on "logic" rather than on observation, thus allowing his/her response to one scale item to unjustly influence the response to another. As stated above, each item on the scale should be considered individually. An empiv,,PP's level of performance will typically not be perfectly consistent (from item to item), thus there is no requirement that the rating of the employee be somehow logically consistent. What is important is that the ratings reflect only the employee's actual level of performance on each item.

Proximity This error, similar to the two above, occurs when the supervisor allows his/her rating on one item 3f the scale to influence the rating on a second item simply because the two items are located close to one another on the scale. Again, each item should be considered independently.

Contrast and Comparison These errors occur when the supervisor rates his/her employees not accord- ing to the standards specified on the scale, but in contrast or comparison to some other kind of standard, such as the performance of the best or worst employee the supervisor has ever known, the level of performance the supervisor thinks he/she could attain if he/she were doing the job, etc. Each employee should be evaluated independently according to the standards specified on the rating scale, not in comparison with other employees, ideals, etc.
