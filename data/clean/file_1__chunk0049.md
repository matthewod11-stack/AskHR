In 2004, the Non-Discrimination Act translated relevant EU directives on equal treatment into the Finnish national law (21/2004). It banned gender and other discriminations as well as sexual harassment. The Act on Equality was revised and improved in 2005 (232/2005). According to the revised Act, employers with thirty or more employees have to have an equality plan that includes a report on how women and men are distributed in different duties and on salary differentials by gender. Those employers who do not produce the equality plan can get a fine.

Nowadays, women are strongly represented in Finnish politics and trade unions; they gain higher levels of education than men. High gender segregation of the Finnish labour market is combined with high female full-time employment rates. From an international perspective, Finland is characterized by high degree of reconciliation of work and family life (Husu, 2001). As depicted in Figure 1, although no country in the world has reached full gender equality, Finland occupied third place after Iceland and Norway in the 2010 Global Gender Gap Index. It contains four sub-indexes: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment (Global Gender Gap Report, 2010).
