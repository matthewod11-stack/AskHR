While the evidence is reassuring for organisations considering using 3608 feedback, there are a number of important issues that need to be considered to enable an organisation to adopt multi-rater feedback effectively, including: . The focus of the 3608 feedback process must be clear to all employees who are part of the feedback system Â± the developmental nature of the programme must be clearly communicated and understood.

. Clear guidance must be given to the

recipients regarding what they should do with the feedback. This will usually require the organisation to put in place some form of development planning and career management processes to enable recipients to translate the feedback into appropriate development and career plans.

. Raters must be afforded the opportunity to observe the various behaviours that are being rated; raters should be able to accurately perceive and interpret the salient aspects of the ratee's performance; and raters have to perceive the need to improve the effectiveness of the behaviour that is being assessed.
