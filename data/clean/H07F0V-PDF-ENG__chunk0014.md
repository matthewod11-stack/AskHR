## phrases. Ellen Galinsky, president and founder of the Families and

Work Institute in New York, warns that children might hear “I got ﬁred”

and think of guns. She also points out that “laid oﬀ” doesn’t hold any

meaning for most little kids.

Older kids, however, have a more nuanced understanding of the

implications of job loss. And don’t be surprised if they have a lot of

follow-up questions about how they will be impacted. At the same time,

realize it might take a while for their questions to come out. Reassure

them their questions are welcome at any time.
