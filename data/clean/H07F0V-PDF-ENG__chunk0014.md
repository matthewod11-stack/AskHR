# Be Authentic

Your instinct might be to conceal what you’re feeling in an eﬀort to

protect the kids, but it’s actually healthy for them to talk about real

emotions. As clinical psychologist Dr. Julie Futrell explains, they know

if what you’re telling them doesn’t match the emotions they are sensing.

When parents model honest emotions, kids have an opportunity to see

mom and dad as human and to witness resiliency and healthy coping

mechanisms. You should share what you’re feeling, why, and how you

are managing those feelings. So you might say, “Daddy feels really sad

today. And it’s ok to feel sad. But I’m going to be alright and will do what

it takes to get back to feeling happy.”
