remain heavily involved in maintaining and developing our culture and

commitment to it. Retail is hard if you’re not located in the right spot,

so we advise on the areas that can work best. We also don’t currently

have drive-throughs, because we’re not selling just coﬀee—we’re selling

an experience. All the shops use our signature signage, drink machines,

and unique accommodations, such as giving customers playing cards

that match up with their orders rather than writing their names on the cups (which can be diﬃcult for some of our team members). It’s critical

to us to ensure that each Bitty & Beau’s maintains the quality drinks

and food, excellent service, and communal environment we’ve become

known for. After all, our kids’ names are on the sign.
