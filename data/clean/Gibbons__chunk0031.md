### **[The cultivation imperative]{.underline}**

[The shift from HR to human cultivation isn\'t semantic --- it\'s
fundamental. Cultivation implies growth, patience, and creating
conditions for flourishing. It recognizes that humans aren\'t resources
to be optimized but potential to be developed.]{.underline}

[In practical terms, this means helping humans discover capabilities
they didn\'t know they had. When AI handles routine cognitive work, what
dormant human capacities can emerge? When efficiency is automated, what
new forms of creativity become possible? When AI provides infinite
answers, what questions will humans learn to ask?]{.underline}

[Your role is to create environments where humans can explore these
questions safely. This requires psychological safety at a new level ---
not just safety to fail, but safety to fundamentally reimagine one\'s
professional identity. It requires learning approaches that are
experimental rather than prescribed. It requires patience with the
messiness of human transformation.]{.underline}
