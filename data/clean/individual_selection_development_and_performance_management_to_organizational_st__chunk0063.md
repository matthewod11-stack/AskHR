# Future Directions

OPM was created to ensure that a merit sys- tem of hiring and promotion is maintained in the federal government. Recent and future work adds to this mission by supporting the basic elements of a merit system, as well as promoting the selection of individuals with the optimal combination of competencies for per- formance within an occupation and for the best fit with the organization. The results of the MOSAIC studies have provided the foun- dation for OPMâ€™s policy initiatives as well as for integrated HR tools for managers, employ- ees, and applicants. This foundation of occu- pational information is essential for HR to be value-added in the twenty-first century by as- sisting organizations in moving forward and responding quickly to their changing needs.
