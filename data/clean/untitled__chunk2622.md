# SCHOLARSHIP

Ratcliff (1997) labeled a second curricular model as analyti- cal. Variables in the curriculum that affect student develop- ment are identiﬁed, measured, and evaluated to determine their effectiveness. McGovern (1993) described an analytical model for psychology as:

What kind of outcomes can be achieved with What kind of students taught by What kind of faculty using What kind of teaching methods as part of What kind of curriculum? (p. 218, emphases in original)

In this section on scholarship, we ﬁrst focus on faculty efforts to identify common outcomes from the earliest days of a

single course to the contemporary “Top 30” described by Perlman and McCann (1999a). Second, we focus on the as- sessment of these outcomes by the faculty, but more often mandated by external constituencies in the interests of ac- creditation or public accountability.
