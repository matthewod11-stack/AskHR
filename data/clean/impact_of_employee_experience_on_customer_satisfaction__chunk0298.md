# Fig. 42 Difference between regions

Economic parameters linked into research

Analysis of economic parameters of the studied company are not the subject of this

document and it represents a consolidated view of three different regions. Limited

availability of raw data of Net Promoter scores by region for respected years led to

the author’s subjective point of view of the business implication of Employee

Experience and NPS. Further statistical analysis was not possible to execute. The

attached table contains selected economic parameters taken from the researched

time period and represents all three regions. Economic results are heavily impacted

by the global economic situation influenced by covid-19, war in Ukraine, and the global

supply chain crisis. Based on table 12 – economic parameters of the studied

company, Atlas Copco company revenue reached pre-covid figures by 2021, however

significant improvements in efficiency in terms of functional cost development led to

better profitability compared to 2018 or 2019. A high statistical difference is visible in

Employee Experience where all aspects of EX have had significant improvement

when compared with the years 2017 or 2019. Net Promoter Score, which is the

customer satisfaction index, also significantly improved compared to previous years

whereas 2017 NPS = 16.15 and NPS in the author’s survey reached a score of 20.
