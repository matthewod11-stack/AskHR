in detail. However, managers frequently misinterpret how the ﬁndings

of those and other studies apply to their own business situation. When

making decisions, managers should consider internal validity—whether

an analysis accurately answers a question in the context in which it

was studied. They should also consider external validity—the extent to

which they can generalize results from one context to another. That will

help them avoid making ﬁve common mistakes:

Conﬂating causation with correlation. Even though most people know

that correlation doesn’t equal causation, this error is surprisingly

prevalent. Take eBay’s advertising strategy. For years the company

had advertised on search engines such as Google, looking to grow

demand by attracting more customers. A consulting report concluded

that the ads were eﬀective, noting that when more ads were shown in
