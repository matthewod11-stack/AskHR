## HBR / Magazine Article / Hybrid Still Isn’t Working

. . .

Employees today see remote work practices as the new normal, and

resistance to the changes we have recommended may be great. A crucial

ﬁrst step in overcoming it is making the case that new policies are

necessary: “A lack of cooperation among employees is causing the

following performance problems, and we have to ﬁx them.” Then it

falls to leaders to institute new rules and practices—and enforce them. Fully remote companies oﬀer a road map, but for most companies the

administrative burden will be onerous for supervisors and managers,

who are increasingly squeezed by other demands. Ultimately, many organizations will ﬁnd that it is easier and more eﬀective to bring

everyone back to the oﬃce—but those that can’t accommodate their

workforce on-site or are reluctant to do so will have to manage diﬀerently. For these organizations, redesigning how hybrid work

functions is the only way forward.
