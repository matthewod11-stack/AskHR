## one of the oldest companies in the United States, the Philadelphia

Contributionship, a home-insurance company that was founded by Ben

Franklin in 1752. Cooperatives and mutual companies (like State Farm

and Northwestern Mutual) can align the interests of the executives and

customers, allowing for a value-driven approach to decision-making.

However, the number of sectors where ownership by customers is

practical is relatively small. Businesses owned by customers can also

struggle to get capital and stagnate because of lower ﬁnancial pressure

to perform.
