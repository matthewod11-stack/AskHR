# Processes of management.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

“Obsessive maverick” is my preferred phrase for a geek. And the

obsessive mavericks that I got really interested in were the ones who

dove in, again, on this problem of, “How do we run a company and

keep doing well in our markets and avoid the dysfunctions that seem to

plague so many successful companies as they get older and bigger? How

do we avoid those dysfunctions? How do we do something that’s higher

performing, more sustainable, and a better place to work?”
