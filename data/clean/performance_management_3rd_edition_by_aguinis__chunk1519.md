## Taking Coaching Seriously at Becton, Dickinson, and Company

A coaching culture and leadership development are viewed as competitive strengths at Becton, Dickinson, and Company (BD, http://www.bd.com). The U.S.-based company manufactures and sells medical supplies, devices, laboratory instruments, antibodies, reagents, and diagnostic products to health-care organizations, clinical laboratories, private industry, and the public. The coaching culture at BD includes the following points, as noted by Joseph Toto, the company’s director of leadership development and learning:

- 1. We place high expectations on corporate leaders to model coaching as a productive and effective way to improve performance.

- 2. We expect leaders at all management levels to be coached as well as to coach the develop- ment of others.

- 3. We establish coaching as a norm. Leaders must view coaching and development as some of the key responsibilities and deliverables in their roles.

Part of the company’s training program includes developing skills through peer coaching and building management skills through peer interaction, support, and guidance. The training sessions emphasize several skills, including listening, asking facilitating and open-ended questions, sharing experiences, and challenging assumptions or discussing actions that might not be productive in the view of the coach. Training also involves self-assessment of strengths and weaknesses and identifying behaviors that would assist leaders in any given circumstance in which they might find themselves as managers in the company. In summary, BD has utilized training programs to develop and reinforce a coaching culture. This culture is credited with developing leaders to provide direction to others in a constantly changing business environment.12
