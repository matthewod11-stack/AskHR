# Latent mean comparison

Comparing group differences is a central analysis in HRD (Keiffer & Lane, 2016) and social sciences generally (Müller & Schäfer, 2017). Researchers typically use t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to estimate between-group differences (Müller & Schäfer, 2017). For example, when estimating the difference in workplace coaching skill between male and female supervisors, Hsieh and Huang (2018) estimating the summed average of a 20-item latent measure, and then conducted a t-test. However, compared with summed average approaches (i.e. t-test and ANOVA), structured means modelling (i.e. latent mean comparison) is more robust because it accounts for measurement error, enhances statistical power, and predicts more precise results (Müller & Schäfer, 2017). HRD researchers have previously been encouraged to adopt more advanced statistical methods (Keiffer & Lane, 2016). Since the four outcome variables in this study were modelled as
