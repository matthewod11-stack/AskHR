## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 261

we see cross-national differences in outcomes? A more detailed understanding of PCO's termination process is important in order to answer the question.

- 1. PCO's Rapid Termination Procedure

In both the United States and Canada, PCO has a two-tiered termination policy. A ``rapid termination'' occurs when an employee commits one of PCO's ``five deadly sins'' ± absence of three days without notice, dishonesty, insubordination, possession of firearms or violation of the substance abuse policy, and misconduct.8 In those cases, the termination process is not drawn out over many months, but occurs virtually ``on the spot.'' The human resources department is consulted only briefly and provided verification that the incident was sufficient to merit termination and to ensure that PCO has the evidence to prove the violation. Not only does rapid termination eliminate the presence of the problem employee, but it also provides an example to other employees that certain behavior will simply not be tolerated by PCO. In a typical year, PCO Canada and PCO U.S. the same percentage of employees using rapid termination ± about 1 percent. There is little cross-national difference in rapid termination and the law in both countries allows it in these sorts of circumstances.
