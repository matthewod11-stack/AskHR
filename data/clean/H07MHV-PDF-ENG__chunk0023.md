## psychologist Anita Williams Woolley and her colleagues at Harvard and

Stanford undertook a study in which they asked object visualizers and

spatial visualizers to navigate a Pac Man–style virtual maze. Some of the

teams were pairs of same-style thinkers, others were diﬀerent thinkers.

The research found that the teams of mixed thinkers outperformed the

homogenous teams. When the teams were mixed, the visual spatial

thinkers tended to work the joystick and the object visualizer zapped

the greebles. The homogenous groups tended to spend more time in

conversations that didn’t lead to results. (If you have been in one of

those endless company meetings where nothing gets resolved, this may

ring familiar.) It turns out that great minds that do not think alike are

more likely to yield towering innovations.
