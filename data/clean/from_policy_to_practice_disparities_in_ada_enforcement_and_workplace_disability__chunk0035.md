California and Massachusetts are convincing examples of how intertwined levels of legislation, institutional ability, and corporate responsibility result in proactive and sustainable ADA compliance ecosystems. 4.3 Low-Compliance States: Gaps and Limitations Mississippi Mississippi has a compliance score of 50, making it hard to enforce ADA and making worksites more accessible (Miller, 2024).

- (cid:32) Legal: Mississippi has no disability discrimination laws that complement the ADA; all people have to do is depend on federal mechanisms entirely. Inadequate Advocacy: There is a lack of disability rights groups and legal representation services, which makes workers unable to claim at all.

- (cid:32)

- (cid:32) Economic Structure: With the economy being largely characterized by the farms and manual labor sector, employers in Mississippi are usually not equipped or trained in accommodating disability. Alabama A score of 52 on the compliance index indicates that Alabama has systemic and culture-related obstacles to the ADA implementation (Parra, 2023).

- (cid:32) Enforcement Weakness: There is no state equivalent of the EEOC, and federally based offices are understaffed, which causes sluggishness and backlog in the procedures.

- (cid:32) Cultural Issues: Attitudinal barrier towards disability is still deeply rooted, which lowers the motivation of employees to seek accommodations.

- (cid:32) Unavailability of Expertise in Legal Help: Disability law is not an area of specialty among most attorneys, and this deters legal action. The example of Mississippi and Alabama proves that the resulting effect of such institutional negligence, unsatisfactory policy frameworks, and social impediments has an effect. The existence of these states is used to highlight how important it is to have a strong local form of structures to help in sustaining the federal prescriptions. 4.4 Geographic and Political Factors Influencing ADA Enforcement The difference in the ADA enforcement varies by state is more of a legal issue which goes hand in hand with geography, political stance, and the economic infrastructure (Parra, 2023).

- (cid:32) Political Affiliations: In general, states with a Democratic leaning develop stronger ADA structure and enforcement. They are also inclined to enact additional laws by states and subsidize accessibility audits and training of the population. States having Republican dominance tend to emphasise business freedom, at times above regulatory oversight.

- (cid:32) Economic Investment: Higher GDP and more urbanized economies invest in the time-tested services that people need or want, such as ADA enforcement. As an illustration, New York and California have a wide net of compliance officers and training programs.
