# CONCLUSION

Physiological psychology, the ﬁeld concerned with biologi- cal substrates of behavior and experience (mind), has to be the most important discipline in psychology and the life sci- ences. The two great questions in science are the nature of the universe and the nature of the mind. Over the past century, the ﬁeld of physiological psychology has spun off a number of areas that are now separate ﬁelds in their own right: vision, audition, psychophysiology, behavioral genetics, behavioral neuroscience, and cognitive neuroscience. It seems that in this sense physiological psychology is destined to self- destruct. But to participate in the process is surely among the most exciting intellectual endeavors of our time.
