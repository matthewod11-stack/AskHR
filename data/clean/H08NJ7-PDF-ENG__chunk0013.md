## a deep review of academic literature on the subject.

The framework is based on the concepts of “push” and “pull” that

are widely used in the ﬁeld of sports to develop an athlete’s skills and

performance. The push coaching method refers to an approach where

the coach provides clear instructions, guidance, and feedback. This

style is more hands-on and involves telling athletes what to do and how

to do it. Pull coaching adopts a facilitative approach, aiming to guide

and support rather than provide direct instruction. This style relies on

asking open-ended questions to encourage self-reﬂection so athletes

can discover solutions on their own.
