# Relatively Unstructured Formats

More than most persons using interviews for evaluative pur- poses, psychologists and other mental health professionals have traditionally favored relatively unstructured interview- ing methods. The popularity of unstructured inquiry can be credited to the inﬂuence of two of the most signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the history of psychotherapy, Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) and Carl Rogers (1902–1987). Freud (1913/1958) recom- mended a free association method for conducting psychoan- alytic treatment sessions that consists of instructing people to report whatever thoughts or feelings come to mind. Rogers (1942, 1951) proposed a nondirective method for conducting client-centered therapy in which the therapist’s interventions consist mainly of reﬂecting clients’ statements back to them. Although based on markedly different ways of conceptualiz- ing human behavior and the psychotherapeutic process, free association and nondirective methods share in common an open-ended approach that provides minimal guidance to people concerning what or how much they should say.
