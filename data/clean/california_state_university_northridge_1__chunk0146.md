# problems.

During the authors time with Marriott, they were in the process of renovation all

of their business units within the airport. The renovation involved closing an existing

business unit( s) and establishing a temporary shop until the new business had been built

from the grmu1d up. A demolition teaiTi would come and tear down the current facility

and a new crew would then start building a new unit. Since the temporary facility only

51

required about a quarter of the employees, this was a time for those who had constant

problems to be terminated in accordance with the union contract stipulations. The only

notice give was a layoff notice, which in some case may have been pushed back based on

the contractor. Employees were transferred based on seniority as delineated within the

contract. No managers were laid off, only went for additional training or assisted with

another business unit. At this time there was nothing the union representative could do for

the workers. Quality workers were retained, along with those with seniority however,

they had to meet the needs and expectation of each new business unit.

The only apparent downfall to the terms and agreement of the contract lied with

management and the ability to comply with the terms and conditions. If one manager who

complies with the contract for all employees writes up an employee and another manager

is relaxed about such contractual obligations and disciplinary action with the employees,

this can cause problems. Inconsistency is the major flaw that is currently being addressed

by ongoing training, which stresses documentation.
