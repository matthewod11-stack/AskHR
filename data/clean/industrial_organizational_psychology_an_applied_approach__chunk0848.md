# Consequences of Aﬃ rmative Action Plans

Though affirmative action programs are an important tool in ensuring equal opportunity, they can result in some negative consequences for people hired or promoted as the result of affirmative action (Kravitz et al., ). Research indicates that employees hired due to affirmative action programs are perceived by coworkers as less competent (Heilman, Block, & Lucas, ; Heilman, Block, & Stathatos, ), have a tendency to devalue their own performance (Heilman & Alcott, ; Heilman, Lucas, & Kaplow, ), and behave negatively toward oth- ers who are hired based on affirmative action programs (Heilman, Kaplow, Amato, & Stathatos, ). These effects can be reduced when applicants are given posi- tive information about their abilities (Heilman et al, ; Kravitz et al., ). Not surprisingly, women and ethnic minorities hold more positive views toward affir- mative action than do males and nonminorities (Kravitz & Platania, ).

The Heilman and Kravitz studies suggest that affirmative action programs can have negative consequences for their recipients. Affirmative action programs may also have negative consequences for an organization. Silva and Jacobs () found that hiring minorities above their level of representation in the applicant pool (affirmative action) resulted in decreased organizational performance. With all of these studies in mind, it is essential that an organization weigh the many ben- efits of affirmative action programs against the programs’ unintended side effects.

As discussed previously in the chapter, an employment practice is illegal if it results in adverse impact and is not job related. An employment practice can also be illegal if it unnecessarily violates an individual’s right to privacy.

is in the area of drug testing and locker searches. Several courts have ruled that drug testing is considered a “search” and that therefore, to be legal in the public sector, drug testing programs must be reasonable and with cause. It is important to understand that the Fourth Amendment is limited to public agencies such as state and local governments. Private industry is not restricted from drug testing by the Fourth Amendment unless government regulations require drug testing (for example, for trucking companies and railroads), but drug testing and searches by a private organization must be conducted in “good faith and with fair dealing.”

Generally, employers are free (even encouraged by the government) to test job applicants for current drug use. In fact, the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act requires employers with federal contracts of $, or more to maintain a drug-free workplace. Furthermore, such states as Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, and Georgia provide discounts on workers’ compensation rates to employers with a drug-free workplace program (Steingold, ).
