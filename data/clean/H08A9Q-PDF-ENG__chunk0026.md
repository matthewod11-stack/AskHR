of classic “outsourcing,” these capabilities were highly integrated into

the end-to-end processes that the company owned. In this way, the

company was able to access subject-matter specialists who excelled in

speciﬁc areas, and it could leverage the technology investments those

specialists had already made.

- 3. Stand up a “digital factory” to reimagine end-to-end processes.

Just like manufacturers have factories for product assembly, we

recommend companies create a “digital factory” — a team staﬀed with

capabilities such as product strategy, product design, data engineering,

data science, and automation — to help bring to life their reimagined

processes. By applying these methods consistently across each process

area, this team can develop tools, training, and a governance model

that can help the company prevent years of business process debt. For

example, a digital factory can stitch together emerging technologies

(AI, machine learning, and intelligent automation) with other tools,

such as ServiceNow, Salesforce, and SAP, to replace or augment existing
