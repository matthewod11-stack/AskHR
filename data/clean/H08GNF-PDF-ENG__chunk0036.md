## “analytical thinking,” “strong collaboration skills,” “technical expertise

in developing and optimizing algorithms,” or “ability to meet project

deadlines.” Here’s an example of a response:

Situation: Our team was facing a critical performance issue with

a complex algorithm in our new app and the launch deadline was

approaching fast.

Task: I had to ﬁgure out how to optimize the algorithm to improve

the app’s performance and ensure it was ready for release.

Action: I ﬁrst consulted with the team to understand the analysis

which was completed on the current algorithm. Together, we

whiteboarded and broke down the problem into smaller components

to visualize the underlying logic of the code. I then used proﬁling

tools to identify speciﬁc parts of the algorithm that consumed the

most resources. I experimented with different data structures and

replaced the inefficient ones, such as arrays, with more suitable

ones like hash maps or balance trees. I implemented techniques

like memorization and dynamic programming to optimize and

speed up the algorithm. Finally, I cleaned up the code and

removed unnecessary complexities to improve readability and
