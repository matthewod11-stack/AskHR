# requirements, organizational advocacy and governmental relations, literary content, and practice.

Some of the external and internal regulation was in re- sponse to the changing structure of U.S. society. Increased immigration contributed to a more culturally diverse school population. School psychologists were particularly involved in programs of bilingual education, the teaching of tolerance, and especially the development of nondiscriminatory assess- ment practices. Maternal employment out of the home and the rapid rise of single-parent families, largely as a result of divorce, also had an impact on schooling and psychological services. These were related to concerns for “latchkey” and “at-risk” children that necessitated school psychological ser- vices along lines of intervention and consultation (see later discussion of practice).

Finally, the practitioner workforce was also growing in cultural diversity, but by the turn of the twenty-ﬁrst century it was still predominantly Caucasian. Efforts to improve minor- ity representation have been moderately successful. Women were always well represented in school psychology, perhaps always at least 30% of practitioners. Many held high-ranking administrative positions in school districts and directed de- partments of psychological services. Female representation in the ﬁeld increased rapidly after the 1960s and was more than 70% by the late 1990s. In the Thoroughbred Years, women quickly acquired positions of leadership in the NASP, the APA, and state associations, as well as editorships and training program faculty positions.
