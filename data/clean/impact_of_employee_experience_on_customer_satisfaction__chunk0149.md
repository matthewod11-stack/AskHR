## 2.6.2.1. Employee Net Promoter Scores (eNPS)

Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is measurement how likely employees are to

recommend the organization as good place to work. It is usually built into the

Employee Engagement survey because a single question is insufficient to reveal all

the aspects of employee needs and feelings. eNPS contains only one simple

question: How likely are you to recommend your company as a place to work?

Measurement is on a scale of 0-10. eNPS has roots in traditional customer satisfaction

survey NPS which companies asking their companies “how likely they will recommend

product or services to their family or friends”.

Calculating eNPS

eNPS responses on satisfaction scale 0-10 are divide into three categories:

▪ 9 – 10 – Promoters: these are the most satisfied, happy, and motivated employees

▪ 7 – 08 – Passives: employees who are satisfied but not passionate

▪ 0 – 6 – Detractors: dissatisfied employees, bad relationship, they would not

recommend the company

eNPS does not take Passives into consideration, so we get the eNPS score from

subtracting the percentage of Detractors from percentage of Promoters.
