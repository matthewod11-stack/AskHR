Understanding 36088 feedback

Defining 36088 feedback

There are numerous authors who propose definitions of the 3608 feedback process. ``Feedback from multiple sources or `3608 feedback' is a performance appraisal approach that relies on the input of an employee's superiors, colleagues, subordinates, sometimes customers, suppliers and/or spouses'' (Yukl and Lepsinger, 1995, p. 45). In a special edition of Human Resource Management on 3608 feedback, Tornow (1993) observes that in 3608 feedback programmes, feedback about a target individual is solicited from significant others using a standardised instrument. Jones and Bearley (1996) refer to 3608 feedback as the practice of gathering and processing multi-rater assessments on individuals and feeding back the results to the recipients. Hoffman (1995, p. 82) explains that 3608 feedback is:

... an approach that gathers behavioural observations from many layers within the organisation and includes self-assessment.

He points out that the feedback recipient completes the same structured evaluation process that managers, direct reports, team members and sometimes external clients use to evaluate his/her performance. Lepsinger and Lucia (1997) indicate that the 3608 feedback process involves collecting perceptions about a person's behaviour and the impact of that behaviour from a number of rating sources. Therefore, a 3608 feedback programme seeks to relay feedback to the recipient regarding his/her behaviour in the workplace and how it affects other organisational members that work with that employee.

Yukl and Lepsinger (1995) suggest that 3608 feedback is a performance appraisal method; Jones and Bearley (1996) refer to assessments in their definition; Tornow (1993) suggests that feedback is solicited from significant others using a standardised instrument. Hoffman (1995) mentions behavioural

observations of the ratee and Lepsinger and Lucia (1997) mention perceptions. 3608 appraisal extends feedback input from the traditional top-down approach to include subordinates, peers, customers and can be viewed as ``boundaryless appraisal''. In an era where the boundaryless organisation is gaining increasing currency (see, for example, Ashkenas et al., 1995), the concept of 3608 feedback seems to fit very well with the tenets of this approach to organisational theory.
