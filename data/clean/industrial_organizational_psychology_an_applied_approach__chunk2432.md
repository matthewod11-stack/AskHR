# Are the Tasks Enjoyable?

Not surprisingly, research is fairly clear that employees who find their work inter- esting are more satisfied and motivated than employees who do not enjoy their jobs (Gately, ). Interestingly, although employees rank interesting work as being the most important factor in a job, supervisors rank salary and bonus as being the most important for employees. This discrepancy is why Glanz () advised employers to take innovative steps to make work more interesting.
