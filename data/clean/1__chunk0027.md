# Data Collection and Selection Criteria

The study systematically searches Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed to r etrieve peer-reviewed journals, books, conference papers, and policy documents. Gray literature, including government reports, industry white papers, and regulatory guidelines, is also analyzed to inc orporate real-world perspectives. Boolean search operators and keywords such as “AI hiring systems,” “disability discrimination,” and “ADA compliance” optimize retrieval. A three-phase screening process refines the selection:

- 1. Filter by publication year (2019–2025) to ensure up-to-date research. 2. Title and abstract review to determine relevance to AI hiring and disability inclusion 3. Full-text evaluation to confirm alignment with research objectives and methodological rigor.
