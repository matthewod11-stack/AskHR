# Lean into curiosity…

Your team likely has many things weighing on them: What’s the

forecast? Will there be more layoffs? How bad is it, really? It might be

tempting to redirect the conversation, but Eikenberg advises “getting

curious” instead. “The best thing leaders can do is create space for

people to reﬂect, to muse, and wonder,” she says. Ask them questions

about their experience: What are you concerned about? How is it

showing up day to day? And what does this mean for the core project

we’re working on? Beware: A lack of questions from your team doesn’t

necessarily signal all is well. If they’re not talking, Eikenberg suggests

checking in with a few “thermometers” on the ground—project leads,

coordinators, or others who aren’t in formal leadership roles but are

trusted and in the loop—to get a read.
