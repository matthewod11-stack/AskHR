To figure out the preferred communication style of youraudience, just ask. If you’re presenting to your manager or asenior colleague, ask your peers first. Particularly if you’re new,they’ll be more familiar with the leaders at your organization andhow they like to communicate. If that leads to a dead end, ask youaudience directly. You can say: “How do you typically like newideas or data delivered to you?”A third option is to experiment and see what lands. For instance,try using visuals to make a point in one presentation and bulletpoints in the next. Pay attention to what lands best with differentgroups. Be open, curious, and nonjudgmental. Then, evolve andshift your style based on the feedback you receive.. . .If you’re frustrated because you can’t sell your ideas, focus onpackaging them more effectively. Unfortunately, no idea — nomatter how good — can be greenlit without being presented in away that works for the audience.
