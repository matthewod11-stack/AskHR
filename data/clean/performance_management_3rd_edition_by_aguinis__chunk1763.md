## Part IV • Reward Systems, Legal Issues, and Team Performance Management

An exception to the visibility recommendation is that some individuals may prefer a nonvisible reward allocation to avoid being singled out for attention or to prevent the disruption of group harmony.

- Make rewards contingent.

Rewards should be tied to performance directly and exclusively. Imagine that an outsider is asked to guess the salary levels for various employees in an organization. Assume that she can ask the following questions: What do people do (e.g., administrative assistant, mailroom clerk, VP for HR)? How long have they done it? How well have they done it? If information based on the “How well?” question is not the most useful one in guessing what salaries are, then the organization is not making rewards contingent on performance. Unfortunately, this is the case in many organizations in which what people do and how long they have done it are far better predictors of their salaries than how well they perform. As an illustration, in many countries around the world, including Eritrea in Africa, all employees receive one month’s extra salary as a noncontin- gent reward each year.26 In other words, employees receive pay for a “13th month.” When rewards are not contingent on performance, organizations can alienate their best workers, precisely those who make the greatest contributions and can easily find employment elsewhere.

- Make rewards timely. Rewards should be given soon after the occurrence of the result or behavior being rewarded. Experimental psychologists know that if a mouse in a cage pulls a lever and a lump of sugar appears 10 months later (on the mouse’s anniversary date), no learning will take place. This is why many organi- zations implement on-the-spot rewards.27 For example, at Lake Federal Bank in Hamburg, Indiana, the president has an annual budget that he can use to give rel- atively small, spur-of-the-moment gifts to employees who are performing well. These spot bonuses do not have to be cash awards. They can be theater tickets, a prime parking space, or anything else that targets an employee’s specific needs. How does he know what type of reward to give? The answer is simple: He gets to know his employees and watches what they do and how they spend their time when they have a chance to choose. If this does not work, he can simply ask them. Increasing an employee’s base pay creates an annuity for the employee’s tenure with the organization. If mistakes are made in the allocation of increases in base salary (especially upward), they are usually irreversible and can be very costly over time. This is why variable pay, which is not added to an employee’s base salary, has become an attractive option for many organizations. Variable pay is consistent with the recommendations that rewards be contingent and reversible. If high-quality performance occurs again, then the employee receives the additional compensation again. If high-quality perform- ance does not occur, then the additional compensation is not given.

- Make rewards reversible.

- Use nonfinancial rewards. Unfortunately, many organizations underestimate the impact of nonfinancial rewards, including the following:

- Formal commendations and awards • Favorable mention in company publications • Private, informal recognition for jobs well done • Public recognition, including praise, certificate of accomplishment, and letters of appreciation
