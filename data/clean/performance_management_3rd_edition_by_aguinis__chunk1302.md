# 7.4.4 Self-Leadership Training

The goal of self-leadership (SL) training is to improve a rater’s confidence in her ability to manage performance. SL training techniques include positive self-talk, mental imagery, and positive beliefs and thought patterns.22 The assumption is that if there is increased self-direction, self-motivation, and confidence, there will be increased accuracy. Overall, SL emphasizes intrinsic (i.e., internal) sources of behavioral standards and emphasizes doing things for their intrinsic value.

SL training has become a popular tool in the context of performance management systems and as a type of training program beneficial for supervisors even when they are not necessarily involved in a performance management system. Several studies have shown that SL training can be effective in enhancing mental processes and increasing self-efficacy (i.e., the belief that one can do something if one tries). Designing an SL training program involves the following steps:23

- 1. Observe and record existing beliefs and assumptions, self-talk, and mental imagery patterns. For example, what are the beliefs about the performance man- agement system? How do managers visualize their role in the performance management system? Do they believe they have the capacity to observe and record performance accurately?

- 2. Analyze the functionality and constructiveness of the beliefs, self-talk, and imagery patterns uncovered in step 1. For example, are the beliefs about the system detri- mental to the system’s expected success?

- 3. Identify or develop more functional and constructive beliefs and assumptions, self-verbalizations, and mental images to substitute for dysfunctional ones; for example, develop images of employees being satisfied, as opposed to defensive and confrontational, after receiving performance feedback from their supervisors.
