(Cheung et al., 2023). CR for all variables exceeded the recommended cut-off of ≥ .70 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981; Hair et al., 2014), confirming the internal reliability of our measures.

Formal coaching status was measured using a single item: ‘In the past six months, how many one-on-one meetings (coaching conversations) has your direct supervisor had with you to discuss/improve your performance on the job?’ Participants scoring 1 or more were assigned to the coached group (formally coached). Participants scoring 0 were assigned to the no-coach group (i.e. informal coaching and no coaching). This measure differentiates between formal and informal coaching events because the wording empha- sises structured, one-on-one meetings and is specifically focused on discussing and improving job performance. This aligns with the characteristics of formal coaching which is planned, has a clear purpose, and is conducted in a dedicated setting, making it memorable. Also, because the measure asks for a count of discrete, identifiable coaching conversations over a six-month period, it suggests an expectation of scheduled events rather than casual, ad-hoc guidance. In contrast, informal coaching tends to be more spontaneous and weaved into everyday interactions without a set structure, making events harder to recall.

OCB Organisational and OCB Individual were measured using four items each from Lee and Allen (2002), coded 1 = never to 5 = almost always. Sample items include ‘I defend the organisation when other employees criticise it’ (organisational, CR = .80) and ‘I assist co-workers with their duties’ (individual, CR = .80).

Meaningful Work was measured using three items from Spreitzer (1995). A sample

item is ‘The work I do on this job is meaningful to me’ (CR = .94).

Turnover Intentions was measured using four items from Kelloway et al. (1999).

A sample item is ‘I am thinking about leaving my organisation’ (CR = .95).

Counterproductive Work Behaviours was measured using three items developed by Bennett and Robinson (2000) (from Labban & Bizzi, 2022), coded 1 = never to 5 = almost always. A sample item is ‘I put in little effort at work’ (CR = .80).
