## HBR / Digital Article / Using Data to Design Your Hybrid Work Policies

- A plan to revisit the norms and habits to which you commit at some

point in the future, to see if they’re working for everyone

at EY U.S. hasn’t always been smooth sailing, and we still consider our

approach a work in progress. But that’s the point: Real innovation is

communication and collaboration, and a lot of ﬁne-tuning. We believe

that it starts by putting your intuitions aside and really understanding

how hybrid work is impacting your people — in practice, not theory.
