# 3 EXPLORING EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS IN SEARCH FUND–ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

The most important question to ask

When deciding to terminate an employee, a CEO must first ask: “Why are we firing this person?” This fundamental question shifts the focus from solely evaluating the employee’s performance to considering whether the organization’s systems, processes, or leadership practices contributed to the situation at hand. A reflective approach not only promotes accountability but also reduces the likelihood of similar issues recurring in the future.

A CEO’s responsibilities extend beyond strategy setting to creating an environment where employees can thrive. This involves ensuring that hiring practices are robust enough to select candidates who align with the company’s needs, with regard to both skills and cultural fit. Missteps during recruitment often set the stage for later difficulties. Similarly, onboarding and training programs must adequately prepare employees for their roles. If employees are not provided clear expectations, proper mentorship, or sufficient training, they are likely to struggle, regardless of their potential.

An underperforming sales representative, for instance, may be struggling not due to a lack of effort or capability but because they lack access to a customer relationship management system or sufficient training and coaching to meet targets. Beyond individual resources, CEOs should assess whether broader team dynamics or systemic issues, such as poorly distributed workloads or conflicting priorities, have contributed to the employee’s difficulties.12

This process of reflection—asking “Where did we go wrong?”—helps uncover gaps in the company’s structure or leadership. By taking accountability for organizational shortcomings, CEOs can reinforce a culture of continuous improvement. Such an approach not only helps prevent future missteps but also demonstrates to employees that leadership is committed to fairness and learning. Importantly, this perspective aligns with research emphasizing the importance of transparent and structured termination processes.13 Thoughtful reflection on leadership’s role fosters trust, preserves morale, and ensures that decisions are viewed as just and measured. While the entire blame for an employee separation cannot rest with the company and CEO, at least some of it does. If an employee is being dropped, the company is responsible for at least some of the failure.

Four critical areas (Figure 2) are frequent points of breakdown that can set employees up for difficulty from the start. Addressing these systemic issues not only reduces the likelihood of underperformance but also strengthens organizational stability by fostering an environment where employees are positioned to succeed. Recognizing and correcting these failures ensures that dismissals are reserved for genuine cases of misalignment, while helping to build a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.

When considering these four critical areas, it is vital to remember that building a balanced and effective team requires leaders to recognize that not every employee will be an “A player,” nor should they need to be. Instead of striving for uniformly high achievers, successful organizations embrace the value of diverse strengths, understanding that steady, reliable performers are just as critical as top-tier talent. Especially in small businesses and search funds, an overemphasis on finding exceptional performers can lead to unnecessary turnover and the loss of employees who contribute meaningfully, albeit quietly. Effective leadership involves identifying and developing potential across all levels, offering opportunities for growth, and creating an environment where “B players” can evolve into strong contributors.
