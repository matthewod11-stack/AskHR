# Realistic Job Previews

Because recruitment sources have only a slight effect on tenure of future employees, using other methods during the recruitment process may be helpful in recruiting applicants who will be successful. One such method is the realistic job preview (RJP). RJPs involve giving an applicant an honest assessment of a job. For example, instead of telling the applicant how much fun she will have working on the assem- bly line, the recruiter honestly tells her that although the pay is well above average, the work is often boring and there is little chance for advancement.

The logic behind RJPs is that even though telling the truth scares away many applicants (Saks, Wiesner, & Summers, ), especially the most qualified ones (Bretz & Judge, ), the ones who stay will not be surprised about the job. Because they know what to expect, informed applicants will tend to stay on the job longer than applicants who did not understand the nature of the job. For example, an RJP at a long-distance trucking company increased job satisfaction and reduced annual turnover from % to % (Taylor, ).

In a meta-analysis of  RJP studies, Phillips () found that although RJPs result in lower turnover, higher job satisfaction, and better performance, the size of the effect is rather small. The meta-analysis also suggested that RJPs will be most effective if they are given in an oral rather than a written format, and if they are given to the applicant at the time of the job offer rather than earlier in the recruitment process or after the job offer has been accepted.

In another meta-analysis, Shetzer and Stackman () found that RJPs dis- cussing opportunities for career advancement (d = .) were more effective than ones without a career component (d = .). These two meta-analyses indicate that RJPs, especially if they are conducted orally and contain a career component, may be useful in the recruitment process.

A variation of the RJP is a technique called an expectation-lowering procedure (ELP). Unlike an RJP, which focuses on a particular job, an ELP lowers an applicant’s expectations about work and expectations in general (Buckley, Mobbs, Mendoza, Novicevic, Carraher, & Beu, ). For example, an RJP might include a statement such as, “this job is performed in a very small space, in high levels of heat, with few opportunities for social interaction,” whereas an ELP might include a statement such as:

We often start a new job with high expectations, thinking the job will be perfect. As you will discover, no job is perfect and there will be times when you become frustrated by your supervisor or your coworkers. Prior to accept- ing this job, be sure to give some thought regarding whether this job and our organization will meet the expectations that you have. Also, give some thought to whether your expectations about work are realistic.
