# 398 Forensic Psychology

were the most popular topics. Hutchins and Slesinger (1928a, 1928b, 1928c, 1929) carried out a series of studies on the law of evidence, looking at “consciousness of guilt,” memory, spontaneous exclamations, and hearsay.

The ﬁrst textbook in the area written by a psychologist was Legal Psychology by Howard Burtt (1931), also a student of Münsterberg’s. In 1935, psychologist Edward Robinson wrote Law and the Lawyers, in which he argued that “every legal problem is at bottom a psychological prob- lem and . . . every one of the many legal traditions about human nature which are to be found in legal training needs to be gone over from the standpoint of modern psychologi- cal knowledge” (Robinson, 1935, p. 51). This controversial book, like Münsterberg’s, was received negatively by legal reviewers (e.g., Mechem, 1936), who asserted that psychol- ogy did not have the necessary knowledge to provide “plain psychological facts” (Robinson’s term) that would be useful to the legal system. Robinson also recommended that psy- chological researchers investigate the behavioral premises implicit in legal doctrines. Loh (1981, p. 319) later pointed out that “This modest and sensible proposition, embedded as it was in his more impassioned diatribes against the conser- vatism of the law, was lost on his legal critics.”
