approaches, and although we have some insights about handling missing data in longitudinal studies, the nature of the missing data (MAR or NMAR) for longitudinal studies of job performance, the comparison of missing data techniques with LGCM versus HLM, and the implications of not employing missing data techniques with HLM, are unaddressed.

For the prediction of job performance over time, turnover is also a key outcome. One cannot really study performance over time without consider- ing when performance no longer exists. While much of the discussion so far has focused on explaining or modeling existing data, understanding turnover and job performance is important for any sort of prediction problem. This leads to a third set of theoretical and methodological research questions:

(cid:4) Is missing data in longitudinal studies of job performance MAR or

NMAR?

(cid:4) How should turnover and missing data be incorporated into models of job
