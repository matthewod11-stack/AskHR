system-level or strategic framework they have failed to outline how this should occur (Gubman, 2004; Jackson & Schuler, 1990; Sears, 2002; Walker, 1980).

Perhaps the earliest attempt to explicitly tie business strategy to human resource management was made by Tichy, Fombrun, and Devanna (1982). They outlined types of strategies organizations may adopt and the organizational structures (functional, decentralized, etc.) and human resources management practices (selection, development, etc.) that best support them. In essence, Tichy et al. (1982) encourage HR departments to become more strategic by understanding the business strategy of the organization and restructuring both the HR organization and practices to support it. Jackson and Schuler (1990) elaborated by outlining how the HR planning activities (assessing HR demand and supply, implementing programs and evaluating outcomes) might be linked to organizational variables (e.g. the organization's strategy, life cycle stage, competitive environment) over several time horizons.

Consistent with our earlier analogy of Talent Management as architecture we believe that explicit ties need to be made between strategy and talent. An early attempt to do so through the lens of changes wrought by technological innovation was attempted by Zuboff (1988), who proposed that changes in technology produce changes in the talent required to use that technology. For instance, she notes that implementing automated manufacturing systems changes the talent pool required not only by eliminating manual work, but also by changing the nature of the information gathered from the process and how it is managed. Data previously known only to the human operator manually working a product (temperature variations, etc.) now are explicitly collected and displayed to a process control operator who must possess very different skills (Richman, 1989). Stewart (1997) applied this idea to talent in general by comparing the value of talent with the difficulty of replacing it (see Fig. 1).

In the lower two quadrants of Fig. 1 are the talent pools that are easily replaced either because they add no unique value because training time is short or processes are automated or because they are readily available due to a strong pool of free-lance or temporary talent.

In the upper quadrants are the difficult to replace pools. Low value but difficult to replace talent (the upper left hand quadrant of Fig. 1) are the talent pools that have highly specialized skills that add no incremental value to the customer (such as skilled staff functions). In the upper right quadrant are the hard to replace high value talent pools that are, in Stewart's view, “a company's human capital” (p. 91). Stewart makes the sage observation that much of this high value, difficult-to-replace talent does not sit at the highest levels of the organization. We suspect they would not show up on most high-potential talent lists either.

Zuboff (1988) outlines some of the strategic talent implications of these classifications by recommending specific actions. For instance, low-value, difficult-to-replace talent can yield higher value if the jobs are made more consultative and information-rich. Jobs in the lower right quadrant (easy-to-replace, high value added) should either be redesigned to be unique and differentiated from the competition (thus made more difficult to replace) or outsourced. Zuboff focused specifically on the talent implications of technology changes but the same analysis can be applied to demographic and business condition changes.

Compare this talent approach to the A, B, C rankings discussed earlier. Rather than simply ranking talent, Zuboff introduces market issues into the decisions to be made with respect to talent.

Suppose, for instance, that an organization's “A” players are predominantly in the bottom left quadrant of Fig. 1. What if its “high potential” pool is disproportionately in the upper left quadrant? This approach appears to be more strategic than the ones reviewed earlier because it is more sensitive to the conditions faced by the firm (an element of the models of both Tichy et al. (1982) and Jackson and Schuler (1990) largely not apparent in
