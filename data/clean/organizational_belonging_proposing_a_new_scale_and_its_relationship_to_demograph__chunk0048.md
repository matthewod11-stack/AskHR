# Data analyses

First, demographic and organization variables on each company sample were checked for differences before combining into an overall sample. The combined data was then used. Frequency analyses for nominal demographic and organization variables are reported first (Table 1). The nature of the research question asked dictated the statistical analysis to be used (Stevens, 1996). Exploratory factor analysis was used (Table 2) to reduce the 27 OB items into more usable scales to test RQ1. Means, standard deviations, and correlations were performed on continuous demographic, organization, OB scales, and outcome variables (Table 3). Correlation analysis was used to test RQ2. independent samples t-tests were also used to test RQ2. Hierarchical regression analy- ses were used to test RQ3. Any required pre-recoding of variables to run the above analyses will be reported. SPSS-PC (SPSS, 2021) was used for all data analyses. Following Hopkins, Marshall, Batterham, and findings at a p<.05 or p<.01value (two-tailed) will be Hanin (2008), reported as statistically significant, while findings at a p<.10 value (two- tailed) will be labeled as marginally significant. For the open item, the collectively analyzed each response and agreed on coding authors each respondentâ€™s answers, ideally into at least one of the created OB scales.
