## Tensions around the Need to Address Diversity in Ecological Research

In addition to assessing environments, both physical and psychological, community psychologists have also sought to integrate ecological theory into research through the study of culture. Steele, Trickett, and Labarta (1981) suggested that a focus on culture is congruent with an ecological approach because “attention paid to the interaction of person and envi- ronment, provides a framework from which to examine the functional aspects of behaviors and structures in culturally diverse environments” (p. 5). This line of inquiry seeks to contextualize knowledge of individual behavior.

Asyet,communitypsychologyasadisciplinehasnotmade substantial progress to understand social problems in the con- text of cultural norms and values. Community psychologists are part of a larger context of psychologists that have long been criticized for not respectingdiversityandviewingdevia- tions from white culture as problematic.
