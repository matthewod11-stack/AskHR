In , the Shoney’s restaurant chain settled a racial discrimination case for $ million. Most of the money went to approximately , African Americans who either worked for or were denied employment with Shoney’s over a -year period. The size of the settlement was based not only on the high number of victims but also on the severity of the discrimination. For example, the number of African American employees in each restaurant was limited to the percentage of African American customers. When African Americans were hired, they were placed in low-paying kitchen jobs. In addition to the $ million, Shoney’s agreed to institute an affirmative action program over the next  years. Texaco settled its racial discrimination suit in  by agreeing to pay $ million to , current and former African American employees. The settlement was prompted by the public airing of a tape recording of a Texaco executive using a racial slur. In , the Morgan Stanley brokerage house settled a sex discrimination complaint for $ million. In , Abercrombie & Fitch settled a sex and race discrimination complaint for $ million.

If a settlement cannot be reached, however, the case goes to a federal district court, with the EEOC representing (physically and financially) the person filing the complaint. When the district court makes a decision, the decision becomes case law. Case law is a judicial interpretation of a law and is important because it establishes a precedent for future cases. If one side does not like the decision rendered in a lower court, it may take the case to one of the  circuit courts of appeal. A ruling by a circuit court of appeals serves as binding case law only for that particular circuit. That is why, in this chapter, the circuit is identified along with most of the court cases.

If either side does not like the appeals court decision, it can ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review it. The Supreme Court will consider a case only if the decision is legally important or if the rulings on an issue are inconsistent across the circuit courts. Obviously, a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court carries the most weight, followed by appeals court rulings, and then district court rulings.
