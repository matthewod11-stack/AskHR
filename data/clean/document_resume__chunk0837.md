# Performance Appraisal

lost every cases Job analysis should be conduct,-%1 when duties are reasonably stable so that conditions will be comparable to those which will exist when the performance appraisal instrument is used.

Performance Criteria. While traits such as initiative, enthusiasm, attitude, and loyalty are important to job performance, most often they are not suitable as performance criteria.61 It is better to develop criteria which describe observable job behaviors or outcomes. Even when the possession of a trait can be shown as critical for effective job performance, it is usually possible to design an observable measurement based on how job duties actually are performed.

Appraisal Instruments. The various instruments should facilitate the admin- istration of performance appraisal under standardized and controlled conditions.8 Instruments should be designed carefully to accommodate both the criteria and method. If several criteria or scales are to be combined, the instrument should produce a com- posite rating based on the rules of combination!) Appropriate identification, comments, and signatory sections should be included.

5.

Reliability and Validity. To achieve the organization's purpose of accurately measuring performance and to satisfy legal requirements, the appraisal system must be valid; it must measure what it purports to measure. First, however, the system must be reliable. The ratings must yield stable and consistent results from one period to the next and across all items.'Â°. Reliability and validity studies should be conducted to meet technical standards of the "Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures" and documented in a written reporin

6.

Testing the System. Prior to implementation of performance appraisal, a review should be conducted to ensure that the process selected supports overall objec- tives and will provide the needed information flew to such decision areas as compensa- tion, placement, and professional development. In many cases it may be necessary to conduct a pilot or "shakedown" test of the system to identify and address problem areas and work out procedural matters.12

7.

Communication of Policy and Purpose. The purpose and uses of perfor- mance appraisal should be stated clearly in the organizational policy as well as in the employee or faculty handbook. Procedures should be developed to cover which systems will be used for which jobs or job families, how often appraisals are to be con- ducted, documentation required, recourse, and similar matters. Fully informing all individuals of policies will minimize uncertainty and resistance and will increase the probability of positive results.13

8.

Rater Training. In many organizations, the task of observing and measuring job performance is poorly carried out. Research has indicated that rater training is more important than design considerations in improving accuracy of performance appraisal. Training programs should focus on improving rater skills in observing, recording, and appraising behavior with less emphasis given to such issues as rating distributions and
