## In their 2007/2008 Staying@Work report, Watson

Wyatt Worldwide, an international consulting firm, reported that 48% of employers surveyed agreed that the stress levels in their companies were high, but only 5% of them said that they were doing anything to help reduce employee stress. Even though stress-related illness costs businesses an estimated $300 billion a year that comes from turnover, layoffs, low productivity, work-related accidents, high insurance premiums, and legal fees, companies don’t make the project of reducing workplace stress a top priority.

The question becomes, whose responsibility is it to reduce, or at least, better manage workplace stress? Should the employee be held accountable for finding ways to reduce their stress and the negative impact it has on them? Or, ethically, is it the responsibility of companies to find ways to reduce employee stress and keep employees healthy?

Many people would say that, because of the

dangerous health issues caused by high stress, busi- nesses should be doing more to help reduce it or to help employees better manage it. In March of 2008, the APA recognized five organizations that did believe it was companies’ responsibility to promote employee health and well-being. These companies believe that they have an ethical responsibility to reduce the chances of any employee having to suffer the debilitating effects of extreme, long-term stress.

They recognize that because of the demands placed on workers by companies and because workers have no control over what is expected of them, companies should do whatever they can to make work less stress- ful or less unhealthy.

Others say that it is the responsibility of indi- viduals to find ways to decrease or better manage their stress. Employees have options: there are fit- ness centers they can join, they can stop smoking, reduce their consumption of alcohol or caffeinated drinks, or read self-help books. They can seek help from counselors or other health professionals. Com- panies are in the business of making money, not of ensuring that people are healthy. Companies can’t make and shouldn’t be expected to make people take better care of themselves. And because what is stressful to one person may not be stressful to another, it is impossible to find and offer any one solution that’s going to help everyone who is feeling stressed out because of the demands of their jobs. It would be too costly to companies to offer enough stress-reducing alternatives that would address the needs of all employees.

What do you think? 7

Do you think companies have an ethical responsi- bility to offer solutions for employees that will help reduce stress? Do you think companies are to blame for the high stress levels in the workplace? What are some things that companies can offer or do for their employees? Do you think employees have any responsibility for ensuring they stay healthy under stressful condi- tions? If so, what are some things that employees can do for themselves?
