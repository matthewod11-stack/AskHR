outcomes in a medical center setting. Although they found a pos- itive relationship between similarity on agreeableness and job per- formance, their results indicated a negative relationship between conscientiousness congruence and organizational tenure, and no relationship between extraversion similarity and any work-related outcome. Similarly, in a study of 476 managers and professionals working in a large government agency, Tischler (1996) found no evidence of a signiﬁcant relationship between individuals’ similar- ity to the modal organizational personality type on the Myers- Briggs Type Indicator with either salary increases or number of promotions over time. Finally, in a study of training performance of ﬂight attendants, Ferris, Youngblood, and Yates (1985) found no support for a relationship between newcomer-incumbent per- sonality congruence and withdrawal behaviors, with congruence assessed as the correlation between the employee’s 16PF (Cattell, 1970) proﬁle and the proﬁle of an average successful incumbent. The second way personality-based PO ﬁt is typically assessed is by testing for an interaction between an individual’s traits and “ob- jective” organizational characteristics, like reward system or size. Using this approach, commensurate measurement between indi- vidual traits and organizational characteristics is not necessary. Un- like studies of personality congruence that evaluate supplementary ﬁt, these studies appear to be assessing complementary ﬁt, in which the environment meets the needs or preferences of the individual (Muchinsky & Monahan, 1987). Thus, the basis for what consti- tutes a ﬁt is very different in these types of studies. In addition, these studies emphasize ﬁt on speciﬁc personality traits, whereas most of the congruence studies assess similarity of individual and organizational personality proﬁles. Because proﬁle correlations conceal the individual contribution of the speciﬁc traits (Edwards, 1993), it is difﬁcult to determine whether there are important ﬁt relationships that are being concealed in the overall proﬁle.

In contrast to the personality congruence studies, results of studies using the interaction approach have successfully demon- strated signiﬁcant effects of personality-based PO ﬁt. Turban and Keon (1993) found that job seekers’ personality characteristics of self-esteem and need for achievement moderated the impact of or- ganizational characteristics such as centralization, size, and reward structure on organizational attraction. Similarly, Bretz and col-
