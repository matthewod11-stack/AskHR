Younger women face ageism.

Finally, younger women are the most likely to confront ageism at work.

While unfair treatment based on a person’s age is most commonly

thought to harm older adults, we found that “youngism” is just as

signiﬁcant a problem. Almost half of younger women say their age has

negatively impacted their careers — that’s more than any other age

group. And younger women are nearly twice as likely as younger men

to report unwanted attention being drawn to their age. Ageism impacts

older employees, too, but to a lesser extent, and older men and older

women experience it at fairly similar rates.

Given the current state of aﬀairs, perhaps it’s not surprising that

younger women are twice as likely as older women to say their gender

will make it harder for them to get ahead.

Younger men don’t prioritize gender equity.

What’s more, the next generation of men doesn’t appear to be pushing

for change. While the younger women in our study stand out as the

most committed to gender and racial diversity issues, younger men are

clearly the least. And over the past ﬁve years, the percentage of younger

men who claim gender and racial diversity as high personal priorities

also declined signiﬁcantly. This is all consistent with other research

suggesting that Gen Z men may care even less about gender equality
