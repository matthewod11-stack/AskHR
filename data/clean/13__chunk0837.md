only engage in half of the appreciation process (i.e., the cognitive part) but could not experience humor in the same way that people with undamaged brains do.

into the relationship between humor and brain activity, and is consistent with Edward DeBono’s conclusion that ‘‘Humor is by far the most signiﬁcant activity of the human brain.’’ In an important brain imaging study, Goel and Dolan (2001) exposed participants to different types of humor, and observed their corresponding patterns of brain activity. Importantly, they found that different types of humor (i.e., semantic jokes and puns) were associated with brain activity in different parts of the brain, which, they hypothesized, corresponded to different types of processing. However, when the humor was perceived as amusing, different types of humor appeared to activate some common areas of the brain. Importantly, the common part of the brain that was activated in response to humor is thought to be a ‘‘reward center,’’ and the cognitive and emotional mechanisms supports the argument involved in the humor appreciation process might be integrated and related, yet unique. Similar results were also found in a recent study by Watson, Matthews, and Allman (2007), who found reward center-related activity in response to different types of humor (i.e., sight gags and language-based humor), as well as brain activity commonly associated with feelings of euphoria. Thus, the appreciation of humor might be intrinsically rewarding, and might result in tendencies for individuals to seek out humorous stimuli such as individuals who consistently make them laugh.
