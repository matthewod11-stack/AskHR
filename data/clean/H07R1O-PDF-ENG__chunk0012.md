## the New CEO Workshop at Harvard Business School, as chairman of

a venture capital ﬁrm, and as a member of corporate boards — I

have observed CEOs facing enormous emotional strain over the last

few years. For many companies, the period from the end of the Great

Recession until the beginning of Covid-19 will be remembered as

unusually calm and prosperous, a period typiﬁed by low interest rates,

a steadily growing economy, and a buoyant stock market. In retrospect,

these were fantastic years to be a CEO. More recently, however, chief

executives have faced extraordinary challenges that have increased the

emotional labor required by the role.
