## INCREASED EMPHASIS ON LEARNING LEADERSHIP

A major change has also taken place in the introductory session of the clinic. Formerly, this opening session provided a standard overview of leadership with large group icebreakers. Based on the results of our own line of re- search on youth captainship and other recent studies in the area, we have identiﬁed a need to additionally emphasize leadership as a skill that can be learned. For example, in a recent qualitative study examining the high school captaincy experience of 13 former high school captains, a surpris- ing number of participants reported that they believe that leaders are only born (Voelker et al., 2010). What may be gleaned from this ﬁnding is that not every CLTP participant believes there is something they can change about their leadership potential, ability, skills, or effectiveness. This attitude defeats the purpose of attending a clinic to improve leadership. The introduc- tory session to the program now therefore emphasizes leadership as a skill that can be developed and reﬁned with time, experience, mentorship, and education.
