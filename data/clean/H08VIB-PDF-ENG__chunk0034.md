discussion works best with small groups of 3–4 people. It’s indeed more

practical to integrate AI in a team discussion with fewer people: either

by typing or dictating. If you have more participants, consider using a

large screen or splitting into sub-teams, each with their own “AI at one

Don’t let the prompter dominate. The person interacting with the

AI on behalf of the team shouldn’t take over the session, either

from a facilitation/process or content perspective. This is particularly

relevant when typing. Make sure everyone’s input is captured. How? By
