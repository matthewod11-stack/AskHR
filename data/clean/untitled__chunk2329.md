# Demographic Descriptions

Estimates are that there are at least 30,000 school psycholo- gists in the United States, perhaps constituting one-third of all school psychologists on earth (Oakland, 2000). Prac- titioners in the ﬁeld are approximately 70% female, pre- dominantly Caucasian (at least 90%), have a median age of about 41 to 45 years, and have a median of 11 to 15 years of experience. School-based practitioners work within a psychologist-to-schoolchildren ratio of 1 to 1,800–2,000.
