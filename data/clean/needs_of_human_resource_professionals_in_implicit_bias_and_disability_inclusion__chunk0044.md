## 3.1. Educational information on implicit and explicit bias

The first theme highlighted the impact of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination against people with disabilities on community participation and employment opportunities. HR professionals emphasized the importance of instilling educational, research, and intervention information on implicit biases in disability bias training to promote self-awareness that disability biases can affect decisions to interview, hire, retain, and promote people with disabilities in the workplace. Participants’ responses included: “Stereotypes are very real and are limitations and obstacles for people with disabilities. There is a need for education and information on implicit and explicit biases to increase awareness and help us understand a little bit more about people and how they think and where people come from.”

Participants further elaborated on the specific type of information needed to provide education regarding these biases: “We need examples… sharing examples at work where people with disabilities have been discriminated against or not given a chance or those opportunities. It’s that real life of understanding how people make assumptions or jump to conclusions and not even realize their biases.” Participants also indicated training should include: “What works? Why does it work? What to improve? How to improve?”
