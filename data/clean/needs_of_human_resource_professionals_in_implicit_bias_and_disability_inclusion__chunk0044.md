analyzed using qualitative content analysis (QCA) methodology. QCA is a research method for making replicable and valid inferences from data to their context, with the purpose of providing knowledge, new insights, a representation of facts and a practical guide to action (Krippendorff, 1980). QCA allows researchers to understand the meanings of data by refining responses into concepts and examining relationships among the concepts to identify major themes that summarize the narrative data (Elo & Kyng√§s, 2008). QCA is a qualitative inquiry approach frequently used by rehabilitation counseling researchers (Bezyak et al., 2018; Dutta et al., 2016; Fitzgerald et al., 2017).
