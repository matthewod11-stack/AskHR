Last fall, McKinsey’s “Women in the Workplace” report found that

women continue to face blockers in the transition from entry-level

positions to management roles. The problem — likened to a “broken

rung” on the career ladder — has stunted women’s advancement and

led to a persistent gender gap in senior leadership positions. The trend

is most dire for women of color, who this past year have seen previous

gains slip substantially.
