Having a well-designed performance' appraisal instrument and process is essential if the resulting evaluations are to be useful. However, even the most carefully con- structed devices and programs will not assure success in gathering valuable; information if the human beings who use the instruments are not willing or able to employ them properly.

The persons who observe and appraise performance are very much a part of the measurement process. No matter how fine an instrument they are using, if the raters are unreliable or invalid in their observations and appraisals, then the resulting information will be unreliable and invalid, and thus, not suitable for any purpose

Unfortunately, human beings tend to be very poor evaluators of behavior, as the

following except from the work of John Bernardin and Richard Beatty attests.

Research in psychology is replete with examples of the potential difficulties confronting performance appraisers People apparently do not attend very well to base-rate information; they express excessive and unjustified confidence in their judgments; they make predictive judgments that are biased in comparison with normative standards; they are subject to hindsight biases, they have self- serving biases in person perception, they underestimate the role of contextual factors affecting behavior, their judgments of emanation are inaccurate, they resort to erroneous judgmental heuristics. and so on .. . and on.. . There can be no question that some raters of performance commit these errors in judgment, as well as many others)

The existence of these and other rater error s hay e been know n for years.2.i.i Some of the more common errors ,klueli ha, 'seen identified and studied in detail are described in Exhibit 6.I.s
