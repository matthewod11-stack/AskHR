capital resources depends on the linkages between learning at the micro (individual), group or team, and macro levels, human capital development must also be examined from a cross-level or mesolevel perspective. Typically, strategy research focuses on identifying organizational-level phenomena that generate above-normal returns. However, strategy research is beginning to recognize that microlevel phenomena, including individual knowledge, preferences, and beliefs, can also have important influences on firm performance (e.g., Foss 2011, Mollick 2012). Con- currently,therehas beenapushforindustrialand organizationalpsychology researchtostudy the psychological basis for a firm’s competitive advantage, including the development of multilevel theory to understand how microlevel and macrolevel phenomena and their interaction contribute to competitive advantage (Ployhart 2012).

Strategic learning and financial performance. Training for the sake of training is not aligned with today’s business reality (Aguinis & Kraiger 2009). Learning initiatives need to be designed, delivered, and evaluated, and their benefits clearly documented relative to strategic priorities. Learning must be evaluated in terms of the resulting economic gains relative to costs, recognizing that such relationships may not be linear, as there may well be points of diminishing returns (e.g., Bunderson & Sutcliffe 2003). There are a number of different ways learning can impact an organization’s financial performance by improving revenue or reducing costs, some more direct thanothers,includingimproved efficiency,innovation,motivation, retention,andreputation. For example, Van Iddekinge et al. (2009) examined how training procedures impacted different aspects of unit or organizational performance over time. Using a sample of units of a fast-food organization, they found that variation in the use of training was related to unit performance and that changes in the use of training over time was related to change in unit performance over time including service performance, unit retention, and unit financial performance.

The field could benefit from more macrolevel research investigating questions that relate to the strategic role of learning, such as how to best structure the learning function (e.g., university model, business-embedded model), how training activities should vary by employees’ strategic value, and learning’s relative importance for firm performance compared with other human resource management (HRM) practices such as selection and compensation. Tannenbaum’s (2002) model of the strategic training and development process could be a useful framework for such research. Tannenbaum’s model suggests that effective learning practices are based on the linkages between the business strategy and metrics, strategic training and development goals, and specific training and development activities. Strategic HRM scholars provide another potentially useful perspective for macrolevel research. They suggest that because the strategic impact of human resources is contingent on its contribution to the effectiveness of strategic business pro- cesses,thevalueofthisimpactcanbebestrealizedbyfocusingonstrategicjobsorthestrategiccore of the workforce related to critical business processes (e.g., Becker & Huselid 2006). A number of questions need to be addressed to understand the development of human capital as a strategic resource. We need to identify and examine those knowledge-related factors that contribute to the strategic nature of certain jobs. Also, research is needed to identify the types of learning that facilitate the acquisition of tacit and other types of knowledge necessary for effectiveness in strategic roles.

Creativity and innovation. Lopez-Cabrales et al. (2009) demonstrated that collaborative HRM practices increased the uniqueness of knowledge. Uniqueness of knowledge mediated the re- lationship between collaborative HRM practices and innovative activity, with innovation in turn contributing positively to firm performance. In contrast, knowledge-based HRM practices contributed to the value of knowledge (the extent to which employee knowledge can improve the
