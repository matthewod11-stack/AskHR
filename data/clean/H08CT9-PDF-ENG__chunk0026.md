## Our research identiﬁed six speciﬁc emotional and behavioral signals

leaders should look for in their teams:

- Lack of clarity on how to proceed, often accompanied by a spike in

anxiety or static energy levels as teams can’t make progress.

- Delays, slow progress, or missed milestones, which can trigger

frustration, stress, and anxiety, and lead to teams stopping working

or pulling away from the program.

- Ineﬀective collaboration, or when groups retreat to silos instead of

working together to solve complex problems. In this case you might

see the language shift from “we” to “you” as teams regress to an “us vs.

them” mindset.

- Increase in negative emotions, such as anger or frustration, as

problems go unaddressed or employees feel close to burnout.
