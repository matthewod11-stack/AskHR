## Firing an Employee at Kohl’s Department Store

Three employees were

fired from the Kohl’s Department Store in Mechanicsville, Virginia, for violating the store policy about using coupons. The store sent each employee 11 15%-off coupons as part of a “friends and family” sale: one coupon was for the employee and the other ten were to be given to family and friends. There were a lot of extra coupons, so on a Saturday, 18-year-old Rikki Groves, Rebecca Hagen, and Katie Kombacher gave the coupons to customers who did not have one. They assumed that these coupons were similar to other sale coupons used by the store and that the cashier could scan an already used coupon for a customer who did not have a coupon. According to Groves, who had been with Kohl’s for 3 months, none of the mangers told employees

that these coupons were different from those processed every day. A few days after the incident, the person in charge of store security called Groves into a closed-door meeting a few hours before the end of her shift. He began to interrogate Groves, telling her that he had observed her using the coupons through the store camera and that she would have to pay the store $1,000 to cover the coupons she gave to customers or the store would call the police and have her arrested for embezzlement. The head of store security then began taking pictures of her and required her to sign a document that barred her from returning to the store for the next year. Groves started making payments toward the $1,000 when the story was published in a local newspaper. After outraged citizens

complained and threatened to cut up their Kohl’s credit cards and stop patronizing the store, the store returned Groves’s money and said she would not have to pay it back. The three women were not offered their jobs back nor were they given an apology. A spokesperson for the local police department indicated that the threat of arrest used by Kohl’s was incorrect because what Groves did was not a crime, but a matter of internal policy.

How could the store have better handled the termination? Should the three employees have been fired?

What could Kohl’s have done to have prevented the situation in the first place? What could the employees have done differently?
