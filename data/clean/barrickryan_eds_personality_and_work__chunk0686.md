# Trainee Readiness

In the past forty years of research on training, the primary indi- vidual differences of interest have fallen under the broad factors of intelligence and experience. These two factors are directly re- lated to issues of trainee readiness, that is, whether individuals have the aptitude (Duke & Ree, 1996; Ree, Carretta, & Teachout, 1995) or background experiences necessary to be successful in the train- ing program. For example, Robertson and Downs (1989) report on twenty years of research that found it is possible to predict train- ing success across a large number of jobs (for example, carpentry, welding, and forklift operation) by having individuals learn about and perform a sample of the tasks to be learned in training.

More relevant to our chapter, trainee readiness does not in- clude just ability and skill components. For example, Tubiana and Ben-Shakhar (1982) found that a host of personality and motiva- tional factors contributed to trainee readiness. Sociability, active- ness, responsibility, independence, promptness, and motivation to serve in a combat unit added to the prediction of training success over and above success predicted by intelligence, education, and language scores.
