Non-financial areas are important ingredients to reach financial growth goals. Atlas

Copco has developed culture where employees have the possibility to grow their

knowledge and career and feel safe and motivated to bring new innovative products

to the market. It is not just a phrase: “The most valuable asset of the company are the

people”. The company provides many initiatives to drive the employee experience

journey. “The company believes that diversity and inclusion promote innovation,

strengthen employee engagement and lead to better decision making. Creating an

atmosphere where all employee feels appreciated where they can align their

individual purpose with the organizational purpose, bringing their true selves to work

every day” (Atlas Copco, 2021, p. 42)

Safety and Wellbeing is also a key part of the employee experience journey where

the company has set high priority. Covid-19 challenged all organizations and led them

to a new reality with a focus on safety and well-being by eliminating hazards and

reducing occupational health and safety risks.

Atlas Copco operates in four business areas decentralized across all continents and

serving customers in 180 countries, however corporate culture is characterized by a

commitment to people, customers, products, and innovations. The company ensures

that group culture cascades down to each employee everywhere in the world. Atlas

Copco believes “there is always a better way” and in many areas of our work we help

the company improve products or processes, but this meaning also has deeper social

aspects. For example, the company signs up for scientific targets to decrease CO2

emissions. According to CEO Mats Rahmstrom: “Our Science-based targets will lead

the way. They are the link between the Paris agreement and real actions to limit the

global warming in the world. As a leading industrial innovator and global supplier, we

can make a huge difference, also when it comes to battling climate change. We are

engaged in this race, there is no turning point”. (Atlas Copco, 2021, p. 3) Atlas Copco

with other well-known companies is fully committed and engaged to improve quality

of life and make difference for all humankind.
