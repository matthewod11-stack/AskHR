# 1.4.1. Vision, Mission and Strategy

The Atlas Copco vision “First in Mind, first in Choice” is not meant only for customers,

but it cascades down to all employees and other stakeholders. The corresponding

mission is to “Achieve sustainable, profitable growth”, meaning that all of our efforts

are directed to producing long-lasting results while protecting people, profit, and the

environment. On a corporate level, there are six focus areas which group financial

and non-financial goals and they are separated into the objectives which help

accomplish and maintain the company vision and mission. All six focus areas have

their own targets on a group level which can vary from the targets of each specific

division. However, all divisions contribute to the overall group targets.
