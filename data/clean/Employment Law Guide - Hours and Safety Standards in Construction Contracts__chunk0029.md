# Worker Rights

The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA) provides workers on covered contracts the

right to receive not less than one and one-half times their basic rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a

workweek on such contracts. The Wage and Hour Division accepts complaints of alleged CWHSSA wage violations. Wage and Hour Division local oﬃces are listed at www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm.

It is prohibited to retaliate against or ﬁre workers or job applicants for engaging in protected activities such as

making a complaint or cooperating in a Wage and Hour Division investigation under the CWHSSA.

The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA) does not have its own posting requirement. However, if the contract to which CWHSSA applies is subject to the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts'

be posted. If the contract to which CWHSSA applies is subject to the Service Contract Act's requirements, the

"Worker Rights on Government Contracts" poster must be posted. The appropriate poster(s) must be posted

at the worksite in a prominent and accessible place where it may be easily seen by workers. There is no size requirement for these posters but they must be easily readable.
