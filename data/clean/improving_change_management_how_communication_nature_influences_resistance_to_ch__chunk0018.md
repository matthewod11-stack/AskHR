## communications in change processes (Ford and Ford, 1995; Kotter, 1996; Lewis and

Seibold, 1996; Daly, Eague et al., 2003; Elving, 2005), and according to some of them,

communications and organizational change are inextricably linked processes (Lewis,

1999). It can be easily found, throughout the literature review, that change is a

communicative challenge (Allen et al 2007), or in another similar view, that change

implementation is primarily a communication problem (Lewis and Seibold, 1998). As

Bordia et al (2004: 96) illustrate:“Communication processes are inherently a part of

these implementation activities”.

Thus, it is necessary to look deeper into relational and communicational

processes while recognizing that sensemaking and sensegiving, and consequently

change itself, are not under complete control. As the sensemaking theory of change and

the other socially-constructed perspectives suggest, all that is involved in change will

also bring about change through their social processes of interaction and the meanings

they develop as a result (Berger and Luckmann, 1976). Indeed, such a perspective will

shed light on some dialectical distinctions, revealing those that would not be the best

denomination. As for now, change recipients might be better denominated change

participants, due to the active, and not passive, role they play in change (Balogun and

Johnson, 2004). As discussed further in this literature review, this “redenomination” of

roles would also be applied to the resistant to change label.

As an influenced but not controlled process, somehow sensemaking can

generate disparate senses in comparison to what was expected from change leaders. If

sensemaking occurs in the direction expected, or if comes up with an unexpected

response, this is essential information that needs to be monitored by change leaders.

Responsiveness to change, or resistance to change as it has been usually called, has

also been a deeply studied aspect of organizational change that will be advanced in the

following section in both conceptual and operational dimensions.
