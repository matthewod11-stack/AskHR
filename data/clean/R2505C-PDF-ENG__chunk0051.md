## yourself with not just cheerleaders but also constructive critics who

will honestly assess how you’re doing. When you allow others to judge

your choices and point out contradictory signals, you’ll have more

conﬁdence in your ultimate course of action. So ﬁnd people willing to

discuss and then validate or challenge your narratives, interpretations,

and competencies. Knudstorp, for example, emphasized the importance

of candid customer feedback at Lego; one of his slogans was “Listen

to the complainer.” Likewise, GE’s Culp is known for taking and

encouraging “gemba walks,” a practice in which managers go to the

factory ﬂoor to hear directly from frontline employees.
