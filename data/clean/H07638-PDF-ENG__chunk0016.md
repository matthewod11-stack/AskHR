# regularly, especially as a group.

Think about your future.

While it’s easy to get completely wrapped up in the teams’ development

and how you will help them perform better, you must also think

about yourself. Your manager may only care about you achieving a

successful turnaround. To keep moving forward in your career, co-

create individual goals with your manager. Your renewed focus on your

own performance can only help the team. Carve out 30 minutes a week

and keep a standing meeting with your manager so you can have the

space to think about your goals moving forward.

It’s frustrating and challenging when your team is underperforming,

especially if you’ve been coaching and pushing them to meet their

goals. Trust that you can handle the responsibility of turning things

around. Examine your leadership style, overcommunicate, and work

toward collaborative solutions with your team members; remember that

you’re not alone. Make sure you’re focusing on your goals, too.
