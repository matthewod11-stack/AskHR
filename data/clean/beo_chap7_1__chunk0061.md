than younger college students on general knowledge questions, which suggests that

age teaches people what they know (see Kovalchik et al. 2005). And depressed

people are typically not overconfident (“wiser but sadder”), which suggests over-

confidence is part of mental health, and probably evolutionarily adaptive (see, for

example, Taylor and Brown 1988). Overconfidence depends also on the type of task

and its framing. For example, overconfidence about a particular estimate shrivels up

when a portfolio of estimates are considered (see Kahneman and Lovallo (1993) on

the single-case “inside view” compared to the portfolio “outside view”). Consider

the 90%-confidence interval] task, where subjects are instructed to give a wide inter-

val for each numerical quantity which is only wrong 10% of the time; typically, five

out of ten intervals are too narrow. Subjects typically give too narrow intervals. But

when subjects are asked how many out of ten questions they got right, they typically

do not say “one out of ten,” they say “five out of ten”--which is empirically accurate

(Sniezek and Buckley 1992). Overconfidence also shrivels up when the question is

posed more narrowly, breaking an outcome into components (Dunning et al. 1989).

While drivers are overconfident about overall driving ability, they are less over-

confident about specific components like driving in snow, avoiding fender-bender

accidents in heavy traffic, and so on. This fact suggests that if the criteria used to

judge managerial success become more vague as people rise in a firm’s hierarchy,

overestimation of future success (and career outcomes) will rise too.
