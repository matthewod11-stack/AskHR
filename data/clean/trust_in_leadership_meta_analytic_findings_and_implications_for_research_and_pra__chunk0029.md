# Identification of Studies

We used several procedures to ensure that we had included existing studies. First, we searched several electronic indexes using the keyword trust: PsycINFO (1967–2000), SocioFile (1974–2000), ABI/Inform (1985–2000), and Dissertation Abstracts (1861–1999). The search identi- fied over 15,500 studies that were reviewed for consideration (there was some redundancy between databases). Second, we examined the reference sections of books and articles that provided a narrative review of the trust literature (e.g., Dirks & Ferrin, 2001; Kramer, 1999; McCauley & Kuhnert, 1992) or other literatures that might include trust. Third, we manually searched for studies in the following journals from 1980 to the present: Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Group and Organization Management, Journal of Applied Psychology,

Referents and definition of trust. The studies were coded for the two moderator variables: referent and definition. Referent was coded into two categories: direct leader (e.g., supervisor, work group leader) and organi- zational leadership (e.g., executive leadership, collective set of leaders). To determine which category a study fit, we examined the items it used to measure trust.

Definition was coded into four categories: affective trust, cognitive trust, willingness to be vulnerable, and overall trust. The items in each scale were examined and coded according to the definitions reported in the Appendix. A number of studies used an existing measure without reporting the items; in those cases we referred to the original source. To be coded as one of the specific definitions (affective, cognitive, or willingness), at least 75% of the items in a scale had to represent a single dimension. If less than 75% of the items represented a single dimension, the scale was classified as
