# physical experience as well as online.

A lot of our customers like to shop through multiple diﬀerent channels.

In some cases they’d like to have center of store picked for them and

ready for them to pick it up when they shop the store, and then look

at our perimeter, whether it’s picking out their own meat or seafood or

interacting with our team members. As an example, at our cheese case,

a certiﬁed cheese professional can help choose exactly the right cheeses

as you’re putting together your cheeseboard and charcuterie plates.

How do you think the in-store experience will change for Whole Foods
