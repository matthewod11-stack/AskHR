# Recommendations

Several recommendations for senior human resource and labor relations executives emerge from this review and synthesis of research on unionized grievance procedures. First, it is important for senior executives to conceptu- alize the grievance procedure as one among

several high-involvement-type human resource practices. This is because such practices have been empirically shown to positively affect organizational performance, and because a grievance procedure serves as a due process mechanism for employees which theoretically has been shown to be a critical element in a high performance work system.

Second, senior human resource and la- bor relations executives should understand the distinction between the presence and use of a grievance procedure. Such a procedure pro- vides a formal avenue for employee voice and is thus available for resolving work place and organizational conflicts. If the grievance pro- cedure is used too much, however—if griev- ance filing rates are very high—it suggests the absence of effective informal conflict resolu- tion and also displaces management and em- ployee work time, thereby detracting from organizational performance. Hence, manage- ment must carefully monitor the grievance procedure to determine if the procedure is being under- or over-used.

Third, senior human resource and labor re- lations executives should analyze grievance pro- cedure usage data to determine if grievants and their supervisors have lower job performance, promotions and work attendance, and higher turnover than non-grievants and their supervi- sors after grievance settlement. If this is occur- ring, then management must determine if management reprisal is taking place or, instead, if grievants and their supervisors are in fact poorer performers than non-grievants and their supervisors, as revealed through grievance ac- tivity. Where management reprisal for filing griev- ances is found to exist, management must take corrective action to ensure that the organiza- tional performance and due process objectives of the grievance procedure are achieved rather than undermined.

Fourth, because supervisor behavior and attitudes are important determinants of griev- ance activity, senior human resource and la- bor relations executives should periodically assess the extent to which supervisors deal with employees democratically (in research terminology, exercise “consideration”) as well as the extent to which supervisors empha- size getting the job done (in research termi- nology, “initiating structure”).
