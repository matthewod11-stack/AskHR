employee productivity was impacted by performance reviews in the Nigerian context was conducted in by Hangeior, Oravee, and Zayum.

The study's conclusions showed that management by objectives and regular feedback increased staff productivity in an organisation. In a study conducted by Omusebe,Kimanichege, and Musiega to evaluate how employee evaluation methods affected their productivity, the findings showed that performance reviews had a direct and significant impact on workers' productivity. The studies mentioned above demonstrate that while there have been several investigations on the impact of performance reviews on worker output, none have been conducted in Kenya's water industry. There haven't been many studies on the relationship between employee productivity and appraisal criteria and feedback. By investigating the impact of performance appraisal comments on employee productivity in water and sewage enterprises within Kiambu County, Kenya, this study aimed to close this information gap[5], [6].
