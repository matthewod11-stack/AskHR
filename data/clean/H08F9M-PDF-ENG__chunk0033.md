## relationships of care, trust, high standards and accountability that

leaders help people thrive.

We capture the heart of leadership with a framework we call LIVE. The

acronym represents four drivers that help people engage and thrive –

love, inspiration, vitality and expression. The framework gives leaders a

way to connect the work people do every day to their deeper needs. And

it really is about the heart — about caring for people, getting to know

them (love); about inspiring them with a vision of a better future and

of their own potential (inspiration); about establishing energy-creating

patterns in their lives (vitality); about giving people voice and room

to create (expression). LIVE is a tool for unleashing the power and

potential that is already in people and making the heart of leadership
