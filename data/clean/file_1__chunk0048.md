of working and family life. Generally speaking, the Amended Act of 1995 obliged workplaces to systematically promote gender equality.

In 1995, Finland joined the European Union (EU), which has an important role in promoting gender equality policies across Europe through the process known as ‘Europeanization’. The EU strives to reduce gender inequality by fighting against discrimination and promoting diversity. Nevertheless, the gap between the goals and the reality is one of the topics commonly discussed among Nordic gender scholars (Borchorst, 2006; Borchorst and Siim, 2002b).

Different meanings of the concept of gender equality prevail across the European countries. The Nordic countries, including Finland, have been considered by some scholars as a paradise for women (e.g., Fougner and Asp-Larse, 1994). Its ‘passion for gender equality’ is frequently marked as an essential feature of these countries (Borchorst and Siim, 2002a; Holli, Magnusson and Rönnblom, 2005). These countries demonstrate the highest rates of women in government and policy-making positions, which help them to promote gender awareness in many public arenas. Women’s full-time employment is both practically and ideologically accepted in these countries (Rantalaiho, 1997). The Nordic countries also rank highly in terms of the work-life balance through the means of welfare state benefits to all parents and children.

Gender equality is promoted by implementation of various strategies and policies in the Nordic countries. The main strategy involves enhancing equality through legislation. Gender equality is also supported in the Nordic countries by attempting to equalize the gender division of labour, by managing day-care for children, parental leave, and care for elderly people (Heiskanen and Räsänen, 1997). Anti-discrimination legislation has also been implemented. In general, all these social policy strategies have enhanced the position of women in the Nordic countries.

Although the Nordic countries have come the furthest in achieving gender equality, Lindvert (2002) stated that gender equality has signified equality for mainly white working mothers in these countries. Other scholars have argued that although the position of women has improved in the Nordic countries, gender inequality still persists and emerges in new forms even when social policy strategies are implemented to reduce it (Acker, 1997). For the women living in the Nordic countries, equality seems like a mirage. Instead of the image of equal societies, the gender pay gap, the gendered segregation in work and education, the hierarchical difference of the valued masculine and devalued feminine as well as sexual harassment still exist there (Rantalaiho, Heiskanen and Korvajärvi, 1997).

As we can see, the research in the area of the achievement of gender equality in the Nordic countries has become more nuanced and critical. On the one hand, there is literature which describes these countries as ‘women-friendly’ societies (Borchorst and Siim, 2008; Hernes, 1987; Holli et al., 2005). On the other hand, there are researchers who claim that gender equality in these countries has not yet been achieved (Lindvert, 2002; Rantalaiho et al., 1997).
