# Encourage Group Sharing During Meetings

In a large team meeting, there won’t be much space for personal

catchups. But if you have a smaller team, it may be appropriate to

take some time on a weekly or monthly basis for updates. This could

be as simple as a quick share at the beginning of a meeting about a
