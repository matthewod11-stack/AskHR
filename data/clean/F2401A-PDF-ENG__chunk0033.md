## HBR / Magazine Article / Lessons from Large Family Firms About Choosing a CEO

imponderables. Take Anish Shah, who succeeded me as group head in

- 2021. He joined us in 2014. I brought him in then, with no guarantees

about succession, because I wanted to have a new element to present

to the board when I was ready to step down. I’m also not in favor of a

huge number of prospects; it’s not necessary or even helpful. When we use

headhunters, we ask them to give us two or three names. We’ll do as many

interviews with the headhunter as it takes to learn what we need, but we

don’t want a long list of candidates.

Do you ever consider family members?

Very few have had any interest in joining the business. If one of my

grandsons wanted a role, we’d evaluate him as we would anyone else. If

he didn’t have extraordinary hunger and competence, we’d give him an

office and put him on a board—that’s it. Professional managers helped my

grandfather and great-uncle create the company. My uncle was in charge

next, but he was followed by two nonfamily executives. Professional leaders

have always been in our DNA.

How do you empower new CEOs?

My uncle gave me an enormous amount of space, and I made a commitment

to do the same. I said to Anish, “You have a clean sheet. Nothing is

off-limits; if you don’t like a program I created, kill it.” I don’t push for

involvement; he pulls on my time when he wants it. A friend once told me,

“Be a well; let people come to you for water when they need it. Don’t be

a brook, bubbling into everybody’s business.” As long as new leaders are

adding value, they have the freedom to decide how they want to do things.
