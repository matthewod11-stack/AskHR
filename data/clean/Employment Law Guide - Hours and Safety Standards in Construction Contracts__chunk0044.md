## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

The provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA) may also apply to Davis- Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) contracts where the contract is Ô¨Ånanced in whole or in part by grants or loans

from the U.S. Government, or loans insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, except where the federal

assistance is only in the nature of a loan guarantee or insurance. The overtime requirements of the Fair Labor

Standards Act (FLSA) frequently also apply to Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) contracts. In addition to

these federal labor standards, state overtime pay requirements may apply.
