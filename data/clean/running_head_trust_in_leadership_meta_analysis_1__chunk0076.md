# individualised consideration aspect of transformational leadership, although many studies

choose to collapse this into an aggregated measure of overall transformational leadership

(e.g., Phong et al., 2018). Similarly, empowering leadership is a signal of significant

investment in the relationship and the development of the follower, potentially at the expense

of the leader. In contrast, McAllisterâ€™s (1995) description of cognitive trust as being grounded

in perceptions of reliability, competence and dependability makes it likely to be influenced by

leadership styles that are focused on signalling the characteristics of the leader as competent

and full of integrity. For this reason, it may be the case that styles such as authentic, ethical,

transactional and transformational leadership will be influential in driving rational, cognitive

judgements about a willingness to be vulnerable to the leader.

As noted, making specific predictions about the styles in relation to the bases of trust

is hard due to the overlap between them on the dimensional level and the lack of studies

focusing on these separate dimensions in relation to trust. Indeed, failure to explore

differential effects for dimensions of a given style constitutes a considerable critique of the

leadership literature overall (Banks et al., 2016; Hughes et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020; van

Knippenberg & Sitkin, 2013). Most leadership studies aggregate measures of leadership to

form an overall score (i.e., of overall servant leadership). However, if the conceptual core of

the different styles is sufficiently different despite the dimensional overlap, this may still

shine through in differential relationships with the two forms of trust. Our meta-analysis

serves to provide initial evidence to identify which leaderships styles are associated more

strongly with different bases of trust, thus providing support for their differing nomological

networks. In line with this, we hypothesise:

Hypothesis 2: Different leadership styles will have differential relationships with
