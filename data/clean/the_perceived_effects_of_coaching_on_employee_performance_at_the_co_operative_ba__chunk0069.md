## 2.2.2(cid:32) Cognitive Behavioral Theory

Cognitive Behavioral Theory (CBT) integrates behavioral theory with cognitive

theory. Behavior theory argues that learning occurs through an observable

association between a stimulus and a response. BF Skinner, described reinforced or

operant conditioning, which is the process of behavior modification when the

behavior is a result of a consequence. Cognitive theory describes the importance of

the thinking and choice in determining behaviors including our perception of the

meaning of events. Cognitive theory was pioneered by Albert Ellis, who

subsequently developed Rational Emotive Ellis created the ABC theory of

personality, which is the concept of an antecedent or an activating (A) event, a

behavior (B) that occurs from that event, and finally the consequence (C) of that

event Ducharme (2004). If you can understand your thoughts about the event, then

you can change your behaviors and therefore the consequences that come about due

to your future behaviors. As aspiring coaches, we can question our clients about

their beliefs about an event so they may become aware of irrational thoughts that

could be contributory factors to engaging in unhelpful behaviors.

CBT and its approaches to therapy have been widely adopted in the coaching field

wherein clients are encouraged to identify and re-evaluate self-defeating thoughts

and engage in more effective ways of thinking, and therefore behaving (McMahon,

2007). Coaching in this area is more issue focused and examines a specific event

and developmental need of the client (Ducharme, 2004). Once the critical activating

event or situation that is causing the clientâ€™s distress has been identified, it is

important to use cognitive restructuring to replace negative or maladaptive thoughts

with positive ones. Another key aspect of CBT is the assignment to the client of

homework that will keep them engaged and encourages ownership of the process.

CBT can induce demonstrable behavior change through objective-setting and

homework that must be completed by the client through self-observation, self-
