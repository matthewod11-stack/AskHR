# and your kids.

So how do you actually go about taking the time you need?

First, assess if you’re well enough to work productively at home.

Sometimes canceling meetings and video calls, so you can email, work

on spreadsheets, or cold-call in your pajamas for a day will get you

where you need to be. That said, don’t do this if your physical or mental

state means you’re going to do work that’s subpar. If you do, you’ll have

to do it over again when you’re feeling better. (As someone who has had

to apologize for emails sent in the haze of the ﬂu, trust me on this one.)

If you do call in sick, be direct. You don’t have to be elaborate about

your reason: “I’m not feeling well enough to work today, so I’m taking

a sick day. I’ll be back on the job tomorrow if I’m feeling better.” Some

organizations or managers may push back on this, but you don’t owe

them details about your health. If you’ve determined that you’re not

well enough to work, stay ﬁrm. Remember, this is your time and your
