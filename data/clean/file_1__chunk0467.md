Gender awareness programmes should continue to aim at acknowledging both employers and employees that the gender pay gap is an issue which concerns each of them and each of them is responsible for solving the problem. One of the suggestions of raising awareness about the gender pay gap is to include members of the oppressed groups in the blueprint of educational programmes. Such collaboration may lead to the engagement of the experiential knowledge of the gender pay gap and professional skills (Baker, Lynch, Cantillon and Walsh, 2004). Moreover, the suggestion is to include a gender lesson in compulsory curriculum of schools and universities in order to discuss and be aware of gender issues. Additionally, more efforts should be made by the media to discuss the concept of the gender pay gap and make women more aware of their rights and opportunities.

Overall, although equal pay programmes and policies have opened up the avenue for many women, many steps have to be pushed forward by letting every organizational and societal member to be aware of gender pay inequalities and by forcing every participant to realise his/her rights and opportunities. However, it is obvious that pay laws are not in themselves sufficient to close the gender pay gap. Increasing general awareness about gender pay inequalities may change peoples’ behaviour patterns which can lead to the pay gap. Increasing public awareness of gender pay inequalities may, in turn, change peoples’ cultural expectations of the male breadwinner role and the corresponding “family wage”, which have an impact on individuals’ perceptions of the gender pay gap.

Many individuals come to organizations with lots of motivations, expectations and contributions and some of them continue to perceive organizations as an equal arena for development and promotion. They consistently assert that there are no gender pay differences within their organizations due to a widespread perception that the gender pay gap no longer exists. Many of them are devastated afterwards when this assumption is shown to be false in practice since most of the organizations continue to be full of barriers, which are constituted by certain sections of society that continue to enjoy power and gender pay inequality.
