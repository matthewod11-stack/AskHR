# Limitations and future directions

Regardless of the growing literature concerning the gender pay gap, there is a limited research on whether and to what extent individuals perceive the phenomenon. This paper broadens the domain of gender pay gap research by developing a conceptual framework, which describes concrete factors that facilitate individuals’ perceptions of the gender pay gap.

Despite its contribution, the paper has a number of limitations, which may provide indications for future directions of the research. First of all, it might be suggested that propositions cannot be sufficiently generalized to all societies. The perceived gender pay gap can have different meanings in various cultures due to differences in gender roles. An extensive empirical study that explores perceptions of individuals from various countries is thus needed to confirm present propositions. An example of such kind of a study could be a comparative research based on the surveys conducted by United Nations Economic Commission for Europe or by European Commission.
