## but also by “noise”—factors unrelated and irrelevant to the decision

being made. A noise audit helps them measure the eﬀects of those

factors. It involves presenting multiple decision-makers with a set of

similar hypothetical situations and asking them to predict outcomes.

For instance, you might ask a group of judges to predict the sentences

for a set of similar criminal convictions. The objective is to assess how

the predicted sentences of each judge vary across cases as well as how

they vary across the group of judges as a whole. Typically, the noise

level is the standard deviation of predictions across cases and across the

predictors. If it’s high, then the judges need to revisit how they make

sentencing decisions. The tool can be applied to help project managers

identify whether they’re likely to be swayed by irrelevant factors in

making key decisions in, say, purchasing services or hiring.
