# Training

“in, through, and for” the workplace within a range of traditional and new learning spaces. The achievement of human agency through environments is another area of research that could be further addressed, specifically by exploring different configurations of the learning space both at the workplace and beyond. The changing nature of workplace competences and the ways individuals acquire and use such competences in different learning spaces provide a basis for an emerging discussion of new types of work-related spaces. Future research can draw upon rich sources of workplace learning theories and approaches in order to expand our knowledge and understanding of the interrelationships between workplaces and individuals in the modern globalized world.

One aspect that should be not overlooked by further research on workplace learning is the international dimension in researching workplace learning. Workplace learning studies in a globalized world are increasingly drawing on the diversity of policies and practices in an international perspective. Chisholm et al. (2012), for example, have shown how trans- national explorations of Asian and European research approaches and workplace practices contribute to a better understanding of the notion of learning at work in a compara- tive perspective and provide an insight into the interrelationships between research and practice. Future approaches to researching work and learning need to take into account a significant challenge of advancing our understanding and conceptualizing the notion of workplace learning internationally. Through a dialogic approach, diverse traditions in researching learning at work (Sawchuk, 2011) can move beyond existing silos to advance theoretical understanding and enhance practice.
