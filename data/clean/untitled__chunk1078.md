# The “Culture of Personality”

Personality . . . is by far the greatest word in the history of the human mind. . . . [It ] is the key that unlocks the deeper myster- ies of Science and Philosophy, of History and Literature, of Art and Religion, of all man’s Ethical and Social relationships. (Randall, 1912, pp. xiii–xiv)

Cultural historians suggest that during the early decades of the twentieth century, societal changes associated with indus- trialization, urbanization, and mass education evoked among Americans “a strong sense of the urgency of ﬁnding one’s self” (Burnham, 1968b, p. 367; see also Thornton, 1996). During the “turn-of-the-century decade,” according to Susman (1979), “interest grew in personality, individual idiosyncrasies, per- sonal needs and interests. . . . There was fascination with the very peculiarities of the self, especially the sick self” (pp. 216–217). The popular press featured dramatic de- scriptions of cases of psychopathology, such as the Ladies’ Home Journal article entitled “How One Girl Lived Four Lives: The Astounding Case of Miss Beauchamp” (Corbin, 1908), a popularized version of Morton Prince’s (1906) fa- mous case of “dissociated personality.” Seeking to relieve fears of depersonalization, Americans consulted self-improve- ment manuals that emphasized the cultivation of a unique, fas- cinating “personality”—a term that “became an important part of the American vocabulary” (Susman, 1979, p. 217). This new emphasis on “personality” is evident in the previous quote from John Randall. Randall represented the New Thought, or Mind Cure, movement, which was important in the transition from a “culture of character,” a nineteenth- century ideal emphasizing duty and moral qualities, to a “cul- ture of personality” (Susman, 1979, p. 216), emphasizing self-development and self-presentation.
