# Procrastination

The easiest excuse to avoid starting a reinvention process as an

executive is all the other urgent work you have to do. Successful leaders

are rewarded with ever-greater responsibilities, which means that they

have less and less time to focus on their own longer-term aspirations.

That limited bandwidth can also fuel anxiety: It can be hard to imagine

a nebulous future when weighed down with the very real demands of

today. More than this, personal reinvention can be scary. Who among

us hasn’t hesitated in the face of a big decision, not for more insight,

but simply in the hope of deferring choices to avoid the associated

anxiety and self-doubt? We also know from psychology that people

procrastinate to avoid ambiguous, diﬃcult and unstructured situations

or decisions — and personal reinvention checks all of these boxes.
