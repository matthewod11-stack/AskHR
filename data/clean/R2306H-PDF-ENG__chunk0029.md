## technology leaders from some of the largest U.S. science-based

corporations regularly get together in what are commonly known as

industry peer networks. In these groups members share knowledge

about common issues such as emerging technology trends and the

implications for technology strategy. During one of the peer network

gatherings we attended, we saw members engaging in an intense

debate about the conference theme—the merits of open innovation—

and realized that the changes implemented in one ﬁrm could help

catalyze changes in others. For example, the ﬁrm had redesigned its

intellectual property function so that it no longer solely prioritized the

protection of IP rights but also enabled safe collaboration, a model the

other ﬁrms could follow.
