## HBR / Digital Article / How to Get Better at Delegating

Guide, listen, and ask for feedback

Think of yourself as both a coach and a cheerleader, says Kerpen.

“A coach’s job is to get the most out of their people,” he explains.

You’re not there to ensure everything is done perfectly or exactly as you would; your role is to inspire and guide. Oﬀer your experience

and provide context. “Help your team see how their work ﬁts into the

whole,” says Morgan. “Why does it matter?” Encourage your team to ask questions and oﬀer feedback to you, too. Without ongoing and open communication, “delegating can go oﬀ the rails.”

Remember: progress not perfection Eﬀective delegation is about “empowering your team, coaching them

to success, and giving them the tools they need to succeed while

championing them along the way,” says Kerpen. The best part is that

you’ll have more time, energy, and space to focus on what matters to

you, both at work and in your personal life. That said, be realistic:

delegation isn’t a cure-all. There’s still work to be done. “Accounting

for that in your brain and your calendar is key,” says Morgan. “Even if

someone completes a task 80% as well as you would, or only gets part

way through it, that’s a win.” After all, “We’re not going for perfection.

We’re going for progress, and delegation is the tool to get there.”
