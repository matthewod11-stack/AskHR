# Conﬂuence of Dynamic Forces

For the past two decades and for the next century, the external environment for organizations has been and will be turbulent because of globalization, increased competition, and rapid change. To survive, ﬂexible organizations’ re- sponses include restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing (e.g., elimination of management positions in order to reduce size and costs), and new product lines. To be competitive, strategies for managing change and for creating a committed and satisﬁed workforce will need to be devel- oped and implemented. Cascio (1995) suggested that training and development will emerge as the essential activity for companies in the twenty-ﬁrst century. As they did at the be- ginning of I-O psychology, I-O psychologists will continue to respond to business needs. Some senior SIOP members re- cently expressed concerns that top management issues and business demands (e.g., strategic planning, ﬁnancial incen- tives) rather than the pursuit of science will drive the work of I-O psychologists (Locke, 2000).
