Whether or not you hire an outside negotiator, you’ll need an internal

negotiating team staﬀed with managers from a variety of departments

who understand your approach and share your goals. Your toughest

discussions may not be with the union team across the table but within

your own team, so do everything you can to ﬁnd and empower internal

allies. Even if your company had a hostile posture toward unions in the

past, you will ﬁnd people eager to turn over a new leaf and collaborate.
