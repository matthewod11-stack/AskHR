## incident rate of 0.02 per 200,000 work hours in 2022.

When adopting safety as a strategic goal, however, managers should

avoid making it a stand-alone initiative. Doing so will only serve to

divorce it from the core business strategy. In our experience, when

safety is treated as a separate initiative, it quickly becomes an exercise

in cost reduction and compliance. Employees see it as an additional

burden, not an integral part of their job or the company’s strategy, and

resources are cut at the ﬁrst sign of ﬁnancial pressure.
