- (cid:32) Making some federal spending (e.g., grants to develop the workforce or to improve the public health) conditional on showing that the funds will be used to enforce and support ADA standards. This should be guaranteed by a stronger system of federal oversight that will make states improve disability rights and offer the required infrastructure to guarantee that they are actually enforced. 7.2 Expanding ADA Training and Public Awareness Campaigns Widespread lack of understanding of the law among employers, HR professionals and even people with disabilities is one of the most significant obstacles to successful complying with ADA.

practice, healthcare, and education. The increased awareness among the stakeholders will encourage them to adopt a voluntary compliance and allay the fear of being penalized under the law and more accommodating workplace culture. 7.3 Investing in Disability Inclusion Metrics and Auditing Governments have to measure what matter to keep track of progress. Compared with proactive measures, the current ADA compliance evaluation is based more often on complaints. Future oriented policy must consist of (Lopez, 2025):

- (cid:32) Designing and putting measures on disability inclusion to evaluate the quality of workplace accommodating and retaining disabled employees.

- (cid:32) Rewarding both the private and state or municipal employers to make their accessibility reporting transparent as ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) reporting.

- (cid:32) Developing the audit tools that are prone to accessibility whereby organizations can assess themselves on content and make their compliance or non-conformance known. Transforming reactive enforcement to proactive inclusion will go a long way in realising disability rights as part of organizational policies and practices. 7.4 Encouraging Inclusive Hiring Practices and Innovation An inclusive hiring is the first step to equal access to work. Governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and corporations will have to collaborate, to (Castro et al., 2024):

- (cid:32) Use advertisement: user-friendly job boards, interview with an ASL interpreter, and an assessment accessible to neurodiverse individuals.

- (cid:32) Fund inclusive hiring pilot projects, particularly at manufacturing, agriculture, and tech which are underrepresented industries.
