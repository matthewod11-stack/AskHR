# new techniques:

Look for outcomes. Excellence is an outcome, so take note of when a

prospect leans into a sales pitch, a project runs smoothly, or an angry

customer suddenly calms down. Then turn to the team member who

created the outcome and say, “That! Yes, that!” By doing this, you’ll stop

the ﬂow of work for a moment and pull your colleague’s attention back

toward something she just did that really worked.

There’s a story about how legendary Dallas Cowboys coach Tom

Landry turned around his struggling team. While the other teams were

reviewing missed tackles and dropped balls, Landry instead combed

through footage of previous games and created for each player a

highlight reel of when he had done something easily, naturally, and

eﬀectively. Landry reasoned that while the number of wrong ways to

do something was inﬁnite, the number of right ways, for any particular

player, was not. It was knowable, and the best way to discover it was to

look at plays where that person had done it excellently. From now on, he

told each team member, “we only replay your winning plays.”

Now on one level he was doing this to make his team members feel

better about themselves because he knew the power of praise. But

according to the story, Landry wasn’t nearly as interested in praise as he

was in learning. His instincts told him that each person would improve

his performance most if he could see, in slow motion, what his own

personal version of excellence looked like.
