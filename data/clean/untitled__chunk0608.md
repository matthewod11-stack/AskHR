Figure 5.2 Instances of noncorrespondence and illusion: (A) the upper di- vided space appears to be slightly longer than the lower undivided space (the ﬁlled space-open space illusion); (B) the black circle surrounded by large circles appears smaller than the black circle surrounded by small circles (the Ebbinghaus illusion); (C) the vertical line appears longer than the horizontal line (the horizontal-vertical illusion).

items could be distorted in certain environments. For exam- ple, Smith (1738) noted that “Animals and small objects seen in valleys, contiguous to large mountains, appear extraordi- narily small” (p. 314). For some reason, such descriptions simply do not create the same impact as a simple graphic dis- play, such as Figure 5.2B, where the two black circles (which are simply surrogates for two animals) are the same size, yet the circle surrounded by large forms (which are mere the graphic analogues of mountains) seems to be somewhat smaller than its counterpart, which is surrounded by only small items.

It may well have been that having such portable demon- strations of the failure of vision to accurately represent real- ity generated more interest because more people could so readily and reliably see the effects. Perhaps these line ﬁgures appealed to the rising interest in experimentation. The juxta- position of environmental elements that might cause illusions to appear (such as mountains or moons) cannot be arranged and rearranged at will. The major advantage of lines drawn on paper lies in their ﬂexibility. To begin with, one can easily manipulate the array by bringing large and small objects in close proximity to one another in the picture plane. One can also select stimuli, such as circles, squares, or lines, that have no necessary and familiar size. One can manipulate stimulus elements along many dimensions, such as brightness, chro- maticity, spatial proximity, identity, and so forth. Further- more, one can verify the true dimensions of the perceptually distorted ﬁgural elements with tools as simple as a ruler.

With the opportunities for easy experimentation so readily available, perhaps it is not surprising that between 1855,
