## that ultimately hurt women — and their employers. Primary-caregiver

policies pressure couples into breadwinner/homemaker roles instead of

diving childcare responsibilities equally — the exact opposite of what

employers should be doing to decrease attrition.

Paid leave is a powerful tool for recruiting and retaining top talent

— if it sends a strong signal that a company values its employees

and is committed to equity and diversity in the workplace. Employers

can avoid undercutting this powerful message by making sure that

their paid leave policy applies equally to all new parents — mothers

and fathers, biological and adoptive, LGBT, salaried and hourly —

without requiring that employees ﬁrst prove themselves to be primary

caregivers. Many companies are ditching primary-caregiver policies in

favor of gender-neutral policies and are expanding paid leave beneﬁts

to hourly workers, and for good reason: When you enter the paid-leave

arms race, you want to win it.
