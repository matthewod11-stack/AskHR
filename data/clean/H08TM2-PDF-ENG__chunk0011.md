# Don’t delegate—dig in.

When faced with a business challenge, executive leaders are commonly

advised to delegate. However, a turnaround demands that leaders dive

in, apply their experience and judgement, and restore conﬁdence so

that what they eventually delegate is aligned with where they need to

go.

John*, a newly promoted bank COO who one of us (Jordan) coached,

was astounded at how much was broken in the organization he

inherited. With the clock ticking to ﬁx major problems, it was clear

that his 30,000-foot leadership style was not going to work. Instead,

he took the reins and interviewed people deep into the organization to

understand core bottlenecks and operational issues. As a result, he let

several leaders go and tightly managed hiring and retention until he saw

evidence that critical issues were repaired. After that, he shifted back to

a strategic leadership style and built a team that could execute the work

in the newly improved frameworks.
