# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

DEB LIU:

Recently, I went to a CEO conference, and there were over 200 CEOs

there. In that room, I was the only woman of color, and it was probably

less than 10% women. I stopped for a second, and I thought about it

and I said, “You know what? I could think about it as I’m an imposter.

I don’t belong here. Or I can think of myself as, ‘I’m the ﬁrst person

that looks like me in this room, and that means that next year, there’ll

be two, three, four, or ﬁve, and that it will change, and over time, we

will change this together’.” So, I have always taken this idea of imposter

syndrome because everyone feels that, men and women, there’s been a

lot of studies to say that, but the bigger thing is what do you do about it?

Do you let it cow you? Do you let it put you inside of yourself? Or do

you actually say, “You know what? I’m going to take that energy and I’m

going to use it as fuel to get to where I want to go,” which is, I might feel

like an imposter, but I’m going to turn it on its head. One idea of turning

on its head and how I do it is I say, “You know what? I might not be the

expert at X and I might not be as smart, I might not look like anyone

else, but I bring something really special to the table. I’m going to learn

faster, I’m going to try harder than other people.” And that has given me

the ability to overcome that when the time comes.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Another truism that people casually throw out there is this idea of the

“Queen Bee syndrome”, that women who have made it to the top hold

onto it so tightly that they actually are not encouraging other women.

Instead of being a role model, and a sponsor, and a helpful hand,

they actually prevent other women from rising similarly. Is that a real

phenomenon or is that an incorrect perception?
