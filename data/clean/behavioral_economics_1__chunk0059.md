Results consistent with behavioral economics: Other neural evidence is already vaguely consistent

with behavioral economics ideas like those in Table 1. McClure et al (2004) find evidence of two systems

involved in time discounting, consistent with a quasi-hyperbolic β-δ theory. Sanfey et al (2003) find that low

offers in ultimatum games (compared to near-equal offers) differentially activate emotional areas (insula),

planning and evaluation areas (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) and conflict resolution areas (anterior

cingulate). Relative activity in the insula and DLPFC predicts whether offers will be rejected or not. This result

is consistent with social preferences models in which money and distaste for unfairness or inequality are traded

off (by the cingulate). Hsu et al (2005) compared decisions under ambiguity and risk (using Ellsberg-paradox

examples). Ambiguity differentially activates the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, just above the eye sockets) and the

amygdala, a “vigilance” area which responds rapidly to fearful stimuli and is important in emotional processing

and learning. The fact that OFC activity is stronger and longer-lasting for ambiguous choices implies that

people with damage to the OFC might not exhibit typical patterns of ambiguity-aversion. Indeed, Hsu et al find

that they do not.

New constructs and ideas: The biggest impact of neuroeconomics will probably not come from

adjudicating debates between rational-choice and behavioral economics; it will come from establishing a

detailed empirical basis for constructs which are new in economics (although some of them could be defined in
