# Linking Compensation Design and Outcomes

A good compensation system always begins with an organi­ zation’s strategic goals. When compensation is misaligned with them, trouble ensues. Consider what happened when one company based the bonuses of its CEO and CFO entirely on growing earnings per share—because it assumed that was what investors wanted. As a director explained to us, this incentive encouraged management to make acquisitions with debt, boosting EPS growth but also the company’s risk. Eventually the debt grew too expensive to service, and the company had to put itself up for sale.
