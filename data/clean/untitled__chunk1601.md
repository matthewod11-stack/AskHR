## THE EFFECTS OF INSTRUCTIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 273

The history of educational psychology traces a path from its origins in concerns about cultural improvement and transmis- sion of cultural norms to philosophical issues in general education and psychology (Berliner, 1993; Charles, 1976; Glover & Ronning, 1987; Good & Levin, 2001; Grinder, 1989; Hilgard, 1996; Mayer, 2001; Walberg & Haertel, 1992; Wittrock & Farley, 1989; Zimmerman & Schunk, in press). The effects of this amalgam of antecedent contributions on its birth and development are still evident in the difﬁculties en- countered when attempting a strict deﬁnition of educational psychology that clearly separates it from other psychological disciplines (see Berliner & Calfee, 1996). We will return to this issue later in this chapter.

Although it is not difﬁcult to identify the emergence of educational psychology as a recognized discipline, it is some- what more difﬁcult to determine educational psychology’s precise lineage. It has been suggested that educational psy- chology may have ﬁrst emerged as part of a kind of folk tradition in which adults educated their children (Berliner, 1993). This certainly makes sense intuitively, and it is quite easy to imagine not only our own grandmothers and grandfa- thers teaching our parents a variety of life skills but also parents and grandparents from many previous generations passing down what they considered to be the requisite knowl- edge and cultural norms of their day. It also seems likely that this knowledge was passed down in a dynamic rather than static way, incorporating the abilities, skills, weaknesses, and frames of reference of each generation of teacher and student.
