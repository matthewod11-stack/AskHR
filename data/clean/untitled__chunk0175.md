# 18 Psychology as a Science

theoretical language was inﬂuenced by a philosophy of science of the period.

Continuing concern for the scientiﬁc status of psychology attracted psychologists to an approach to science advocated by Harvard physicist P. W. Bridgman (1927), who made the case for deﬁning unobservable phenomena, such as gravity or hypothesized physical elements such as an electron, in terms of the operations by which their effects on observable events could be measured (Leahey, 2001; Smith, 1986). E. G. Boring’s student, S. S. Stevens (1906–1973), at Harvard in psychology, proposed that psychology adopt a strict opera- tionism (Stevens, 1935a, 1935b, 1939). Only terms that could be deﬁned operationally were scientiﬁcally meaningful; for all practical purposes, only a behavioral psychology could meet this criterion (Leahey, 2001; J. A. Mills, 1998; Smith, 1986).The emphasis on operational deﬁnitions inﬂuenced the language of psychology (Mandler & Kessen, 1959) and the theories of behavior that evolved in the context of opera- tionism and its philosophical forebear, logical positivism, an approach that limited science to observable phenomena.

The neo-behaviorists who shaped what is known as the “Golden Age of Learning Theory” from 1930 to 1950 adopted some ideas from logical positivism and operationism, although each of them was to formulate his own vision of behaviorism (J. A. Mills, 1998; Smith, 1986).
