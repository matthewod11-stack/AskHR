# Be Opportunistic

The most profound negotiation breakthroughs often happen because of

something unexpected—a surprise emotional encounter, unanticipated

common ground, or a crisis that reveals a shared problem. Skilled

mediators learn to watch for emotional turning points, informal

channels, surprising areas of alignment, and other subtle opportunities

that can transform conﬂicts.
