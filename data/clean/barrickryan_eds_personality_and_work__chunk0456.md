# 132 PERSONALITY AND WORK

but rather to search for personality contributions in the mediating processes that are appropriate for the variable in question. Analy- ses driven by this tradition respect the within-person variability across situations but seek to ﬁnd coherence in these dynamic out- come patterns—coherence driven by characteristics of individuals’ processing systems, values, goals, and others that interact with the situation.

It should be clear by now that our position is very much con- sistent with the mediational tradition described by Mischel and Shoda (1995, 1998). Examining the dispositional or stable com- ponent of affective states by correlating personality traits with mean levels of affect aggregated over time or with self-reports of typical affect seems to miss the point of studying affect. “Dispositionaliz- ing” affect removes the essential features of the construct, simply for the purpose of generating associations with other known indi- vidual dispositions. Intraindividual variability, the essential char- acteristic of affective states, is treated as error variance, to be removed in the search for dispositional explanation.

Are we therefore arguing against a role for personality in af- fective processes? Clearly we are not. Instead, we are suggesting that the place to ﬁnd personality effects is in the mediating processes of affect generation. Here we are taking the position of Mischel and Shoda (1995, 1998). Instead of looking for stability in the expression of moods and emotions, we are suggesting that we look for the multiple ways in which personality enters into the causal chain of emotion generation and emotion consequences. Because that chain is deﬁned by the way individuals interact with and understand environmental events and conditions, the position easily accommodates the consistent aspects of human personality with the changing nature of emotional states. We believe that the reconciliation between changing affect states and stable charac- teristics of individuals is to be found by examining how those sta- ble characteristics inﬂuence the various elements of the mediational processes by which events inﬂuence affective reactions and affec- tive reactions inﬂuence behaviors, attitudes, and cognitive pro- cesses of relevance to work settings. We discuss possible inﬂuences of personality after a brief discussion of the emotion-generating process.
