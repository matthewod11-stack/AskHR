Prevent or ease “reentry shock.”

“Reentry shock” refers to the discombobulation you feel when you

transition from a place of calm and equilibrium to one that pulls you into the frazzle and fray. You can prevent this by using buﬀers. Schedule

a free day between your return from vacation and your return to work so

you can mentally and physically prepare for the change in environment.

Keep your calendar light just after your return, which will give you a

chance to reacclimate and avoid overwork. For example, one of our clients has a two-day “no meetings” buﬀer after his return.

Bring some vacation magic home with you.

What exactly was it during your period of recovery that helped you

decompress and feel more like yourself? Was it exercise? Reconnecting

with loved ones? An artistic pursuit or hobby that’s neglected during

the work week? Simply enjoying some unscheduled leisure time? As

much as possible, build these activities and conditions into your normal

weekly routine. Remember, even small doses of downtime make a diﬀerence.

Before saying yes to new requests when you return to work, consider what’s getting in your way of saying no.

Are you concerned about not being recognized, rewarded, or promoted?

If so, stop, breathe, and check your assumptions. It may be possible

to get the recognition and rewards you’re looking for without

overcommitting yourself and sacriﬁcing your health and well-being. If

you can’t identify the problem areas — or if you need help ﬁguring out

what to do about them — consider working with a coach.
