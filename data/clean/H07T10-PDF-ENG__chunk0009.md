# very short dates.

Now let’s consider the typical process of hiring talent. The primary tool

we use to assess talent is a set of job interviews. The typical interview

process is a Q&A format where some version of the common questions

are asked of the candidate: Tell us about your background. Why do

you want to work for us? Share a challenge you faced at work and how

you dealt with it. What are you most proud of? What impact have you

had? Why are you the best person for the job? What is your greatest

achievement? What are your weaknesses?

While much has been said in favor and against the value of interviews

themselves, the typical Q&A job interview process fails to assess one

of the most important, if not the most important, skills you should be

looking for from people you hire — critical thinking. Critical thinking

is seeking information from various sources, assessing its credibility,

and determining its relevance and veracity. Often classiﬁed as a higher-

order skill, critical thinking is not a single skill but a collection of skills

involving reasoning, constructing sound arguments, and identifying

a situation’s ﬂaws, biases, logic, or inconsistencies. Critical thinking is diﬀerent from creative thinking. Creative thinking is the ability to

generate new, innovative ideas. Critical thinking requires the candidate

to carefully and logically analyze facts and form a judgment.
