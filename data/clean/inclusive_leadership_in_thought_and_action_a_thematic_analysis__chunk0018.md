## Inclusive Leadership From a Leadership Perspective

Research on inclusive leadership has also evolved within the leadership literature. Viewed as a particular form of relational leadership, which focuses on the relationship between a leader and follower as the unit of analysis and assumes that the speciﬁc nature of the relationship is socially constructed through their interactions (Uhl-Bien, 2006), inclusive leadership is considered to be driven by the two-way inﬂuence process between leaders and followers. Rather than leaders directing followers, inclusive approaches establish norms of active consultation and participation, which drive shared decision-making within a team or organization (Hollander, 2009). In effect, by inviting and appreciating the contributions of all individuals, this leadership approach helps people feel they are genuinely valued members of the team or orga- nization (Tyler & Lind, 1992). Accordingly, inclusive leadership is con- sidered to be fundamental focuses on to relational interpersonal relationships and drives followers’ perceptions that leaders are fair and accountable and attentive to their needs.
