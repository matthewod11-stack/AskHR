# Why It Happens

The issue lies in how we, as leaders, interpret eﬀort and commitment.

We are trained, often unconsciously, to value visibility and

responsiveness as a proxy for dedication. Employees who respond late

at night or skip vacations are seen as “going the extra mile.” Meanwhile,

those who protect their non-work hours are viewed as less passionate,

less committed, and therefore less promotable, even when they are

equally or more eﬀective on the job. This mindset ignores our own

lay theories and years of supportive research showing that people who

detach from work come back more energized, more productive, and less

likely to burn out.
