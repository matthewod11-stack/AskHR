## HBR / The Big Idea / Survey: How People Experience Chronic Illness at Work

Three-quarters of chronically ill people who took the survey are still working, but many had to make signiﬁcant changes and sacriﬁces to do so.

We asked people with chronic illnesses how their medical conditions

impacted their work. At some point during their illness:

else in your life is…cooking, doing the dishes, taking out the trash,

doing the laundry, etc.” Another noted, “The little things take so much

energy it takes everything out of you, and any personal time is just spent

recovering.”

A quarter of chronically ill respondents had disability accommodations, but many others reported barriers to access.

Twenty-seven percent of chronically ill respondents said that they

had disability accommodations for their medical conditions. The most

common were the ﬂexibility to work from home and ﬂexibility around

working hours (total hours worked, speciﬁc times worked, and the like).

Examples included:

- “Work[ing] from home, accessible training, a special keyboard, extra

days to recover from work travel, [closed] captions.”

- “WFH during ﬂare, virtual option (hybrid), chair for sitting available,
