## HBR / Digital Article / Management By Driving Around

to make things better, they don’t have a suﬃcient grasp of causes and

remedies. In such cases, it’s wise to pause and assess the situation rather

than do something rash and wrong.

All that driving around bought Gordon and his team precious time

to think about, uncover, and develop better solutions. For example,

Gordon and chief digital transformation oﬃcer Ajay Gupta found the

28 minutes the average customer spent at the window to get a Real

I.D. to be unacceptable, but they needed time to ﬁgure out causes and

remedies. Gordon’s oﬃce visits helped him identify unnecessary steps staﬀers at DMV headquarters had added — for example, a requirement

that multiple team members review each application when a review by

a single member was suﬃcient. Gordon, Gupta, and their team also

slowed down to dissect how every step in the Real I.D. registration

process unfolded and could be improved. According to Gordon, they

were able to streamline the process so much because “[they] challenged

every one of those steps,” asking questions like, “Does it come from a

statute? A regulation? A policy? Is it a good idea? Is it a bad idea?”

It built trust with frontline employees.

In his early days at the DMV, Gordon discovered that “the prevailing

culture at the time did not encourage employees to question the status

quo or the wisdom of systems and processes that were negatively

impacting the consumer experience.” Much as John Doyle learned from

Bill Hewlett and David Packard some 60 years ago, Gordon believed that

visiting all those ﬁeld oﬃces would help create trust among frontline

employees — to feel a personal connection with their new boss, and be

seen, heard, and understood, and to feel safer to speak up.

Gordon also found that some DMV leaders at Sacramento headquarters

had never visited ﬁeld oﬃces themselves. So, he began “kicking people

out of the nest.” Gordon was conﬁdent that building face-to-face

relationships with frontline employees would make them more likely
