# Recordkeeping

In the limited instances where EPPA permits the administration of polygraph tests, recordkeeping

requirements apply both to employers and polygraph examiners. Employers and polygraph examiners must

retain required records for a minimum of three years from the date the polygraph examination is conducted (or

from the date the examination is requested if no examination is conducted).
