Published in the same year, Farrell and McDaniel (2001) examined how well general mental ability, perceptual speed, and psychomotor ability predicted job performance at various experience levels in a large cross- sectional sample of employees. They found that the correlation between the various abilities and performance did differ when the model was divided by job consistency. They also found some instances of correlations increasing with experience, decreasing with experience, and ﬂuctuating (decreasing and then increasing again) with experience.

Other studies can be found that also show that there is no deﬁnitive answer to this research question. For example, McEvoy and Beatty (1989) examined the validity of an assessment center over seven years. While the correlations varied (from 0.19 to 0.41 for supervisory ratings of performance), the authors demonstrated that the selection device had validity over an extended period of time. Tziner, Ronen, and Hacohen (1993) also demonstrated the long-term validity of an assessment center. Similarly, Deadrick and Madigan (1990) examined the validity of
