# Brogden-Cronbach-Gleser Utility Formula

Another way to determine the value of a test in a given situation is by comput- ing the amount of money an organization would save if it used the test to select employees. Fortunately, I/O psychologists have devised a fairly simple utility formula to estimate the monetary savings to an organization. To use this formula, five items of information must be known.

. Number of employees hired per year (n). This number is easy to

determine: It is simply the number of employees who are hired for a given position in a year.

. Average tenure (t). This is the average amount of time that employees in the position tend to stay with the company. The number is computed by using information from company records to identify the time that each employee in that position stayed with the company. The number of years of tenure for each employee is then summed and divided by the total number of employees.

. Test validity (r). This figure is the criterion validity coefficient that was

obtained through either a validity study or validity generalization. . Standard deviation of performance in dollars (SDy). For many years, this number was difficult to compute. Research has shown, however, that for jobs in which performance is normally distributed, a good estimate of the difference in performance between an average and a good worker (one standard deviation away in performance) is % of
