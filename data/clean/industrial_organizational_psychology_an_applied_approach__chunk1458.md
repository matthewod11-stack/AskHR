# Lawshe Tables

The Taylor-Russell tables were designed to determine the overall impact of a testing procedure. But we often need to know the probability that a particular applicant will be successful. The Lawshe tables (Lawshe, Bolda, Brune, & Auclair, ) were created to do just that. To use these tables, three pieces of informa- tion are needed. The validity coefficient and the base rate are found in the same way as for the Taylor-Russell tables. The third piece of information needed is the applicant’s test score. More specifically, did the person score in the top %, the next %, the middle %, the next lowest %, or the bottom %?

Once we have all three pieces of information, the Lawshe tables, as shown in Table ., are examined. For our example, we have a base rate of ., a validity of ., and an applicant who scored third highest out of . First, we locate the table with the base rate of .. Then we locate the appropriate category at the top of the chart. Our applicant scored third highest out of  applicants, so she would be in the second category, the next highest one fifth, or %. Using the validity of ., we locate the intersection of the validity row and the test score column and find . This means that the applicant has a % chance of being a successful employee.
