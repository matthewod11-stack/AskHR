## HBR / Digital Article / Agentic AI Is Already Changing the Workforce

taxonomy of AI capabilities that map to your common roles not

only in, say, data validation or call-center functions but also other

roles, including marketing analyst, customer-support rep, scheduling

coordinator, and so on. Language models might excel at drafting

marketing copy, but specialized computer-vision agents might be

best for quality checks in manufacturing. By creating a capabilities

“catalogue,” you can avoid a one-size-ﬁts-all approach. In procurement

terms, this is your RFP for AI solutions. Know which models solve which problems, and partner with staﬃng or technology vendors that can

prove domain expertise. This ensures you’re not paying top dollar for

AI hype that may not match the actual needs of the business.

Integrate your hybrid team.

If you want AI agents and human teams to work well together, you need

crystal-clear role boundaries. So, develop a hybrid-workforce strategy in

which you deﬁne which tasks AI will own, which tasks people will own,

and how the escalation of problems should happen. For example, if an

AI customer-service agent receives a complaint about a complex billing

dispute that concerns an amount above a certain dollar threshold, a

rule might automatically route it to a human specialist. By documenting

roles, protocols, and “hand-oﬀ” points when responsibilities shift in

a workﬂow from one party to another, you build trust across your

organization, preventing conﬂict or duplication.
