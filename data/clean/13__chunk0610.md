Regrettably, stigmas of various types and other factors that are not directly related to the target’s actual job performance may be key determinants of their outcomes in organizations. In addition, in the absence of various types of constraints (e.g., legal restrictions, organizational policies against unfair discrimination) allocators are likely to allocate rewards and punishments to targets on the basis of their degree of stigmatization (Stone-Romero & Stone, 2005).

Interactional Justice. Our SIO model posits that stigmas inﬂuence the nature of interpersonal treatment accorded to targets. For example, because of the effects of similarity on interpersonal attraction observers will be more likely to form friendships with individuals who are similar to them on various dimensions (Byrne, 1971; Riordan, Schaffer, & Stewart, 2005). Note that both social identity theory (Tajfel, 1974, 1978, 1981, 1982a, 1982b; Tajfel & Turner, 1979; Turner, 1982, 1987) and terror management theory (Solomon et al., 1991) support the same prediction. In addition, Graen’s work on leader–member exchange and role making processes (e.g., Graen, 1976; Graen & Scandura, 1987) suggests that the greater the similarity between a supervisor and a subordinate, the more harmonious will be their interpersonal relationship. Consistent with the foregoing, we predict that
