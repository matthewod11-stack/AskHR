# Recruitment and On-boarding

This area of EX was one the worst rated among all questions from author specific

survey. Based on this statistic, company has a significant gap starting with interview

setup. A suggestion is to educate managers and HR personal on how to conduct

interviews to give the potential employee the best feeling about the company culture

and leadership style. Emotions and feelings play a significant role in employee

experience and participants of the recruitment process have to feel comfortable in

order to match their personal values with their potential organization. The onboarding

process also has a gap where analysis shows that employees did not have

opportunities for career progression explained sufficiently. During f2f meetings and

regular personal & development reviews during the onboarding phase, the author

suggests inclusion of employee potential career path discussions and an explanation

of which skills are needed for specific positions.
