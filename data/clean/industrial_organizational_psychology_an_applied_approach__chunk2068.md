# Type of Incentive Used

Obviously, it is important to reward employees for productive work behavior. But, as you learned in the discussion of Maslow’s hierarchy, different employees have different values, which is why supervisors should have access to and be trained to administer different types of reinforcers. For example, some employees can be rewarded with praise, others with awards, others with interesting work, and still others with money. In fact, a meta-analysis by Stajkovic and Luthans () found that financial, nonfinancial, and social rewards all resulted in increased levels of performance. It is important to conduct periodic employee surveys about what employees want because supervisors and employees often have different ideas about what is rewarding and important (Babcock, ).

A good example of the use of a variety of incentives can be found at LaPorte Regional Health System. As part of their award-winning “Caught You Caring” program, LaPorte uses public recognition, gift certificates, small gifts, and a vari- ety of other awards to reward employees who engage in excellent patient care. This use of rewards is one of the reasons that Laporte has a turnover rate of only % in an industry that has an % national turnover rate (Renk, ).

The need for variety in rewards is also true of punishment. Threatening an employee with a three-day suspension will be effective only if he needs the money or doesn’t like being off work; yelling at an employee will be effective only if the employee does not like being yelled at; and threatening to not promote an employee will be effective only if the employee values promotions and perceives he has a reasonable chance of getting one.
