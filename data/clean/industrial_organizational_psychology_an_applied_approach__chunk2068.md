# Contingency of Consequences

If it is not possible to immediately reward or punish a behavior, it should at least be made clear that the employee understands the behaviors that brought reward or punishment. To return to our example of the waiter, if he is told the reason for the size of his tip, he will be better able to change his behavior. Have you ever given a waiter or waitress a large tip even though the service was terrible? Most of us have. When this happens, however, the waiter or waitress is rein- forced for poor performance and has no incentive to improve unless poor per- formance has its own consequence. In a similar fashion, if the waiter has done an outstanding job but has received a small tip, the probability of his repeating his outstanding performance is reduced. Furthermore, when tips are pooled at restaurants so that each employee gets a share of all tips received, an individual employee’s rewards are not as contingent on his own behavior as when tips are not pooled.

The point of these examples is that reward and punishment must be made contingent upon performance, and this contingency of consequence must be clear to employees if we want them to be motivated (Podsakoff, Bommer, Podsakoff, & MacKenzie, ). If the reward or punishment cannot be administered immedi- ately, the employee must be told the purpose of the consequence so that the link between behavior and outcome is clear.
