# Assessment Centers

An assessment center is a selection technique characterized by the use of multiple assessment methods that allow multiple assessors to actually observe applicants per- form simulated job tasks (Joiner, ). Its major advantages are that assessment methods are all job related and multiple trained assessors help to guard against many (but not all) types of selection bias. For a selection technique to be considered an assessment center, it must meet the following requirements (Joiner, ):

The assessment center activities must be based on the results of a thorough job analysis. Multiple assessment techniques must be used, at least one of which must be a simulation. Multiple trained assessors must be used. Behavioral observations must be documented at the time the applicant behavior is observed. Assessors must prepare a report of their observations. The overall judgment of an applicant must be based on a combination of information from the multiple assessors and multiple techniques. The overall evaluation of an applicant cannot be made until all assessment center tasks have been completed.

Development and Component Although many different techniques may be used in assessment centers, the basic development and types of exercises are fairly standard. The first step in creating an assessment center is, of course, to do a job analysis (Caldwell, Thornton, & Gruys, ). From this analysis, exercises are developed that measure different aspects of the job. Common exercises include the in-basket technique, simula- tions, work samples, leaderless group discussions, structured interviews, person- ality and ability tests, and business games. Each of these techniques can be used by itself; but only when several are used in combination do they become part of an assessment center. The typical assessment center has four or five exercises, takes two to three days to complete, and costs about $, per applicant. Once the exercises have been developed, assessors are chosen to rate the applicants going through the assessment center. These assessors typically hold positions two levels higher than the assessees and spend one day being trained (Eurich, Krause, Cigularov, & Thornton, ; Spychalski, Quiñones, Gaugler, & Pohley, ).

The In-Basket Technique. The in-basket technique is designed to simulate the types of daily information that appear on a manager’s or employee’s desk. The tech- nique takes its name from the wire baskets typically seen on office desks. Usually these baskets have two levels: the “in” level, which holds paperwork that must be handled, and the “out” level, which contains completed paperwork.

During the assessment center, examples of job-related paperwork are placed in a basket, and the job applicant is asked to go through the basket and respond to the paperwork as if he were actually on the job. Examples of such paperwork might include a phone message from an employee who cannot get his car started and does not know how to get to work or a memo from the accounting depart- ment stating that an expense voucher is missing.

The applicant is observed by a group of assessors, who score him on several dimensions, such as the quality of the decision, the manner in which the decision was carried out, and the order in which the applicant handled the paperwork— that is, did he start at the top of the pile or did he start with the most important papers? Research on the reliability and validity of the in-basket technique pro- vides only modest support for its usefulness (Schippmann, Prien, & Katz, ).

Simulations. Simulation exercises are the real backbone of the assessment center because they enable assessors to see an applicant “in action.” Simulations, which can include such diverse activities as role plays and work samples, place an appli- cant in a situation that is as similar as possible to one that will be encountered on the job. To be effective, simulations must be based on job-related behaviors and should be reasonably realistic.

A good example of a role-playing simulation is an assessment center used by a large city to select emergency telephone operators. The applicant sits before a switchboard to handle a distressed caller who is describing an emergency situ- ation. The applicant must properly answer the call, calm the caller, and obtain the necessary information in as little time as possible. Other examples include a police applicant writing a traffic citation for an angry citizen, and an applicant for a resident assistant position breaking up an argument between two roommates.

To reduce the high costs associated with actual simulations, many public organizations such as the New York State Civil Service Commission and the City of Fairfax, Virginia, have developed situational exercises on videotape. Organiza- tions using video simulations administer them to a group of applicants, who view the situations in the tape and then write down what they would do in each situa- tion. The written responses are scored by personnel analysts in a fashion similar to that used with situational interviews. In a series of simulations called a B-PAD (Behavioral Police [or Personnel] Assessment Device), police applicants respond orally as they view tapes of situations encountered by police officers.

The development of simulation exercises can be expensive, but prepackaged exercises can be purchased at a much lower price. Though simulation exercises can be expensive, the cost may be money well spent, as simulations result in lower adverse impact than do traditional paper-and-pencil tests (Schmitt & Mills, ).

Work Samples. Usually, when a simulation does not involve a situational exercise, it is called a work sample. Work samples were discussed earlier in this section but are listed again here because they are common assessment center exercises.

Leaderless Group Discussions. In this exercise, applicants meet in small groups and are given a job-related problem to solve or a job-related issue to discuss. For example, supervisory applicants might be asked to discuss ways to motivate employees, or

resident assistant applicants might be asked to discuss ways to reduce noise in res- idence halls. No leader is appointed, hence the term leaderless group discussion. As the applicants discuss the problem or issue, they are individually rated on such dimensions as cooperativeness, leadership, and analytical skills. To better under- stand leaderless group discussions, complete Exercise . in your workbook.

Business Games. Business games are exercises that allow the applicant to dem- onstrate such attributes as creativity, decision making, and ability to work with others. A business game in one assessment center used a series of Tinker Toy models. Four individuals joined a group and were told that they were part of a company that manufactured goods. The goods ranged from Tinker Toy tables to Tinker Toy scuba divers, and the group’s task was to buy the parts, manufacture the products, and then sell the products at the highest profit in an environment in which prices constantly changed.

Evaluation of Assessment Centers Research indicates that assessment centers have been successful in predicting a wide range of employee behavior (Arthur, Day, McNelly, & Edens, ; Gaugler, Rosenthal, Thornton, & Bentson, ). Though assessment center scores are good predictors of performance, it has been argued that other methods can pre- dict the same criteria better and less expensively than assessment centers (Schmidt & Hunter, ). Thus, even though an assessment center may be excellent in predicting certain aspects of employee behavior, other, less expensive methods may be as good if not better. Furthermore, there is some question regarding the ability of an assessment center developed at one location to predict performance in similar jobs at other locations (Schmitt, Schneider, & Cohen, ).

Though assessment centers were once thought to result in low levels of adverse impact, meta-analysis results (Dean, Roth, & Bobko, ) indicate that African Americans (d = .) score substantially lower and Hispanics slightly lower (d = .) on assessment centers than do whites (d = .). Women score higher than men (d = .).
