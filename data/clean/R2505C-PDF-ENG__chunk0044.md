Interpret in motion. Next you act on your hypothesis, exposing yourself

to new cues that enable you to press on or reconsider and pivot. The key

is to take steps that keep your options open—creating what executives

at Amazon call “two-way doors,” which you can walk through but also

back out of if necessary. Avoid becoming too conﬁdent in your initial

interpretation. Stay curious as new information emerges, and be willing

to take equally small steps in a diﬀerent direction.

Initially, Masuda and his team sought to draw power from the one

building on the property that still had it, but the technical challenges

proved too great, so they decided to use the plant’s one functioning

generator and shifted their work from one reactor to another after

determining that the latter was in a more precarious state. They took

small steps, observing, learning, and iterating, and ultimately averted

disaster, while the other Fukushima plant unfortunately did not.
