Analytically savvy. Keep these workers’ skills up-to-date byproviding opportunities for advanced training; encourageparticipation in meet-ups, online user groups and forums; andsupport participation in professional groups and conferences.Assign them responsibility for analytics evangelism andreinforce this in performance objectives. Each evangelistshould have an objective of mentoring one colleague who is lessanalytically capable. If you do not have analytically-savvypeople in your team, hiring a few will help to establish ananalytical culture.

Analytically willing. A good starting point for these employeesis to provide foundational education on HR analytics. This canbe achieved by requiring all HR staﬀ to complete an onlinecourse about the basics of workforce analytics, such as

Wharton’s Coursera HR Analytics Module, which can becompleted in just four weeks with a commitment of one to twohours per week. The analytically willing should then put theirlearning into practice by applying the techniques to their day-to-day work. These expectations can be incorporated as explicitgoals in performance management systems.

Analytically resistant. For these employees, focus on howanalytics can enhance their personal eﬀectiveness. Pair themwith analytically-savvy colleagues to use data and analytics tosolve a problem they are struggling with. If these opportunitiesare declined, it might be necessary to discuss why they arereluctant or what they are struggling with. The ultimate goal isnot necessarily to transform the analytically resistant into dataexperts, but to have them see the value in analytics and, ideally,embrace it as a path to success.
