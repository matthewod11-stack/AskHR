# sustainability challenges.

In recent years, many companies hired a chief sustainability oﬃcer and

established a set of high-priority programs to reduce carbon emissions

and the risk of global climate change. The enactment of these new

regulations signals a new era in which it’s time to extend the concept

of sustainability to include similarly critical issues with the workforce —

an idea I call people sustainability.

People sustainability takes a holistic approach to corporate human

capital practices, including diversity and inclusion, well-being,

employee safety, and fair pay. It raises these human capital issues to the C-suite and obliges chief human resource oﬃcers to work with chief sustainability oﬃcers on these programs. It means that your

employee well-being eﬀorts are no longer delivered piecemeal, which

was ineﬀective no matter how well-intentioned or resourced they might

be.

The EU is essentially saying that all these “HR programs” are much

bigger than HR: They now fall into the category of global citizenship

mandates, and companies must treat and report them as such.
