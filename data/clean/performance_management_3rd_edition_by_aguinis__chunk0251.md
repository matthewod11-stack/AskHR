## Chapter 1 • Performance Management and Reward Systems in Context

- Performance management in Turkey. Performance management in Turkey is evolving rapidly given its official candidacy for European Union membership. Negotiations began in 2005, and it is likely that Turkey will become a European Union member by around 2015. Turkey’s unique contextual issues involve being a democratic and secular state—yet ruled by a single-party government. Performance management is a fairly novel issue in Turkey, but almost 80% of firms in Turkey are using some type of system. Because personal relation- ships play an important role in Turkish culture, an important challenge is the implementation of systems that ensure valid, reliable, and fair performance measurement.

- Performance management in India. The India economy has been on “overdrive” since the early 1990s and there is intense international business activity, including a significant increase in foreign direct investment going into India as well as India firms going abroad. The intense international business activity is leading to a change in traditional values, at least in work environment, from more collectivistic to more individualistic and short-term. Nevertheless, the traditional paternalistic values do not seem to be changing, and they pose a challenge for the implementa- tion of performance management systems in which the supervisor serves as a coach instead of as a “boss” (see Chapter 9).

- Performance management in China. From the founding of the socialist state in 1949 until the 1980s, performance management systems in China emphasized mostly attendance and skills. However, since the 1980s, the view of performance management has expanded to consider broader sets of behaviors as well as the relationship between performance management and other organizational systems (e.g., compensation). Important issues to consider for successful implementation of performance management systems in China include respect for age and senior- ity and the emphasis on social harmony.

- Performance management in South Korea. Work relationships in South Korea are hierarchical in nature and emphasize the importance of groups over individuals. More recently, the establishment of a democratic government in 1987 and the Asian financial crisis of 1997 affected organizational practices substantially. Specifically, the financial crisis led many organizations to adopt what in Korean is called Yunbongje (i.e., merit-based systems). The current challenge is how to reconcile a merit-based approach with more traditional cultural values.

- Performance management in Japan. Although Japanese firms relied on lifetime employment and seniority as key organizational practices, more recently firms also consider the importance of new knowledge acquisition. For example, com- petency modeling, which is discussed in Chapter 8, has become increasingly popular. In general performance management systems in Japan tend to empha- size behaviors to the detriment of results (this distinction is discussed in detail in Chapter 4).

- Performance management in Australia. The Australian economy has made an important shift from manufacturing to service, and there are important demo- graphic changes in the workforce including an increased presence of women and members of ethnic minority groups. The legal framework in Australia is similar to that in the United States and the United Kingdom (see Chapter 10). So, much like
