## 5.1. Findings and theoretical contributions

The question of gender equality has never been a simple question of pure numbers. It is also about meanings, perceptions, identity struggles and power distribution. The main purpose of this thesis was to broaden our understanding of the perceptions of gender inequality and the gender pay gap since these issues have not received much attention in previous research. By means of the data from the Finnish Gender Equality Barometer 2008 and Finnish university data, I intended to examine how individuals and employees with various backgrounds perceive gender inequality, the gender pay gap, and react to pay inequity.

In the thesis, I used three different ways of theorizing. Firstly, I applied liberal feminist theory in order to theorize gender inequality. Based on the main assumption of liberal feminist theory, I conceived gender inequality as socially constructed differences between men and women in the society, by which women continue to experience unequal treatment. I saw the solution for overcoming gender inequality in the strategy of equal opportunities.

Secondly, I illuminated three social psychological theories in order to theorize perceptions of gender inequality. These theories were cognitive dissonance, attribution, and sociometer theories. These theories are common in suggesting that people tend to perceive gender inequality in society in general to a greater extent than in their workplaces.

Thirdly, to the best of my knowledge, there is no single theory, which I would be able to identify and thoroughly explain factors, which have an impact on people’s perceptions of gender inequality and the gender pay gap. I thus applied multiple theoretical perspectives with the intention of identifying the factors, which can explain people’s propensity to perceive gender inequality and the gender pay gap. These theoretical perspectives include gender socialization perspective, expectancy theory, anticipatory injustice model, relative deprivation theory, occupational socialization theory, role-balance theory, equity theory, and social dominance theory. Although these theories and perspectives are unique and explain different phenomena from different angles, they all refer to the process whereby people socialize by learning the process of knowledge and skills necessary to assume their organizational and social roles.

Furthermore, in order to enlighten why, even though female employees tend to earn less than their comparable male counterparts, they continue to be committed to their organizations to the same or even higher degree than their male colleagues, I applied social comparison theory and the gender socialization perspective.

In the following subsections, 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.3, I will describe which theories and perspectives were supported. More concretely, the findings and contributions of the thesis in
