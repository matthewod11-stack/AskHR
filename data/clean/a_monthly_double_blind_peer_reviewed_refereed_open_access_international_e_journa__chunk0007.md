# Motivation results from the interaction of both conscious and unconscious factors

such as the intensity of desire or need, incentive or reward value of the goal, and

expectations of the individual and of his or her peers. These factors are the reasons one

has for behaving a certain way. An example is a student that spends extra time studying

for a test because he or she wants a better grade in the class. Internal and external factors

that stimulate desire and energy in people to be continually interested and committed to a

job, role or subject, or to make an effort to attain a goal.

Most employees need motivation to feel good about their jobs and

perform optimally. Some employees are money motivated while others find recognition

and rewards personally motivating. Motivation levels within the workplace have a direct

impact on employee productivity. Workers who are motivated and excited about their

jobs carry out their responsibilities to the best of their ability and production numbers

increase as a result. An incentive is a motivating influence that is designed to drive

behavior and motivate employees to be produce quality work. Employers use several

types of incentives to increase production numbers. Employee incentives come in a

variety of forms including paid time off, bonuses, cash and travel perks. Incentives drive

employee motivation because they offer workers more to strive for than a regular

paycheck. Many employees need recognition from their employers to produce

quality work. Recognition and employee reward systems identify employees who

perform their jobs well. Acknowledging a job well done makes employees feel good and

encourages them to do good things. Employers recognize workers by tracking progress

and providing feedback about how they have improved over time. Public recognition is

also a motivating factor that drives worker productivity.

Some employees are motivated through feeling a sense of accomplishment and

achievement for meeting personal and professional goals. Many workers are self-

disciplined and self-motivated. Incentive and rewards have little effect on employees

who feel motivated only when they are confident in their abilities and personally

identify with their role within the organization. These individuals perform productively
