can keep companies in the lead over the long run.

To compete in a transient-advantage economy, you must be willing to

honestly assess whether your current advantages are at risk. Companies

that want to create a portfolio of transient advantages need to make

eight major shifts in the way that they operate:

- 1. Think about arenas, not industries.

- 2. Set broad themes, then let people experiment.

- 3. Adopt metrics that support entrepreneurial growth.

- 6. Avoid brutal restructuring and learn healthy disengagement.

- 7. Get systematic about early-stage innovation.

- 8. Experiment, iterate, and learn.
