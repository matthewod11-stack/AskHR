Regardless of the care that is taken in developing the appraisal instrument and the training that is given to a coach, appraisal accuracy can be affected adversely by the organization’s politics. In a study of an Ore- gon newsprint facility and a Seattle bank, self-conﬁdence accurate appraisals was high. In the newsprint facil- ity, however, the performance appraisal did not affect an employee’s status in any way, regardless of whether the appraisal was posi- tive or negative; moreover, the appraisers anticipated neither positive nor negative out- comes for themselves for conducting accu- rate and timely appraisals. Performance appraisal was viewed by everyone as a ‘‘nonevent.’’ In the bank, appraisers feared the organizational consequences of ‘‘making waves.’’ The outcome that they expected, as a result of recording behaviors to document an unfavorable appraisal, was a decrease in the probability of they, themselves, being pro- moted. An organizational culture that fosters high self-conﬁdence and low positive out- come expectancies causes resentment. In these two companies, people who believed that they could make accurate appraisals stopped doing so.
