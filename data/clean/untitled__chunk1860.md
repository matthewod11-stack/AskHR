## Experimental Neurosis and Approach-Avoidance Conﬂict

Other animal behavior studies were conducted within a Freudian framework. They centered on the hypothesis that a conﬂict between a motive toward pleasure (a “drive”) and a fear of punishment (another “drive”) constituted the core element of the psychodynamics of animal—and human— neurosis. Clark Hull at Yale performed much of the initial work. Hull took basic tenets of Pavlovian psychology and sought to integrate them with certain Freudian concepts, with a view to understanding how such conﬂicts might be reduced by suitable environmental manipulations (Miller, 1944). Within this framework other experimenters studied the effect of variables designed to reduce the anxiety component of the conﬂict, thereby permitting the emergence of the positive (approach) component. These studies were attempting to dis- cern “therapeutic” factors that might be applied to neurotic human patients. Investigations using animals included the effects of displacement and escape, Berkun (1957), Elder, Noblin, and Maher (1961), Taylor and Maher (1959), and many others. The paradigm was applied to many aspects of human behavior, including verbal statements in psychother- apy (Murray & Berkun, 1955), and neurotic behavior in gen- eral (Phillips, 1956).

After 1960, this approach declined, partly because of developing doubt about Freudian explanations of psy- chopathology. Another reason was methodological con- straints involved in generalizing from animals to humans and increasing criticisms of the approach-avoidance model itself (e.g., Atthowe, 1960; Maher, 1964). Although laboratory animal research of this kind declined, the application of these ideas to humans was to become one of the main themes of behavior therapy.
