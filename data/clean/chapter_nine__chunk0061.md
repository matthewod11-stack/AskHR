Box 2 cont’d. Teamwork. Team learning and effectiveness is valued (Northcott, 1999; Chan, 2001; Manojlovich and Ketefian, 2002); promoted (Kalish and Aebersold, 2006) and recognised through interdisciplinary collaboration (Raiger, 2005; Forsythe, 2005) and team development (Mulchay and Betts, 2005; Manley and Hardy, 2005).

Safety (holistic) is valued rather than just complied with (Clark, 2002). This is consistent with value driven units’ influence on development of a safety culture (Kalish and Aebersold, 2006). Safety embraces physical, psychological and social aspects for all staff, patients and users (Firth-Cozens, 2001; Groah and Butler, 2006). This is reflected in a commitment to reduce adverse events for patients (Bhatia et al., 2003); fostering prevention (Schneider et al., 2003); disclosure of errors (Clark, 2002; Hart and Hazelgrove, 2001); as well as the encouragement of error reporting and looking for the unexpected (Kalish and Aebersold, 2006); promotion of a safety culture for all (Hewison, 1999; Clark, 2002); with the identification and management of risk (Cox et al., 2006) is considered part of the job (Scalzi et al., 2006).

The ten values, as an aide-memoire, can be organised around three interrelated domains or clusters as outlined in Figure 1. Person centredness is the value that guides the overarching approach taken in relationships with everyone; patients, service users and colleagues as well as other stakeholders. Working with others identifies the key values influencing how staff work with each other and stakeholders. Finally, the specific values necessary for sustaining effective care to patients and service users are clustered together.
