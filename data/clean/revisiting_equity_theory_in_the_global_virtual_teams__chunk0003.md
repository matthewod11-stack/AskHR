# Abstract:

Purpose The purpose of this study is to test whether equity theory (ET) individuals compare their outcome/input ratio to the ratio of a individuals as Benevolent, Equity Sensity, and Entitled – applies to the modern workplace of global virtual teams (GVT), where work is mostly intellectual, geographically dispers making individual effort nearly impossible to observe directly.

Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of 1,343 GVTs comprised 6,347 individuals from 137 countries, this study tests three ET’s predictions in the GVT context: a negative, l inear relationship between Benevolents’ perceptions of equity and job satisfaction in GVTs; an inverted U-shaped relationship between Equity Sensitives’ perceptions of equity and job satisfa ction in GVTs; and a positive, linear relationship between Entitleds’ perceptions of equi ty and job satisfaction in GVTs.

Findings Although the second prediction of ET is supported, the first and third have statisticall y significant opposite signs.

studies in Practical implications The research has important ramifications for management explaining differences in organizational behavior in GVTs as opposed to traditional work settings.

Originality/value The authors conclude that the main novelty with ET in GVTs is that GVTs are an environment stingy with satisfaction for “takers” (Entitleds) and generous i n satisfaction for “givers” (Benevolents).
