# National Psychological Associations 543

through a governing board, which was empowered to do busi- ness on behalf of the society. From its inception to the time of this writing, the society has succeeded remarkably well in keeping its governance simple and maintaining its focus as a hard-nosed scientiﬁc psychological organization.

The Psychonomic Society experienced rapid growth. Its membership standards were the PhD and a record of success- ful publication beyond the degree. Ironically, these were the standards for APA membership prior to 1926 (Fernberger, 1932). Although membership requirements have varied slightly over the years, including the development of an asso- ciate membership, the basic requirements have changed little. The membership total at the end of the ﬁrst year was 772. That number rose steadily over the years and had stabilized at approximately 2,000 members by the 1990s. Associate mem- bership also grew from its inception in 1975 to between 400 and 500 during the 1990s.

At the end of the twentieth century, the Psychonomic Society published six major experimental psychology jour- nals. Journal publication had been one of the two primary purposes of the society at its founding, but it took several years before the society was able to begin its publishing pro- gram. It was able to do so through the generosity of one of its founders, Clifford T. Morgan. Morgan began a journal, Psy- chonomic Science, in 1964. This was followed in relatively quick succession by Psychonomic Monograph Supplements (1965) and Perception & Psychophysics (1966). In 1967, Morgan gave the journals to the Psychonomic Society. The society initially struggled with its management of the jour- nals but by the mid-1970s had overcome most of its publica- tion problems. The society split Psychonomic Science into four volumes and added others, so that by 2000 it published AnimalLearning&Behavior,BehaviorResearchMethods,In- struments,&Computers,Memory&Cognition,Perception& Psychophysics, Psychobiology, and Psychonomic Bulletin & Review(Dewsbury,1996).

Other experimental societies have formed over the years in reaction to the size or policies of the APA. To note one other example, the Society of Experimental Social Psychol- ogy formed in 1965 to promote scientiﬁc communication among those social psychologists that viewed themselves as experimentalists. A small group of social psychologists de- cried the large meetings of the APA and the rapid growth of its Division 8 (Personality and Social Psychology). They, like the founders of the Psychonomic Society, wanted a society whose members were experimentalists. The initial intent of the group was to keep the society small in number. That pol- icy has been maintained, as indicated by its membership of only 600 by the year 2000 (Blascovich, 2000; Hollander, 1968).
