First impressions . Research from many areas of psychology indicates that we remember our first impression of someone (primacy effect) more than we remember later behaviors. Consequently, supervisors recall behaviors that are consistent with their first impression of an employee, even though those first behaviors may not have been representative of the employee’s typical performance. Being aware of first impressions is important because performance can be dynamic, meaning that a person who is the top performer one year may not be the top performer during another year (Reb & Greguras, ). Recent behaviors recall the most recent behavior that occurred during the evaluation period. Unusual or extreme behaviors behaviors more than they remember common behaviors. For example, if an average-performing police officer captures an important criminal, the officer’s performance evaluations are likely to be inappropriately high. Likewise, a good officer who makes a terrible mistake is likely to receive inappropriately low ratings. Behavior consistent with the supervisor’s opinion opinion of someone, we tend to look for behaviors that confirm that opinion. If a supervisor likes an employee, she will probably recall only behaviors consistent with that opinion. The opposite would be true for a supervisor who disliked an employee. Once you get on someone’s bad side, it is hard to get off of it.

getting into arguments with customers, a supervisor can use documented critical incidents to show the employee the specific incidents and behaviors that are problematic.

Fourth, documentation helps an organization defend against legal actions taken against it by an employee who was terminated or denied a raise or promotion. As will be discussed later in this chapter, the courts closely exam- ine the accuracy of the performance ratings upon which personnel decisions are based. Judges and juries are not likely to accept a supervisor’s rating as proof of poor performance. Instead, they want to see proof of the behaviors that caused the supervisor to rate the employee poorly. Without documentation, employ- ers will seldom win lawsuits filed against them (Foster, ). The courts’ need for documentation is supported by research indicating that when evaluators must justify their performance ratings, their ratings are more accurate (Mero & Motowidlo, ).

To use critical incidents to document performance, a supervisor maintains a log of all the critical behaviors she observes her employees performing. These behaviors are then used during the performance appraisal review process to assign a rating for each employee. The log refreshes the supervisor’s memory of her employees’ performance and also provides justification for each performance rating. The use of log books to record behaviors not only provides an excellent source of documentation but also results in more accurate performance apprais- als (Bernardin & Walter, ). This is especially true if the logs are organized by employee rather than maintained as only a random collection of incidents observed on the job (DeNisi & Peters, ).

A more formal method for using critical incidents in evaluating performance was developed by Flanagan and Burns () for use by General Motors. Called the Employee Performance Record, this method consists of a two-color form similar to that shown in Figure .. Half of the sheet is used to record examples of good behaviors, and the other half to record examples of poor behaviors. On each side, there are columns for each of the relevant performance dimensions. Supervisors have a separate record for each employee and at the end of the day can record the observed behaviors.

The advantage of this format is that supervisors are allowed to record only job- relevant behaviors. At the end of the performance appraisal period (every  months), the supervisor has a record of job-relevant behaviors recorded in an organized fashion. The Employee Performance Record had several positive effects for General Motors. The number of disciplinary warnings declined, suggestions in the company suggestion box increased, and productivity increased. When the use of critical incidents was first announced, supervisors at General Motors were opposed, thinking it would take too much time. The actual time per day spent on recording the incidents, however, was only five minutes.
