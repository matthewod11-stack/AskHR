# An Internal Committee Votes

Many projects show merit on at least some dimension, so discerning

their overall comparative worth is key to eﬀective prioritization. This

is where voting, which is believed to be the most commonly practiced method, falls short. Tallying yes/no votes often fails to provide suﬃcient

gradation, requiring arbitrary tie breaks. So if your budget permits a few

projects only, make it go further by adopting a method such as ranking

that our research shows as identifying the top candidates more reliably.

With a bigger budget, scoring is an alternative.

Voting is advisable only with large crowds. Open-science platform

EteRNA, for example, pools the assessments of hundreds of scientists,

in order to select the most promising protein molecules for further

study. Local governments running participative budgeting platforms

may similarly adopt the approach. With very large sets of decision

makers, voting’s ability to discriminate improves.
