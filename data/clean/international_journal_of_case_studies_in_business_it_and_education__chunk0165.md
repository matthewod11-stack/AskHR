culture on employee mental health and well-being. This can be accomplished by implementing a variety of interventions, including encouraging work-life balance, offering social support, establishing effective leadership techniques, supporting fairness and justice, making the most of job resources, and lowering stigma surrounding mental illness. Organizations must put their employees' mental health and wellbeing first in order to attain this ideal outcome, and they must engage in therapies that deal with the detrimental effects of toxic workplace environments. This necessitates a change in company culture and values to one that is more encouraging and employee-centered. As part of the necessary improvements, managers and supervisors must be trained to recognise and address mental health issues, resources and services must be made available, and the influence of workplace culture on employee mental health and well- being must be frequently assessed and monitored. Organizations can foster a healthy workplace culture that benefits both employees and the business as a whole by placing a high priority on employee mental health and well-being.

- 7. RESEARCH GAP :

An important and challenging area of research is the connection between workplace culture and outcomes related to mental health and wellbeing. Although there is data to support the idea that a supportive employment environment might result in better mental health and well-being outcomes, there are still many open issues and knowledge gaps in this field. The particular mechanisms by which workplace culture affects mental health outcomes, as well as the part played by individual characteristics (such as personality and coping mechanisms) in this relationship, are just a few examples where additional research is needed. Further research is also required to determine the efficacy of initiatives designed to enhance workplace culture and advance employee wellbeing. In order to completely comprehend the connection between workplace culture and mental health/well-being outcomes and to create efficient interventions to enhance employee well-being, further study is required.

- 8. RESEARCH AGENDAS BASED ON RESEARCH GAP :

- 1. Investigate the specific mechanisms by which workplace culture impacts mental health outcomes: The specific elements of workplace culture (such as corporate ideals, leadership philosophies, and communication patterns) that influence better or worse outcomes in terms of mental health should be the subject of future research. To learn more about the connection between workplace culture and mental health, researchers could use qualitative techniques like focus groups or interviews.

- 2. Examine the significance of individual characteristics in the association between workplace culture and mental health outcomes: While there is evidence to support this, it is likely that the relationship is regulated by individual differences such personality, coping mechanisms, and social support. Future studies could examine the interactions between these personal variations and workplace culture and how they affect mental health outcomes.

- 3. Assess the success of initiatives to enhance workplace culture and advance employee wellbeing: While workplace treatments aiming at enhancing employee well-being are receiving more attention, these initiatives still require more thorough evaluations. To assess the efficacy of interventions like leadership development courses, wellness initiatives, and flexible work schedules, researchers could perform randomised controlled trials.

- 4. Explore the impact of workplace culture on different subgroups of employees: Workplace culture may impact mental health outcomes differently for different subgroups of employees (such as those with disabilities, minority groups, and older workers). Future research should explore how workplace culture impacts mental health outcomes for these subgroups and develop tailored interventions to address their unique needs.

- 9. ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH AGENDA :

The proposed research agenda emphasises the need for additional investigation of the link between workplace culture and outcomes related to mental health. It recommends that researchers look into the precise mechanisms by which workplace culture affects mental health outcomes, investigate the significance of individual differences, assess the efficacy of workplace interventions, and take into account the influence of workplace culture on various employee subgroups. Organizations can increase
