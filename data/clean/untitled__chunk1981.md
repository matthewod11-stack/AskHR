# Treatment Interventions 349

psychotherapy came under attack from four “revolutions” or “movements”: (1) community psychology, which argued that psychotherapy was futile and not provided to those most in need of it, and that clinicians should direct their efforts to- ward preventing psychopathology through bringing about changes in deleterious social policies and conditions (see the chapter by Wilson, Hayes, Greene, Kelly, & Iscoe in this volume); (2) humanistic psychology, which emphasized the importance of present experiences, ongoing events, and confrontational approaches in groups, as contrasted with traditionalapproachestotheindividual’sexplorationandinte- gration of the past; (3) the increasing use of drugs, by physi- cians and by free spirits, to alter moods, regulate behaviors, and enhance self-esteem and experiences; and (4) behavior therapy.

It was the English clinician Hans Eysenck who was less than enthusiastic about clinical psychologists becoming psy- chotherapists and raised the question of whether scientiﬁc studies had demonstrated the effectiveness of psychotherapy (Eysenck, 1952). Culling the research and pulling together a motley group of studies, he concluded that they failed to demonstrate that control groups were signiﬁcantly less likely to improve than groups that received psychotherapy. Al- though psychotherapists strongly disagreed with his conclu- sion and manner of arriving at it, the fact remained that it was their responsibility to prove otherwise.

In South Africa, psychiatrist Joseph Wolpe made use of Hullian concepts and learning principles to develop proce- dures that would reduce neurotic symptoms. In essence, he sought to elicit responses, such as relaxation, that would be incompatible with or inhibit a symptom, such as anxiety or fear. (This is similar to the previously discussed decondition- ing or reconditioning approach of Mary Cover Jones.) After coming to the United States to spend a year at Stanford Uni- versity’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sci- ences, Wolpe (1958) published a book, Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition, which was hailed by Eysenck as a promising advance in effective treatment.

Wolpe took a position at the University of Virginia Med- ical School, and in 1962, along with Salter and Reyna, spon- sored a conference there that got the behavior therapy ball rolling (Wolpe, Salter, & Reyna, 1964). The clinical journals were soon ﬁlled with a variety of studies, many of them quite ingenious, demonstrating the effectiveness of behavioral approaches.

One of the ﬁrst of these studies was one by Peter Lang and David Lazovik (1963) of college students who were identi- ﬁed by a questionnaire, the Fear Survey Schedule, as being afraid of snakes. The students were then given a Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT) in which they were placed in a room
