## Many ﬁrms, staﬀed with smart people and cutting-edge analytics, count

themselves lucky when a tenth of the innovations they pursue are

successful. Adjusting the committee’s decision rule can thus quickly

make a commercial diﬀerence, even if it is just one more project than

usual that is correctly accepted or rejected, respectively.

Our research recommends ranking in many situations. Many people are

familiar with the process of ranking something. Adopting a ranking rule

for portfolio selection thus is not a wrenching ask. Naturally, it is not

the only means of improving innovation success rates. But compared to

adjusting the salary incentives for your innovators, or redesigning the

internal resource-allocation process, it looks like a quick win.
