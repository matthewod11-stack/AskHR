# What Do You Think? 7

Do you see any potential ethical dilemmas of recruiting and hiring based on looks? If so, what are they? Is it ethical to take a less skilled applicant over a more skilled one just because one is more attractive than the other? Is it fair or ethical for places like Borgata Casino and Spa to refuse employment to less than average looking employees? Is there a more ethical way to balance the rights of companies to have attractive people and the rights of people who are perceived as unattractive? Do you think that more states and cities should make laws against discrimination of people based on their looks?
