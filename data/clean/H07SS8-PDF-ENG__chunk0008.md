## HBR / Digital Article / How to Avoid the Churn That Comes with Agility

one is willing to take any initiative,” she said, “since whatever we do is

probably going to be changed.”

This dynamic of over-agility is an issue for small startups and large

companies alike. Several years ago, I worked with a multibillion dollar

personal care company that had made three midsized acquisitions as

a way of diversifying their product portfolio. Because each of these

acquisitions included well-known brands, the CEO planned to leave

them alone to operate as wholly owned but independent entities. But

after a few months, under pressure from the board to extract more

synergistic value from the acquisitions, he changed course and asked

his corporate functions (HR, ﬁnance, and so on) to align the acquired

entities’ processes and systems with those of the core company. But

having people from all the corporate functions descend on the acquired ﬁrms proved to be disruptive, so he then backed oﬀ and told the

corporate functions to just pick one or two systems to standardize.

By this time, the managers of the acquired entities were completely

confused about what their owners really wanted and told their people to

just sit tight and not do anything until things became clearer.

In both of the cases cited here, and in many other instances of over-

agility, leaders pay so much attention to the means of achieving a goal

that they (and their teams) lose focus on the end result. In the tech

startup, the founder wanted the experiments to reveal new product

opportunities but didn’t make clear his vision for the next generation
