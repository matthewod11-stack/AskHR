# (i) Religion.

Religion-based stigmas differ across (a) nations and (b) subcultures within nations. For instance, because the U.S. is a predominantly Christian nation (Smith, 1994), Jews are often stereotyped as being pushy, greedy, and lacking social skills (Fiske et al., 2002; Korman, 1989). As a consequence, Jewish-Americans are less likely to be hired for jobs requiring interpersonal competence and warmth than are Christians (Korman, 1989). Relatedly, research shows that Israeli immigrants to the U.S. often avoid contact with other Jews in the hopes of avoiding stigmatization (Shokeid, 1993).

The existence of cross-cultural differences in stereotypes about members of various religious groups is also clear from the ongoing religion-based wars in such nations as Bosnia, India, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, and Sudan. Members of the dominant religious groups in these nations often denigrate, aggress against, and attempt to annihilate those who do not share their religious beliefs. History provides far too many vivid and tragic illustrations of this.
