At age 29, Nick LoManto led a busy life. He was moving up in his

job as a manager of investment analysts at the ﬁnancial services ﬁrm,

Vanguard. At home, he and his wife were settling into their marriage

and starting to think about growing their family. “There I was, a ﬁnance

professional with every gift a person could wish for,” he told me. But

something was missing.
