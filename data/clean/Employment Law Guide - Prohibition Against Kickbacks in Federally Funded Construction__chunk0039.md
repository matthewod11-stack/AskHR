## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

The "Anti-Kickback" provisions apply to contractors and subcontractors that perform work on contracts for construction or repair to which a federal agency is a party or that are Ô¨Ånanced in whole or in part by loans or

grants from the federal government, except for those contracts where the only federal assistance is a loan

guarantee. The provisions of the Act and the regulation pertaining to the weekly payroll reports and payroll

deductions apply to contractors and subcontractors performing on federally assisted contracts, including

contracts for which the only federal assistance is a loan guarantee or insurance, but only if the contractor or subcontractor is subject to federal wage standards.
