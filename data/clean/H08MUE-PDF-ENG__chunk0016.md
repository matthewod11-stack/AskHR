# The Pushback

Despite the beneﬁts of remote leadership, there are still plenty of

objections. For one, managing employees from a distance—without

being physically present—requires leadership skills that are diﬃcult,

don’t come naturally, and often aren’t taught in business schools or

corporate universities. For example, leaders who manage remotely need to ﬁnd diﬀerent ways of building a cohesive culture, bonding with their

people, managing social isolation and mental health, and making sure

that processes are coordinated across groups. None of this is easy, which

may explain why 70% of managers in one survey last year said that it’s

easier to supervise employees in person.

Remotely based leaders can also become invisible to their people and

to key stakeholders they need to inﬂuence, falling victim to the “out of

sight, out of mind” syndrome. No matter how good they are at their jobs,

they may not be asked to participate in key task forces or be considered

for new assignments. So in many cases, it’s just easier for leaders to go

back to the way it was.
