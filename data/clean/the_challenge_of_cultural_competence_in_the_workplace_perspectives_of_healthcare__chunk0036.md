attending their organization. “Our organization does an excellent job of hiring diverse staff members, for the most part, especially in our refugee services and support staff positions” (Mental Health Professional). “Having pro- viders and staff with different cultural backgrounds has been useful” (Hospital/Clinic Administrator).

Assessment of needs/rapport development Some participants underscored the benefits of directly asking patients about their cultural needs and how best they could be accommodated. “Asking how we can best care for their cultural needs at first appointment” (Reg- istered Nurse). Other participants reported that profes- sionals at their organization spent some time ‘getting to know’ patients from different cultural backgrounds in order to establish a relationship of trust. “We treat a lot of different cultures and we ask questions sometimes in order to get to know them…culturally some people need more time with a doctor than others which can make it difficult but can also be beneficial in creating a bond” (Interpreter).

Resources Four participants commented positively on their organiza- tion’s provision of cross-cultural educational resources for both patients - “We have information printed in different information” languages for communication of medical (Physician), and staff - “Education and resources related to all cultures available to staff” (Registered Nurse).

What was the nature of the training? This open-ended question followed the initial yes/no question, “Did your health care training include a cul- tural awareness/competence component”, to which 57.1% (n = 32) participants affirmed that they had re- ceived some form of cultural training as part of their professional education. The thematic responses from these 32 participants are illustrated below.

Format Ten participants indicated that the training they had undertaken was online. A smaller number of partici- pants stated that cross-cultural training was conveyed through presentations from guest speakers and a fur- ther two participants claimed that their training was obtained through clinical experience. The majority of participants stated that the training was a requirement for all staff members. “The cultural competence training is an online course which all staff must complete when they are first hired, and then annually afterwards” (Mental Health Professional). “Required for licensing” (Mental Health Professional).
