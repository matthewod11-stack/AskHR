ABSTRACT:

"Human Factors and Ergonomics" is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on optimizing the interaction between humans and their environment, products, systems, or processes to enhance performance, safety, and well-being. This discipline draws from psychology, engineering, physiology, and other related fields to understand how humans perceive, interact with, and adapt to various systems and technologies. By studying human capabilities and limitations, researchers in human factors and ergonomics aim to design and improve products and environments to better accommodate human needs, abilities, and preferences. This can include designing user-friendly interfaces for digital devices, optimizing workplace layouts to reduce the risk of injuries and enhance productivity, and ensuring that transportation systems are safe and comfortable for passengers. Ultimately, human factors and ergonomics play a pivotal role in enhancing the usability, efficiency, and safety of various aspects of human life, from the design of everyday objects to complex industrial and organizational systems.
