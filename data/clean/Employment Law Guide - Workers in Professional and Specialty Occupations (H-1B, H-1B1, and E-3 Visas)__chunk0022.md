# distinguished merit and ability, using the H-1B nonimmigrant visa classiﬁcation. The H-1B1 program is for hiring nonimmigrant

aliens from Chile and Singapore as workers in specialty occupations and the E-3 is for hiring nonimmigrant aliens from Australia as workers in specialty occupations.

The INA allows employment of alien workers in certain specialty occupations (generally those requiring at least a bachelor's

degree or its equivalent). Foreign workers such as engineers, teachers, computer programmers, medical doctors, and physical therapists may be employed under the H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 visa classiﬁcation.

The INA sets forth certain prerequisites for employers wishing to employ H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 nonimmigrant workers. To obtain

H-1B or H-1B1 status approval, the employer must ﬁrst ﬁle a Labor Condition Application (LCA), Form ETA 9035 or Form ETA

9035E, with the Department of Labor. The employer must state that it will:

Pay the nonimmigrant workers at least the local prevailing wage or the employer's actual wage, whichever is higher; pay for non-productive time in certain circumstances; and oﬀer beneﬁts on the same basis as for U.S. workers;

Provide working conditions for H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 workers that will not adversely aﬀect the working conditions of workers

similarly employed;

Not employ an H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 worker at a location where a strike or lockout in the occupational classiﬁcation is occurring,

and notify ETA of any future strike or lockout; and On or within 30 days before the date the LCA is ﬁled with ETA, provide notice of the employer's intent to hire H-1B, H-1B1, or

E-3 workers. The employer must provide this notice to the bargaining representative of workers in the occupation in which the

H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 worker will be employed. If there is no bargaining representative, the employer must post such notices in

conspicuous locations at the intended place(s) of employment, or provide them electronically.

The number of new visas that can be issued each year is subject to a cap. H-1B visas are capped at 65,000 during a ﬁscal year; an additional 20,000 are available to those individuals who received a master's degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher

education. H-1B1 visas are limited to 1,400 nationals of Chile and 5,400 nationals of Singapore; E-3 visas are limited to 10,500
