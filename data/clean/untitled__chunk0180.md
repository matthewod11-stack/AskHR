## The Rise of Cognitive Psychology: Mentalism Revisited

The experiments engendered by the debates among the dif- ferent approaches to learning and behavior continued to dominate the literature of experimental psychology at mid- century. However, the traditional methods and research top- ics of the psychological laboratory also ﬂourished; although the era of the schools had ended, they left a legacy of inﬂu- ence on the research conducted within psychology. Intro- spection as a source of psychological data lost its primacy with the end of structuralism; introspective reports resumed their more limited role in assessing the quality and/or inten- sity of sensory experience in psychophysical experiments. Articles reporting on experiments on perception, stimulated in part by gestalt psychology’s emphasis upon perceptual organization, continued to appear in psychological journals, together with studies of the higher mental processes of think- ing and problem solving (e.g., Wertheimer, 1959). Functional psychology, more of an attitude than a systematic position, characterized American psychology generally and fostered experiments on serial list and paired associate learning and the interference theory of forgetting, continuing the research tradition emanating from the laboratories of Ebbinghaus and G. E. Müller (McGeoch, 1942). Although research on higher mental processes in animals had not been entirely neglected (Dewsbury, 2000), behaviorism left a legacy of animal re- search that focused on stimulus-response interpretations of the results of maze learning studies, classical conditioning experiments, and, increasingly, of behavior in operant- conditioning chambers. Psychology redeﬁned itself from the science of mind to the science of behavior. References to mind or mental processes were found only infrequently in textbooks and journals.

The molecular, elemental, and mechanistic analyses of be- haviorism, emphasizing peripheral sensory-motor relations, were not limited to research on learning. Child psychology, for example, was strongly inﬂuenced by studies of the condi- tioned reﬂex (e.g., Mateer, 1918) and Watson’s admitted pre- mature claim that, given a dozen healthy infants, he could make of them anything he chose (J. B. Watson, 1924). Emphasis on the study of sensory-motor and nervous-system development in young children led to an emphasis on devel- opmental norms that were postulated to follow relatively ﬁxed maturational principles (e.g., Gesell & Ilg, 1946). These prin- ciples and norms were challenged by research that combined
