# 6.2 Managerial implications

In todayâ€™s business environment, the quest for efficiency and productivity has become of utmost importance. At all levels of the organizational hierarchy employees, middle-management and top-management are under an increased pressure to achieve higher performance in their respective roles. Our findings suggest that by using coaching managers can achieve higher role performance by helping their subordinates increase their own job performance.

Another implication for managers concerns the quantification of the impact of coaching on employee performance. Although this impact is not very strong, it is noticeable. Accordingly, managers performing coaching with their subordinates should see an increase in their performance after some interventions. This would help them evaluate also how effective they were in providing coaching. If no performance increment is seen, then the manager could question himself whether he is providing good coaching or any other factors could be hindering with subordinate performance. The analysis or the measuring items in Table 2 can guide the conscious manager who analyzes his coaching performance critically.

Following the same line of thought, items in Table 2 can help the manager in preparing the coaching intervention. It was proposed that some coaching interventions take place on-the-go, in a more informal way, while others are pre-programmed and are more formal in nature (Richardson, 2009). While getting ready for a pre-programmed, formal coaching intervention, the manager could go through the items in Table 2 to prepare a more effective coaching conversation.

Finally, our results contribute to the literature quantifying the effects of coaching on performance. In the case or organizations willing to implement or develop coaching programs, these results can help them estimate the potential impact on their performance and the return of their investments in the program. This is also a way of improving organizational decision-making.
