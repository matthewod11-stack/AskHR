## Operational transparency: The deliberate design of windows into and

out of the organization’s operations to help customers understand

and appreciate the value being added. Witnessing the hidden work

performed on their behalf can make customers more satisﬁed, more

willing to pay, and more loyal. It can also make employees more

satisﬁed by demonstrating to them that they are serving their customers

well. To create operational transparency, consider what to reveal, when

to reveal it, and how to reveal it.
