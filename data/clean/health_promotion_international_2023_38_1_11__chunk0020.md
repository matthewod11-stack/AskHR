themselves to exchange orders and help one another in meeting deadlines while boycotting work meetings with the overall production manager (field notes). At the same time, the overall production manager reported experiencing the same balancing act:

Within the production halls, the short-term orders result in stress and unrest, which might increase absenteeism. Long-term orders with a low inten- sity and a constant work pressure without peaks is much better for employees. Yet, the shareholders prefer short-term orders because they yield more production and profit. (field notes)

Due to the perceived lack of communication, involve- ment and recognition of each other’s expertise at all levels, it seemed that the supervisors and the produc- tion manager did not know about each other’s shared struggle. This led the supervisors to arrange business among themselves, boosting a sense of belonging to that supportive group while worsening the feeling of organizational unbelonging as a whole and impairing the perceived health at work among employees (deal- ing with peaks in workload and frustrated supervisors), supervisors (balancing caring and reaching goals) and overall production managers (basically struggling with the same balancing act).

As in the industrial production company, the spa- tio-material dimension of belonging also plays a role in the social workplace. Here, the productional halls were located in different wings and hallways than the offices of managers, board members and admin- istrative departments. Yet, while all employees in the industrial production company could move freely from one building to another, production employees in the social workplace mainly stayed within the produc- tion area during most of their workweek. To enter the office area for meetings with HR or occupational sup- port, their supervisor either had to accompany them to open the door or they had to ring the bell so the receptionist could (after confirming the appointment) give them access to the office hallways. As researches, we got badges that gave us conveniently access to both hallways, with the exception of the board and finance hallway. A few weeks into fieldwork, we remarked that most employees of the mailing and packaging division knew that we had access and they deliberately waited for us to get in and out of the office area. The badge as a material object articulated the internalized biog- raphies of organizational unbelonging (the feeling of not fitting) in relation to space or, stated differently, of those who belonged and had access to both areas and those who did not belong and only had access to the production area. The badges’ underlying medi- ation of (un)belonging serves as an example of how
