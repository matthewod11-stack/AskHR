direct colleagues and got sincere compliments from the supervisor. However, the group leaders, who super- vised the daily execution of tasks, did not show much appreciation, except for a thumbs-up or a quick ‘Well done!’ This disappointed him: ‘a compliment would be good for your frame of mind’ (field notes), show- ing how being valued impacts one’s perceived health. When asked about his experiences with managers higher-up, he claimed that apart from the HR manager who visited the production halls every week, he did not feel recognized by supervisors from ‘way above’:

Sometimes, the board comes to the work floor to peek at us monkeys [in Dutch: aapjes kijken]. They come here with posh ladies or new clients to look at us. They then gather around you with their hands on their back, looking over your shoulder while not saying a word. I don’t like that. (field notes)

The supervisor of the mailing and packaging division explained that she had knowl- edge about every employee in her team, for instance, how to approach employees or leave them alone. This was deemed essential in the early caring model, but there was no time for that anymore due to the produc- tion model of the contemporary social workplace:

I don’t think the board knows how important the knowledge is that I have about each employee. I know how to play the game every day, but you don’t know these things just like that; that is the result of a year-long investment. (interview)

Almost every week, we witnessed the supervisor balancing between caring for the team and reaching production targets. She often raised the point that it was difficult for her and her fellow supervisors to meet targets and deadlines while taking care of employ- ees. As the supervisors believed that this struggle was not resolved by the board and the overall production manager, the supervisors made arrangements among
