- 3. Job Rotation:

Job rotation is a practice whereby each employee learns several operations in

manufacturing process and rotates through each in a set period. Job rotation has

important implications for firm learning. On one hand, when employees rotate, the firm

receives information about the quality of various jobs - employee matches. On the other

hand, without rotation, the firm receives only direct information about one match, but the

information it gets about this one match is very reliable.
