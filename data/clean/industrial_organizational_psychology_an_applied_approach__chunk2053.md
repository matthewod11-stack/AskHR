# Employee Participation

Until fairly recently, it was generally thought that a goal would lead to the greatest increase in productivity if it was set at least in part by the employee. That is, although performance would increase if the supervisor set the employ- ee’s goal, it would increase even more if the employee participated. However, several meta-analyses have indicated that participating in goal setting does not increase performance (Mento, Steel, & Karren, ; Tubbs, ; Zetik &

are leaving the workforce. It is absolutely critical for the OD manager to develop and imple- ment strategies which grow and develop young leaders. When I develop a new training program, I use a variety of concepts to assist the class participants not only in acquiring the new skill, but in actually using the skill in the workplace. I incorporate expectancy theory in training programs by putting myself in the place of the employees and thinking about how this new skill will help them in their jobs. I ask myself questions I think participants would ask. For example: 7

How will this help me in my job? What makes it better than what I am already doing?

What activities, or set of activities, will this replace? What are the short-term effects compared with the long-term benefits? How different is this from what I am currently doing? This is also referred to as the “What’s In It For Me” (WIIFM) factor. When develop- ing any soft- or hard-skills training, you should have a sound rationale for how it will help employees do their jobs better, faster, or cheaper. To motivate participants, it is essential to identify with their needs and how something new can make them more productive.

In my experience, an easy way to initiate behavior change is to incorporate goal setting into the current performance

management system. I typically have managers determine their professional and personal goals at the beginning of a project. Once these goals are established, I have each team member evaluate their goals using the SMART methodology you read about in this chapter.

I truly enjoy working in the OD field. It is a smaller niche of what is available to those who pursue a career in industrial/ organizational psychology, but it is a rewarding experience. If you are looking to pursue a career in this field, there are two things I recommend as part of your professional development plan. The first is getting as much experience as you can in implementing any change initiatives—in

activities like developing and facilitating training programs, management coaching, merger and acquisitions task forces, anything that will provide exposure to the outcomes of change. I believe the best way to design and implement OD interventions is to have a working knowledge of what works in a given organization. The second thing I would recommend is always work on building your relation- ships. You constantly have to work at achieving buy-in and commitment at all levels of the organization and finding how to connect with as many people as possible. No matter what direction you take in your career, you will have the utmost success when you can work well with others.
