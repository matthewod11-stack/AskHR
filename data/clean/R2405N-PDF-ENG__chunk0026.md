## and Happiness, by the former tech and ﬁnance executive and venture

capitalist Peggy Van de Plassche, who claims that despite years of

professional achievement, she was able to ﬁnd true fulﬁllment only

through a combination of journaling, tapping (an anxiety-reducing

technique whereby one taps on parts of the body while holding or

releasing certain thoughts and feelings), visualization, meditation, and

small doses of psychedelics. Hoping that others will follow her lead,

she oﬀers a step-by-step guide. “Since using this regimen myself, I have

never experienced so much ease, freedom and success in my life,” Van

de Plassche writes. “I now let my unconscious mind do the work and

it comes up with way better and faster solutions than I could have

consciously.”
