# Expertise

Expertise is the result of a dedicated application to a specific field of interest (Cross, 2004). According to Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Romer (1993), deliber- ate practice guided toward improvement of performance is necessary to reach high levels of performance and the acquisition of expertise. Ericsson et al. added that the achieved level of performance of an expert is closely related to the accumulated amount of practice. Therefore, the development of expertise passes through differ- ent phases. Something happens in the development from being a novice to becom- ing an expert.

The major difference between experts and novices is that experts have accumu- lated a large number of examples of problems and solutions in a specific domain of interest. A key competency of an expert is the ability to mentally stand back from the specifics of the accumulated examples and form more abstract conceptu- alizations related to their domain of expertise (Akin & Akin, 1996; Ho, 2001). Experts are believed to be able to store and access information in larger cognitive chunks than novices can and to recognize underlying principles rather than focus- ing on the surface features of problems (Dorner, 1999; Nigel, 2004; Purcell & Gero, 1996; Suwa et al., 2000). Therefore, the accumulation of experience is crit- ical in the transformation from a novice to an expert.

In many areas, like sports and music, the benefits of dedicated practice are well known and there are established programs of training for novices to help them gain experience and expertise over time (Cross, 2004). It may be beneficial in other areas as well to focus on the transformational phases (i.e., novice through expert), such as in design thinking. In design education, there are well-established practices that are presumed to help the development from novice to expert, but there is still little understanding of the differences between novice and expert performance in design.
