women who provide frank negative feedback risk being perceived

as combative. One 2020 study conducted at Stanford University

demonstrated that while women and men are equally likely to be

described as having technical ability, women are signiﬁcantly more

likely to be described as aggressive. That’s why women who provide

candid feedback risk being perceived as on the attack.

The dynamics are just as complicated but completely diﬀerent for men.

In 2008 an essay by Rebecca Solnit inspired the term “mansplaining,”

which describes situations in which a man explains something to a

woman who knows more about it than he does. “Manvising” hasn’t

made it into our lexicon yet, but most women ﬁnd the phenomenon

equally familiar. The term describes moments when men give women

advice that they have neither asked for nor want. Solnit herself provided

this very simple illustration in an article she wrote in 2022: “A few years

ago, a friend of mine got married, and when I pulled up to the rustic
