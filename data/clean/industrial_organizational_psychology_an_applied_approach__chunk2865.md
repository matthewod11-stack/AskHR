## Leadership through Contact: Management by Walking Around

Management by walking around (MBWA) is another popular specific behavioral theory. This one holds that leaders and managers are most effective when they are out of their offices, walking around and meeting with and talking to employees and customers about their needs and progress. Many industry leaders, such as the late Sam Walton of Wal-Mart, have used this approach with great success. MBWA is thought to increase communication, build relationships with employees, and encourage employee participation (Amsbary & Staples, ; Miller, ).

In an interesting series of studies by Komaki and her associates (Komaki, ; Komaki, Zlotnick, & Jensen, ), the behavior of bank managers was observed to determine the differences between effective and ineffective manag- ers. The results of the investigations indicated that the main difference between the two was that effective managers spent more time walking around and moni- toring the behavior and performance of their employees. Empirical evidence thus seems to support the MBWA concept.
