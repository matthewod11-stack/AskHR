# gain from their equity in the business.

This left non-family employees demoralized and created tension among

cousins. When John’s marriage ended, the debate over whether John’s

spouse should stay employed became personal, emotional, and divisive.

It didn’t need to be this way.

- Write down clear expectations around which family members are

eligible for employment, and what qualiﬁcations they need to be

considered for roles.
