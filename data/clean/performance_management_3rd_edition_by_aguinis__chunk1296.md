# Leniency Severity Central tendency

As described in Chapter 6, to minimize the intentional errors shown in Table 7.3, we must focus on the rater’s motivation. In other words, we must demonstrate to the raters that the benefits of providing accurate ratings outweigh the benefits of intention- ally distorting ratings by inflation, deflation, or central tendency. Once again, this goes back to the “What’s in it for me?” question. For example, the communication program should include a clear description of the benefits that supervisors can expect to receive if their performance ratings lack intentional distortion.

RET exposes raters to the different errors and their causes; however, being aware of unintentional errors does not mean that supervisors will no longer make these errors.17Awareness is certainly a good first step, but we need to go further if we want to minimize unintentional errors. One fruitful possibility is the implementation of frame of reference training.
