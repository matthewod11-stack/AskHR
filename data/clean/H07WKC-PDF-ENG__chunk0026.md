## HBR / Digital Article / Can GenAI Do Strategy?

We got a group of MBAs to develop a Blue Ocean strategy proposal

over the course of a week, using traditional paper-based tools, such

as ﬂipcharts, and standard software (Google, PowerPoint). They did

their own research individually and brought their ﬁndings back to

brainstorming meetings. They collectively drew and discussed value

curves — spending as much as three hours agreeing on a single one —

and spent about two days mapping their ecosystems. At the end of this,

they manually put together their PowerPoint presentation — which took

multiple iterations, depending on the team.

At the end of this exercise, we compared the results with what the

AI had come up with. The results were, in fact, quite similar. The AI,

therefore, was clearly competitive. The few diﬀerences that we did ﬁnd,

however, were revealing. For example, the AI had suggested that the

bagel shop might oﬀer limited items for short periods of time, rather as

the fashion chain Zara does. That looked unrealistic at face value, but

when we reﬂected on it, we concluded that it was a promising avenue to

explore. We suspected that the reason the MBA team had not come up

with the idea was an unconscious bias at work, as signaled by the simple

fact that the idea had seemed surprising to us in the ﬁrst place.

The conclusion is rather sobering. An AI was able to produce in just
