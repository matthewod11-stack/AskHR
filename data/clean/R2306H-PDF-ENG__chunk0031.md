## HBR / Magazine Article / Harness Your Network to Unlock Innovation

Innovation catalysts are adept at understanding the problems faced by

others. They can draw a line from the challenge a leader confronts to

the answer, and they can help the leader brainstorm an idea safely

before exploring it further. Not only do their many connections allow

catalysts to tap into a wide range of solutions, but their participation in

in-depth exchanges in community-like settings helps them understand

how those solutions may be applied to novel problems. Because their

ideas tend to be more viable than those from more-isolated individuals,

catalysts help leaders avoid becoming overloaded by a deluge of

suggestions that are unlikely to be workable.
