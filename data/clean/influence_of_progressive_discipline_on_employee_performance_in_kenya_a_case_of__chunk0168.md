# Validity of Instruments

This is the degree to which an instrument measures what is supposed to measure (Kothari, 2004). A content validity test was used to measure instrument validity. The research had purpose to ensure validity of research instruments by using simple language free from jargon that made it easy to be understood by the respondents. The researcher also intended to seek the opinion of individuals who could render intelligent judgment about their adequacy. The researcher also engaged her supervisor and other experts to ensure that the questions tested or measured what they were supposed to measure. The research adopted content validity which refers to the extent to which a measuring instrument provides adequate coverage of the topic under study. The content validity formula by Amin (2005) was used in line with other previous studies (Lefort & Urzua, 2008);the formula is; Content Validity Index = (No. of judges declaring item valid) / (Total no. of items). It is recommended that instruments used in research should have CVI of about 0.78 or higher and three or more experts could be considered evidence of good content validity (Amin, 2005).
