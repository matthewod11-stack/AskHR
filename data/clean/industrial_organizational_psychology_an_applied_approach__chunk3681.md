Coping Skills Improving your coping skills often means learning how to deal with conflict. It also means learning how to accept what you can’t change. I often tell workers who participate in stress management classes that they can’t change the fact that their organizations are downsizing or that restructuring is the trend for today’s companies. Spending energy and time worrying about it or being angry is a waste of time. The best solution for them is to find areas that they can control to meet organizational change. This includes returning to college or taking technical training to make themselves marketable should they be laid off.

This is good advice for you as a college student as well. Worrying about whether you will graduate with a . GPA is both emotionally and physically stressful. Though setting a goal of high achievement is admirable, worrying about it for the entire four years you are in college is unproductive.
