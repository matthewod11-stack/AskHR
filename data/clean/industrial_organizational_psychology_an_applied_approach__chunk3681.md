Support Network Studies show that people who have someone to talk to, like a family member or a friend, are better able to manage their stress. You may have already experienced this. When you feel you aren’t doing well in class, do you talk to someone about your feelings? Do you feel better afterward? Sometimes talking to someone we trust helps put things in perspective. So if you don’t have a good support system, seek one out. This may mean joining certain college groups where you can meet people. Attend campus lectures where meeting friends is possible. And for extreme situations, familiarize yourself with the type of professional help that is available on or off campus that can give you the support you need during stressful times.

Self-Empowerment In Chapter  you learned about empowerment. Most of the literature on empow- erment is approached from an organizational, managerial perspective. That is, the literature explains how management can empower employees by giving them more control over important decisions that affect their lives. This has become important to organizations because research suggests that not having input into matters that affect us can be a big source of stress.

What most of the literature doesn’t discuss is how employees can and need to learn to empower themselves. Ninety percent of workers think employers must

act to reduce stress. But because employees cannot control what organizations do, it is more important for them to find their own ways to reduce stress. This is another form of self-empowerment. In addition, instead of complaining about how they don’t get to participate in organizational decision making, employees need to take the initiative to volunteer to participate in committees or in group projects; this is one way to take back some control they perceive they have lost.

Individuals can also empower themselves in their personal lives. Instead of playing the victim who believes that life has singled him or her out to play dirty tricks on, individuals must learn to find ways to gain control over those situations they can control. This means taking an active role in finding out why something didn’t turn out the way they wanted and making changes to prevent the event from occurring again. Chronic complaining about how everyone mistreats you is, to most people, a behavioral response to what is perceived as lack of control in your life. Most victimization is from learned behavior that we see modeled by family members, friends, coworkers, and even people we don’t know, such as those in the news. To break that behavior, attending workshops on assertiveness and decision making can be beneficial. These types of workshops are often offered through col- leges, churches, and community groups. If you are interested in attending such training, check with your university to see what may be available.
