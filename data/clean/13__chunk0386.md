## The Past, Present, and Future of Dynamic Performance Research

I=The number of units required to produce the ﬁrst unit (e.g., labor hours), or the expected initial performance level. X=The cumulative unit number. N=The learning index; log F/log 2. F=The learning rate. 1–F=The progress ratio.

Other learning curve models include the plateau model (Guibert, 1945), the Sigmoid S Curve (Carr, 1946), the Prior-Learning Model (Stanford Research Institute, 1949), the adaptation function (Levy, 1965), the exponential function (Pegels, 1969); time-rate models (Bemis, 1981), and cost-rate models (Smith, 1981). It is not my purpose here to provide a comprehensive review of all modiﬁcations of the learning curve model; this is a task best left for texts speciﬁcally on this topic (see, Belkaoui, 1986 and Teplitz, 1991). Nonetheless, it is important to at least bring up that a variety of mathematical functions exist, as the use of one of these speciﬁc models may be more appropriate when modeling individual job performance scores.
