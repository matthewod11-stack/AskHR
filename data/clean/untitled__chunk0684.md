# The Philosophical Period 113

Hellenistic and medieval physician-philosophers contin- ued to develop Aristotle’s cognitive psychology. They elab- orated on his list of faculties, adding new ones such as estimation, the faculty by which animals and humans intuit whether a perceived object is beneﬁcial or harmful. More- over, they sought to give faculty psychology a physiological basis. From the medical writings of antiquity, they believed that mental processes are carried out within the various ventricles of the brain containing cerebrospinal ﬂuid. They proposed that each mental faculty was housed in a distinct ventricle of the brain and that the movement of the cere- brospinal ﬂuid through each ventricle in turn was the physical basis of information processing through the faculties. Here is the beginning of cognitive neuroscience and the idea of local- ization of cerebral function.
