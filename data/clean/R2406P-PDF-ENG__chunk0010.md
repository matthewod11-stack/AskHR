# the diﬀerence in my life.

After law school you moved on to clerkships, including one at the Supreme Court, which took a lot of stamina. How did you manage that early part of your career?

It was hard, but I expected it to be. The Supreme Court clerkship was

literally a 24/7 kind of job. But I kept saying to myself, You can do

anything for a year. And cases come to the Supreme Court because they are diﬃcult and extremely consequential—addressing issues that

aﬀect an enormous number of people in very signiﬁcant ways— so our

baseline is that the work will be very challenging and the spotlight of

public attention will be very, very hot. All that creates pressure, which

you then have to balance with self-care. But your commitment is to do

your best to serve your justice and the institution, and it’s going to take

pretty much everything you have for that period.
