## HBR / Magazine Article / Life’s Work: An Interview with Ketanji Brown Jackson

Your stint in corporate law was uncomfortable. Why?

I was pregnant when I entered it, and the uncomfortable thing was

being thrust immediately into wanting to perform at the highest level

as a new employee in this environment but at times feeling as though

I wouldn’t be able to do that once my daughter was born. Someone

had to get home to relieve the nanny, and my husband was a surgical

resident at Mass General at the time, so more often than not, that person

was me. It was an identity crisis. I had built my professional brand

around being a hard worker, staying however long, doing whatever was

necessary, and not being able to do that was very, very challenging. I

also felt inadequate in the parenting realm because I had to go to work

and wasn’t there for my baby.

How did you resolve that conﬂict?

I ended up shifting from the big law ﬁrm and trying diﬀerent things.

I went to a small mediation ﬁrm. I went to the government. When

my kids were a bit older, I went back into big law, but ultimately

got on the Sentencing Commission, an agency of the judiciary that

helps set sentencing policy for federal judges. The schedule was much

better. Doing work that I considered to be meaningful was also helpful.

When I felt like I was really making a diﬀerence, the sacriﬁces on the

motherhood front felt more worth it.

How have you and your husband managed the push and pull of two high-powered careers?

My husband has always seen this as a partnership. He is so self-

sacriﬁcing in parenting, caring for our household and my career. Early

on, when we were ﬁrst married, before we had kids, we would take

turns. He took some time oﬀ in the residency to do research in DC so

that I could work at the law ﬁrm I wanted. Then I went back up to

Boston so that he could ﬁnish his residency. One of us would step back

to let the other do what was needed for work. And that’s the way we have

managed our lives ever since. Now, during the Supreme Court term,
