# Orchestration

With the foundational components in place, you can consider orchestration patterns to enable) your agent to execute work(cid:25)ows e(cid:16)ectively(cid:14)

While it’s tempting to immediately build a fully autonomous agent with complex architecture, customers typically achieve greater success with an incremental approach.(

In general, orchestration patterns fall into two categories:

01

Single-agent systems, where a single model equipped with appropriate tools and instructions executes work0ows in a loop

02

Multi-agent systems, where work0ow execution is distributed across multiple coordinated agents

Let’s explore each pattern in detail.
