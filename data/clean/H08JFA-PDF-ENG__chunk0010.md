Based on my insights and research for my book Toxic Productivity:

Reclaim your time and emotional energy in a world that always demands

more, there are three emotional dynamics that can lead you to

overcommitting in the workplace that impact how you feel or behave.

- 1. Desire for validation (especially from managers): You might be

taking on more than you can manage as you may have a strong need

to be recognized and valued and depend on external validation to see

the value of your work. But this dependence on other people’s opinion

may prevent you from developing important skills. For instance,

instead of seeing feedback as an opportunity for growth, you might

interpret it as a criticism of your value as an employee and feel

anxious instead of learning from it. Or you might not attempt new

projects or tasks at work, preferring to stay in your comfort zone,

instead of risking mistakes or failure.

- 2. Fear of rejection and failure: You might fear potentially

disappointing colleagues or being perceived as incapable. This fear

can push you to accept tasks beyond your capacity or capability,

believing that saying “no” will harm your reputation or career
