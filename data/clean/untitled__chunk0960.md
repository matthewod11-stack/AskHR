# THEMES IN A MODERN HISTORY OF EMOTION

Modern concerns with problems of emotion date from the publication of William James’s and Carl Lange’s papers. William James’s major contribution to psychology in his the- ory of emotion really had very little to do with the problem of emotion as such. At the end of the nineteenth century, psy- chology was still obsessed with its own “atomic” theory. Complex ideas and thoughts were made up of nuclear ideas, feelings, and thoughts. We ﬁnd this fundamental notion in Wundt just as much as we found it in John Locke. If anything characterizes modern theoretical attitudes, it is an approach common to practically all of the various schools, trends, and points of view. Nearly all would subscribe to the notion that the role of modern psychology is to describe the processes and mechanisms that produce thoughts, ideas, actions, and feelings. Whether the stress is on the production of these “mental” events or on the production of behavior and action, the important point is that the basic building blocks are theo- retical mechanisms and processes rather than atomic, unde- ﬁned mental contents. It was William James who promoted the change from the content to a process approach. It is this approach that motivated his insistence that emotional con- sciousness is “not a primary feeling, directly aroused by the exciting object or thought, but a secondary feeling indirectly aroused” (James, 1894, p. 516), though he does consider as primary the “organic changes . . . which are immediate re- ﬂexes following upon the presence of the object” (p. 516). He contrasts his position with that of Wundt, who insisted that a feeling (Gefühl) was an unanalyzable and simple process corresponding to a sensation.

The fundamental distinction between feeling or emotion as a secondary derivative process and the view that feelings are unanalyzable provides one of the main themes running
