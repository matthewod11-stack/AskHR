# Teaching Resilience for the Long Haul

Remember, layoﬀs are common. This may be your ﬁrst time handling

one, or maybe you’ve been here before. Think back on your own

childhood: Do you remember one of your parents being laid oﬀ? If you

do, you probably remember how your family handled it. Now consider

your own children: How will they remember this experience? While no

one expects to look back on a layoﬀ fondly, this season doesn’t have to

sink an individual or devastate a family. But in fact, the experience can

be used to bind your family closer together and teach valuable lessons.

It’s an opportunity to model grit, resilience, positivity, and

perseverance. Having to model these traits might even make you feel

them yourself, and that can even help you land your next job.
