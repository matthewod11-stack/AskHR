Let me suggest a way to start. Of every action you take as an HRleader, ask this simple question: does it cause friction in thebusiness or does it create flow? Friction is anything that makes itmore difficult for people in critical roles to win with the customer.Flow, on the other hand, is doing everything possible to removebarriers and promote better performance. The question applies tovirtually any company in any business and it will take you fartherdown the road faster than the hazy, abstract injunction to becomea strategic partner. Even in what appear to be routine HRresponsibilities, you can inject the business perspective simply byasking whether what you are doing is going to enhance the flow ofthe business or impede it with friction.Why is it so difficult to inject that business perspective? Becauseas HR leaders we feel ourselves to be near the pinnacle of theorganization. The organization reports to us. It must meet ourdemands for information, documents, numbers.In fact, thatâ€™s backwards. We are far removed from the points andpeople that make a difference with customers and a difference tothe business. Our perspective should be that of seeing to it thatthe people at those points can perform as smoothly, productively,and frictionlessly as possible.Think, for example, of your talent strategy. Do you simply managetalent, or do you provide talent solutions that reduce friction andenhance the flow of the business? Often we pride ourselves ontrying to recruit the best talent we can find and consistently andfairly spending our resources and focusing our attention equallyon everyone. But does that really enhance the flow of thebusiness?
