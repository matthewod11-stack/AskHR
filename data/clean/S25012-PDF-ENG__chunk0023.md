## novo antibodies with a computer and zero-shot generative AI—in which

a machine-learning model recognizes and classiﬁes new concepts

without having any labeled examples. In other words the AI designs

antibodies that will bind to speciﬁc targets without using any training

data on antibodies known to bind those targets. Creating them via AI

instead of through trial and error could reduce the time it takes to get

new biologics into the clinic from as much as six years down to 18

months, while increasing their probability of success. Waste, as kaizen

has taught us, is not only a matter of materials but also a matter of time and eﬀort.
