# What Can Be Done?

Perhaps the greatest need in this area today, as in the past, is for methodologically sound evaluations of the rel- ative impact of alternative OD interventions. Problems such as the unit of analysis and random assignment of individuals to groups make classic experimental designs difficult to implement in field settings. This should not be cause for abandonment of efforts to evaluate the rel- ative impact of alternative interventions. Application of quasi-experimental designs, qualitative research methods (Van Maanen, 1979), and assessment of the agreement of laboratory and field results (Gersick, 1989) all can contribute to the advancement of knowledge and practice. Thousands of change efforts are initiated every year. If the field is to maintain a scientific basis for its continued existence, then it is essential to evaluate change efforts to determine which interventions have the greatest impact on which organizational variables. The ultimate objective is to develop cumulative knowledge that can be translated into a science-based practice of OD that is directly useful to organizations. Such knowledge will be critical to mas- tering change at all levels and ensuring a sustained com- petitive advantage for organizations that rely on behav- ioral science-based change interventions to do so.
