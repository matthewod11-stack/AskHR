activities for Health Care are maintained in the blockchain. All users have secure authentication using either there ID Card or the Mobile Number. It is used to perform digital timestamp of the records and stored securely through cryptographic hashing.As mentioned in in [5], the digital hash of the document is stored the Permissioned Blockchain using KSI technology.

- 9. Summary The literature review focusses on an objective

assessment of the potential use cases of Blockchain in Government, the categorization of the Use Cases based on the functionality, and then a subjective framework that helps identify the best Blockchain framework to be applied based on the application Use Case. The applicability of the same has been verified through real world scenarios. There can be further research done on the same to extend the Blockchain categorization based on Consensus Protocols underlying the Blockchain technology.
