them-from allowing very rapid growth of promising business. One barrier might

be the psychology of managers of conventional businesses who compete with the

rapidly growing new business units. Loss-aversion and social comparison suggest

that managers in traditional businesses will be uncomfortable about seeing lots of cash poured into businesses which could outgrow their own.’ The managerial psy-

chology which creates empire building probably also encourages suppression of

growing empires within the firm.
