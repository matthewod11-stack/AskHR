# I–Opsychologyandworkplacedecisions

efforts can be extremely valuable, but how one moves from case-by-case experiences to institutionalizing the cross fertilization escapes me.

Scott Highhouse: I am going to answer this question a little differently. think IOOB researchers and practitioners could learn from JDM how to apply psychology inﬂuences everyday deci- in a way that sions and large-scale policy making (see Thaler & Sunstein, 2008). One need only look through past issues of the journal Psy- chologicalScienceto see that JDM research attacks big questions, presents hypotheses that challenge conventional wisdom, and generally makes us think differently about things (e.g., Schkade & Kahneman, 1998). As a former associate editor of OBHDP, I noticed that JDM reviewers placed con- siderable emphasis on the creativity with which authors approached a research ques- IOOB reviewers, on tion. the other hand, were often more con- cerned with evaluating the conventions of research design and analysis. Of course, this is a very general impression, and there are many exceptions on both sides. Never- theless, I believe that IOOB scholars could place more emphasis onthe development of hypotheses that surprise and even entertain (cf., Lee, Frederick, & Ariely, 2006).
