# ABSTRACT

Most employees need motivation to feel good about their jobs and perform optimally. Some

employees are financially motivated while others find recognition and rewards personally

motivating. Motivation levels within the workplace have a direct impact on employee

productivity. Workers who are motivated and excited about their jobs carry out their

responsibilities to the best of their ability as a result, production numbers. Employee

motivation has always been a central problem for leaders and managers. Unmotivated

employees are likely to spend little or no effort in their jobs, avoid the workplace as much

as possible, exit the organization if given the opportunity and produce low quality work.

On the other hand, employees who feel motivated to work are likely to be persistent,

creative and productive, turning out high quality work that they willingly undertake. There

has been a lot of research done on motivation by many scholars. Employers need to get

to know their employees very well and use different tactics to motivate each of them based on

their personal wants and needs. In this paper we would like to emphasis on the importance

of motivation in the workplace to improve the employee performance and productivity. Even

we would like to present the theories and techniques of the motivation in the workplace.
