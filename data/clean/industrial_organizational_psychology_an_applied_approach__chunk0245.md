## An Instructor’s Manual to Make Teaching Easier!

Th e instructor’s manual will make teaching I/O psychology easier by providing help in three areas: constructing tests, grading student exercises, and deliver- ing classroom lectures. To help in constructing tests, the instructor’s manual contains multiple-choice and short-answer test questions for each chapter. Multiple-choice items are also included in an electronic test bank known as ExamView®.

To help in grading student exercises, the instructor’s manual contains the answers to exercises for which there are objective answers. Th is section also contains information to help interpret the psychological tests in the text. Psychological tests in the textbook section include:
