# Psychological Exams

In jobs involving public safety (e.g., law enforcement, nuclear power, transporta- tion), it is common for employers to give psychological exams to applicants after a conditional offer of hire has been made. If the applicant fails the exam, the offer is rescinded. Psychological exams usually consist of an interview by a clinical psy- chologist, an examination of the applicantâ€™s life history, and the administration of one or more of the psychological tests discussed earlier in this chapter. It is important to keep in mind that psychological exams are not designed to predict employee performance. Therefore, they should only be used to determine if a potential employee is a danger to himself or others.
