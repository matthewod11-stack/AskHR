# HBR / Digital Article / 6 Common Leadership Styles — and How to Decide Which to Us…

This is how switching styles looks in real life: When launching a new

project, you would use an authoritative style where clear direction and

a compelling vision are needed to bring the team together and inspire

people toward a common goal. You would switch to a coaching style

when an employee is struggling with a certain task and you need to

help them learn a new skill. And you would employ a pacesetting style

when your team of driven and experienced employees needs to meet a

challenging deadline.

But what if you feel like you’re not equipped to take on a new and

diﬀerent leadership style — let alone more than one?

Goleman says that anyone can expand their range of leadership

styles through dedicated practice and repetition. He also recommends

focusing on growing your emotional intelligence, “To expand [their

style repertories], leaders must ﬁrst understand which emotional

intelligence competencies underlie the leadership styles they are

lacking,” he writes in his 2000 HBR article. “They can then

work assiduously to increase their quotient of them. For instance, an aﬃliative leader has strengths in three emotional intelligence

competencies: in empathy, in building relationships, and in

communication… Such advice about adding capabilities may seem

simplistic — ‘Go change yourself’ — but enhancing emotional

intelligence is entirely possible with practice.”

. . .

The good news is that personality is not destiny. Even if you’re naturally

introverted or you tend to be driven by data and analysis rather than

emotion, you can still learn how to adapt diﬀerent leadership styles to

organize, motivate, and direct your team.
