## Part I • Strategic and General Considerations

by the industrial organization perspective from economics. This perspective argues that a firm must first agree on a strategy (e.g., low cost or differentiation), and then subsequently decide on goals. These two alternative sequences, strategies → goals versus goals → strategies, were contrasted against each other in a study involving the heads of purchasing and manufacturing of more than 100 manufacturing companies in Spain. Results suggested that the strategies → goals sequence was superior in terms of predicting firm performance. In sum, it is beneficial for the cascading of strategic planning to first have units agree on common strategies before they agree on what goals will be set to reach those strategic priorities.20
