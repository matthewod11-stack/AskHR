# MOTIVATION AND EMOTION

Physiological and neural mechanisms of motivation and emotion have been a particular province of biological psy- chology and physiology in the twentieth century. In more re- cent years, the ﬁelds of motivation and emotion have tended to go separate ways (see Brown, 1961, 1979). However mo- tivation and emotion have common historical origins. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, instinct doctrine served as the explanation for why organisms were driven to behave (at least infrahuman organisms without souls). Darwin’s emphasis on the role of adaptive behavior in evolutionary survival resulted in the extension of instinct doctrine to human behavior. Major sources of impetus for this were Freud’s and McDougall’s notions of instinctive human moti- vation. Watson rebelled violently against the notion of in- stinct and rejected it out of hand, together with all biological mechanisms of motivation. As Lashley (1938) put it, he “threw out the baby with the bath.”
