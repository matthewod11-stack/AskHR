# 56 Biological Psychology

learning were developing. In 1953, Krech and Rosenzweig began a collaborative study of relationships between brain chemistryandbehavior.Krechdidclassicearlyworkinanimal learning (under his earlier name, Kreshevsky) and was a col- leagueofandcollaboratorwithTolman.MarkRosenzweigre- ceived his PhD in physiological psychology at Harvard in 1949 and joined the psychology department at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1951. Soon after they began their joint work in 1953 they were joined by E. L. Bennett and later byM.C.Diamond.Theirinitialstudiesconcernedbrainlevels of AChE in relation to the hypothesis behavior and included analysis of strain differences (see Krech, Rosenzweig, & Bennett, 1960). More recently, they discovered the striking differences in the brains of rats raised in “rich” versus “poor” environments.WilliamGreenough(1984),attheUniversityof Illinois,replicatedandextendedthisworktodemonstratedra- maticmorphologicalchangesinthestructuresofsynapsesand neurons as a result of experience.

The use of model biological systems has been an impor- tant tradition in the study of neural mechanisms of learning. This approach has been particularly successful in the analysis of habituation, itself a very simple form or model of learning. Sherrington did important work on ﬂexion reﬂex “fatigue” in the spinal animal at the turn of the century. In 1936, Prosser and Hunter completed a pioneering study comparing habitu- ation of startle response in intact rats and habituation of hindlimb ﬂexion reﬂex in spinal rats. They established, for habituation, the basic approach of Sherrington, namely that spinal reﬂexes can serve as models of neural-behavioral processes in intact animals. Sharpless and Jasper (1956) es- tablished habituation as an important process in EEG activity. Modern Russian inﬂuences have been important in this ﬁeld—the key studies of Evgeny Sokolov (1963), ﬁrst on habituation of the orienting response in humans and more re- cently on mechanisms of habituation of responses in the sim- pliﬁed nervous system of the snail.

The deﬁning properties of habituation were clearly estab- lished by Thompson and Spencer in 1966, and the analysis of mechanisms began. Several laboratories using different preparations—Aplysia withdrawal reﬂex; Kandel and his many associates (see Kandel, 1976); vertebrate spinal re- ﬂexes; Thompson, Spencer, Farel; crayﬁsh tail ﬂip escape; Krasne (1969), Kennedy—all arrived at the same underlying synaptic mechanism—a decrease in the probability of trans- mitter release from presynaptic terminals of the habituating pathway. Habituation is thus a very satisfying ﬁeld; agree- ment ranges from deﬁning behavioral properties to synaptic mechanisms. In a sense, the problem has been solved. Habituation also provides a most successful example of the use of the model biological systems approach to analysis of

neural mechanisms of behavioral plasticity (see Groves & Thompson, 1970).

Special mention must be made of the elegant and detailed studies by Eric Kandel and his many associates on long- lasting neuronal plasticity in the Aplysia gill-withdrawal circuit (Kandel, 1976; Hawkins, Kandel, & Siegelbaum, 1993). This simpliﬁed model system (together with work on the hippocampus) made it possible to elucidate putative processes that result in long-lasting synaptic plasticity, for example, biochemical models of memory formation and stor- age. Eric was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 2000 in part for this work.
