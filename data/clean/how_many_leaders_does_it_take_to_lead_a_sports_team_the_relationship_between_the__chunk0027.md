## Athlete Leadership and Team Effectiveness

Intention to continue. To value each player’s choice of remaining with the same team, coach or teammates, the players responded to three questions [30]; “Would you like to con- tinue next year (1) on the same team?; (2) ... with the same coach?; and (3) ...with the same teammates?” Responses were made on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

Perceived team performance. To assess perceived team performance, we assessed the

players’ subjective perception through a single-item scale, which was previously used by Dithurbide et al. [44]. More specifically, players were asked to rate their team’s performance on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Although, single-item scales have been criticized, some authors have argue that this type of measure has greater ecological valid- ity [45, 46].
