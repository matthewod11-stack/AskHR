## Chapter 1 • Performance Management and Reward Systems in Context

differences within the base pay range may exist based on such variables as experience and differential performance. In some countries (e.g., United States), there is a differ- ence between wage and salary. Salary is base cash compensation received by employees who are exempt from regulations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and, in most cases, cannot receive overtime pay. Employees in most professional and managerial jobs (also called salaried employees) are exempt employees. On the other hand, nonexempt employees receive their pay calculated on an hourly wage.
