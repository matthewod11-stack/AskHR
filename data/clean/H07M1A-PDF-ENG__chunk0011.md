Once I conﬁrmed a project, I knew it was my job to communicate

proactively. As a remote consultant, I needed to let management know

that I was abreast of my work while also making meaningful

connections with the team I was working with. In addition, that

ensured that I received up-to-the-minute information. When you are

not physically present, it is easy for others to forget they need to

communicate directives beyond their four walls. I needed to stay on

people’s radars and demonstrate reliability. A good result with one

client would naturally lead to a subsequent referral.

The same issues can also aﬀect a corporate remote employee. When you

don’t have the luxury of proximity, it’s easy to get left behind and feel a sense of loneliness. Remote employees need to make a greater eﬀort

to actively participate in the company culture than people physically in

the oﬃce. That means they, too, need to communicate proactively and sometimes overcommunicate, while also making a concerted eﬀort to have virtual coﬀees with teammates.

Hybrid employees that straddle in-person and remote life typically have

the bulk of the meeting load crammed into their in-oﬃce days. That requires them to balance their relationship-building eﬀorts and focus

on more than just the colleagues they physically see.
