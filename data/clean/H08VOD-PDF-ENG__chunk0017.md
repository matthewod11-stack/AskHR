# growth, both for them and for her.

- 3. Can I deﬁne what must be true for the decision to succeed without making it myself? This question closes the loop. Can you articulate the success criteria so

that someone else can take action conﬁdently?

Laura realized she didn’t need to pick product features. Clarifying the

roadmap and what success would look like allowed her directors to

make the ﬁnal call—and explain it back.

If you’re still hesitant, ask yourself: Is there anything beyond my

answers to these three questions that would prevent me from delegating

this decision successfully? If yes, name it. If not, let go.

When Laura began to delegate decision-making, her team was surprised

at ﬁrst—and then energized. With clear criteria and new authority, they

stepped up and owned more decisions on their own. Laura stayed in the

loop, but was no longer in the way.

. . .

When you let go of the right decisions, you don’t lose control—you

extend it. You turn decision-making into a shared capability. You

become not just a leader of work, but a leader of leaders.
