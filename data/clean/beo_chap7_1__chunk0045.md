children coloring pictures (with no extrinsic incentive). Then they paid the children a

small sum of money for each picture colored. When the wage was later removed, the

children colored fewer pictures than they had in the initial phase with no payments.

Their interpretation, called “overjustification,” is that the children infer something

paid for coloring, they infer that they must not like to color very much, so when the

wage is removed they quit coloring pictures.

Kreps (1997) and Benabou and Tirole (2003) consider crowding-out from an

economic point of view. Since incentives often do have positive effects, the challenge
