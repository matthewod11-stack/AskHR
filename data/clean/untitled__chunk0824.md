## Cattell’s Theory of Fluid and Crystallized Abilities

More widely accepted than any of the previous theories is that of Raymond Cattell (1971), which is somewhat similar to Vernon’s theory. This theory proposes general ability at the top of the hierarchy and two abilities immediately beneath it, ﬂuid ability, or gf, and crystallized ability, or gc. Fluid ability is the ability to think ﬂexibly and to reason abstractly. It is measured by tests such as number series and ﬁgural analo- gies. Crystallized ability is the accumulated knowledge base one has developed over the course of one’s life as the result of the application of ﬂuid ability. It is measured by tests such as vocabulary and general information.

More recent work has suggested that ﬂuid ability is ex- tremely difﬁcult to distinguish statistically from general abil- ity(Gustafsson,1984,1988).Indeed,thetestsusedtomeasure ﬂuid ability are often identical to the tests used to measure whatissupposedtobepureg.Anexampleofsuchatestwould

be the Raven Progressive Matrices (Raven, Court, & Raven, 1992), which measures people’s ability to ﬁll in a missing part of a matrix comprising abstract ﬁgural drawings.

Horn (1994) has greatly expanded upon the hierarchical theory as originally proposed by Cattell. Most notably, he has suggested that g can be split into three more factors nested under ﬂuid and crystallized abilities. These three other fac- tors are visual thinking (gv), auditory thinking (ga), and speed (gs). The visual thinking factor is probably closer to Vernon’s k:m factor than it is to the ﬂuid ability factor.
