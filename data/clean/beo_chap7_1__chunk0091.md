## 7.3.4.1 Culture as Focal Principles and Correlating Devices

Kreps (1990) introduced the idea of an organization’s culture as a correlating device

(see also Camerer and Vepsdldinen 1988). In this view, cultural rules are meta-

principles which tell workers what to do in the face of unforeseen contingencies,

in the spirit of Schelling’s (1960) focal points in matching games, but extended to

meta-principles which prescribe focal points in an ensemble of games.

The idea is illustrated by Figure 7.1, an advertisement from a Southwest Airlines

in-flight magazine. This shows a hypothetical quiz given to potential employees

about how to react to a customer’s problem. A company’s culture can be thought

of as a set of general recipes which help workers and managers coordinate on the

“right” answer in quizzes like this, which correspond to workplace incidents. At

Southwest Airlines, the correct answer is get some baby formula for the delayed

passenger and pick up a coloring book as well. The example gains force from the

fact that it is based on a true story. The point of the ad is that Southwest Airlines is

deeply customer-oriented (note that the term “Customer” is capitalized).
