The process or performance appraisal aries from a series of informal assessments made by superiors who know their staff well to more structured systems which require superiors to complete various forms and make written Lomments. Many authorities contend that well-designed performanLe appraisal sytems are essential in effectively and legally managing human resources.

In reality, however, few systems are totally successful. One reason is that superiors have great difficulty writing useful and objective performance appraisal reports. They are often reluctant to criticize a subordinates work and put the LritiLism in writing. Another problem is there is no single approach that can fully addiess all the purposes that organizations attempt to achieve with performance appiaisal. As for equal oppor- tunity considerations, many systems used today are not the solution but, rather, are part of the problem. A number of studies have shown Li 'tenon bias to be a serious short- coming, resulting in discrimination against blacks, ethnic minorities, and women. These systems may produce ratings that are subjeLtive, impres,ionistic, non-job-related, and unstandardized. When used to justify important personnel decisions, such ratings increase rather than decrease Equal Employ ment Opportunity (EEO) liability.

Fortunately, the failures of the past have led to increa.,ed emphasis on development of raters, more realistic expectations of what performance appraisal can accomplish, workable appraisal techniques, and effective strategies to deal with EEO regulations. Examples of effective performance appraisal systems can be found in all types of organizations including educational institutions. Turning die potential of performance appraisal into productive reality is a challenge but attainah.e goal facing those who manage the affairs of postsecondary education.

With few exceptions, both faculty and administrators approach the performance appraisal process with some level of anxiety and apprehension. The editors have made a concerted effort in this book to relieve some of this anxiety by presenting the most pertinent information which will increase the understanding of basic knowledge that makes any performance appraisal system workable, fair to all parties, and legally defen- sible. While the editors recognize that many facets were omitted that could have been included, to do so would have made it unnecessarily long.

This book is not intended to be a substitute for primary sources in the field, rather, it is meant to provide a concise framework for understanding the basic concepts of per- formance appraisal and serve as a functional tool for practitioners and scholars. In addition, our hook is not designed to render legal advice or lcgal opinion. Such advice may only be given by ]lensed, practicing attorney, and only when related to actual fact situations. This warning is particularly pertinent because of the nature of the topics covered herein. Specific legal questions concerning personnel performance appraisal should always be checked with the appropriate legal counsel.
