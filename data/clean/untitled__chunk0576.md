The study of sensation and perception is diverse. Partly this is the result of the length of time that perceptual problems have been studied. The Greek philosophers, the pre-Renaissance thinkers, the Arabic scholars, the Latin Scholastics, the early British empiricists, the German physicists, and the German physicians who founded both physiology and psychology considered issues in sensation and perception to be basic questions. When Alexander Bain wrote the ﬁrst English text- book on psychology in 1855 it was entitled The Senses and the Intellect, with the most extensive coverage reserved for sensory and perceptual functions. During the ﬁrst half of his career, the major portion of both the theorizing and the em- pirical work of Wilhelm Wundt (who is generally credited with the founding of experimental psychology) were oriented toward sensation and perception.

The long history of sensory and perceptual research means that there is a huge database and that much information has accrued about the substantive issues concerning how the spe- ciﬁc sensory systems operate and how we extract and inter- pret information from them. It would be possible to write a book just on the history of visual perception, or another on auditory perception, or yet another on the history of sensory and perceptual studies of the tactile, olfactory, or gustatory modalities. Even speciﬁc aspects of perception, such as the perception of pain, could generate its own full volume out- lining the history of the major substantive ﬁndings and theo- retical treatments of this single aspect of sensory experience. In addition to the large empirical database that has resulted from the long history of research in this area, the study of
