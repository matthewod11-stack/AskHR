# Business Ethics Theory

Business Ethics Theory focuses on the rights and wrongs in the business. In understanding the right and wrong in the business ethics theory, Crane and Matten (2007) injected morality that is concerned with the norms, values and beliefs fixed in the social process which defines right and wrong for an individual or social community. Crane and Matten (2007) define ethics as the study of morality and the application of reason which sheds light on rules and principle which is called ethical theories that ascertain the right

and the wrong for a situation. Businesses are major provider of jobs, products and services and as such demands are placed on the management and governance making their work more challenging and complex as there are compromises to be made. Business ethics helps to identify benefits and problems associated with ethical issues within the organization and it is important as it gives a new light into present and traditional view of ethics (Crane and Matten 2007)

According to Purcell (1987), business aim to achieve prosperity, growth and survival. Ideally success should benefit all the stakeholders in the organization such as owners, management, customers, employees and suppliers. There may be tension between accomplishing business and social and ethical obligations of an organization. An ethical approach will be based high commitment and high involvement policies. The commitment will be mutual and arrangement for involvement will be genuine i.e. management will be prepared not only to listen but to act on the views expressed by employees or if it cannot take action, the reasons explained. It will also be transparent and attempt will be made to maintain full employment policies.

Keasey & Wright (2005) in analyzing code of conduct, distinguish the decision making, the structures and process associated with the production, control and accountability which in turn involve the monitoring, evaluation and control of organizational agents to ensure they act in the interest of all stakeholders and in an ethical manner. From the understanding of ethics, it can be noted that different systems of code of conduct will embody what are of considered
