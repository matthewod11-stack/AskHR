whether initial performance improvements of the feedback recipients were sustained or increased over time, whether performance improvement was related to the frequency of feedback and if the discrepancy between self and subordinate ratings was reduced over time.

Reilly et al. (1996) found that the managers who were rated low by their subordinates at the initial feedback administration were consistently rated higher at each subsequent administration but managers who were rated high initially received lower ratings in subsequent reports. The researchers emphasise that the improvement experienced by the lower rated managers is much greater than the decline experienced by managers who were rated higher initially, which demonstrates that there was an overall real improvement in performance over time. Therefore, they found support for their first question.
