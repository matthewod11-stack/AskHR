# Be curious and facilitative

Early in my corporate career as a trainer, people told me that I was

visibly nervous during sessions I was leading. I explained to my boss

that I was worried about not having answers to participants’ questions.

Her response: “What if your role isn’t to have all the answers but to

facilitate the expertise in the room?” This changed my perspective.

Like trainers, leaders can’t be expected to have all the answers. But they

do need to have patience and curiosity and ask insightful questions to

facilitate learning. For example: What has your current approach been?

Can you apply past experience to this problem? What is this situation

teaching you?

Finally, practice compassion and grace. This doesn’t mean tolerating

poor eﬀort or careless mistakes. Instead, it means oﬀering

understanding and accommodation in the face of someone not doing

something exactly how you would do it.

Valerie’s approach that day with our CEO didn’t feel good at the time.

But had she intervened, I wouldn’t have learned how to respond to

unexpected questions or later reﬂected on how to better prepare for

executive presentations. If she’d followed up with advice, I wouldn’t

have discovered my own authentic ways of improving. To this day,

I credit her with helping me to develop the ability to present calmly

in high-stakes situations. She’s also the reason I have the courage to

delegate to colleagues and team members even if it means watching
