# 3.3.1. Data validity and reliability

In her data collection, Tenhiälä made a considerable effort to ensure external validity of the data by sufficient variation in observations. Yet, since some aspects of the research context were unique, it may be problematic to entirely separate universal and context-specific phenomena. This may cause a possible threat to the external validity.

Next, the response rate of 49.5% represents the data’s high internal validity. However, the dependence on cross-sectional data gathered mostly from one source creates a potential threat to the degree to which causal relationships can be established between constructs. Furthermore, all results were subjected to the possibility of common method bias and did not describe changes in employee attitudes before and after the implementation of a new pay system (Salimäki, 2009).

With the aim of increasing construct validity, the variables were adopted from existing, validated operationalisations. They were thus appropriate for the operational measures. However, it is important to acknowledge that some of the survey constructs have yet to be validated in the Finnish language. Also, the research relied on employees as a source of information about their own behaviours and the effectiveness of the pay practice, which, in turn, is a threat to the studies’ construct validity.
