# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

cognitive and affective trust to a similar extent and no significant differences were found in

these main effects (see Table 2).

The relative effects of the leadership styles on cognitive and affective trust over

transformational leadership are shown in Table 3. The relative weights analysis highlights

differences across the two bases of trust, supporting Hypothesis 2. Specifically,

transformational leadership is the dominant predictor of cognitive trust and thus explains a

larger amount of variance compared to all other leadership styles. However, for affective

trust, ethical leadership (63.17) and servant leadership (56.86) explained more variance

compared to transformational leadership. As was the case for overall trust in the leader, we

also conducted relative weights analysis comparing the associations between servant, ethical,

authentic and abusive leadership to cognitive and affective trust in the leader. For cognitive

trust in the leader, authentic leadership showed the largest contribution (34.92%), whereas

ethical leadership had the largest association with affective trust (34.38%).

As shown in Table 4, the incremental predictive validity analysis highlights that

servant, ethical, and authentic leadership showed modest incremental predictive validity over

transformational leadership for cognitive trust. Each of these styles demonstrated an 11%

increase in the variance explained above transformational leadership. Empowering leadership

accounted for an additional 9% variance in cognitive trust over transformational leadership,

while abusive supervision showed no evidence of incremental validity. Both servant and

ethical leadership predicted affective trust to a greater extent than transformational

leadership, accounting for 31% and 30% additional variance respectively. Authentic

leadership accounted for an additional 22% of the variance of affective trust.

In terms of predicting performance outcomes, both cognitive and affective trust have

significant correlations with performance and OCB (see Table 6). Furthermore, as shown in
