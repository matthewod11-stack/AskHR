based them on advice from members who had less expertise than he

did.

The most successful leaders and teams rarely get stuck. That’s what we

found in our study of 258 virtual teams that were competing to develop

ideas for a new start-up. We ran that competition with help from the

Stanford Graduate School of Business, which provided the funding for

the prizes. Leading venture capitalists judged the teams’ performance.

We discovered that teams that routinely shifted between “one person

clearly takes the lead” and “we all participate equally” outperformed

those that operated in just one of those modes.

In another study we conducted a randomized experiment with 150

temporary teams made up of senior executives from a wide range of

companies. The leaders of 50 teams maintained a traditional hierarchy,

the leaders of another 50 created a ﬂat hierarchy, and those heading

the remaining 50 alternated between the two—they gave members time

to voice their opinions and ideas but then stepped in and asserted

authority when needed. The teams played a simulation game in which

members climbed Mount Everest together. They were evaluated on

the quality of their decisions—such as when to start and end the

daily climb, whether to climb that day at all, and how to allocate

oxygen to team members—many of which required them to synthesize

information held by diﬀerent members. Here again the teams that

alternated modes performed much better than the others, making
