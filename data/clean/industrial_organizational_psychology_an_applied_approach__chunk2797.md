# Task Orientation

As depicted in Figure ., theoretically, person-oriented leaders should have satisfied employees, whereas task-oriented leaders should have productive employees. Leaders scoring high in both (called team leadership) should have satisfied and productive employees, whereas leaders scoring low in both (called impoverished leadership) should have unhappy and unproductive employees (Fleishman & Harris, ; Hutchison, Valentino, & Kirkner, ; Korman, ; Pool, ).

Although these predictions certainly make sense, the meta-analysis by Judge and his colleagues () found that consideration scores (person orientation) were more strongly correlated with follower satisfaction, follower motivation, and ratings of leadership effectiveness than were initiating structure scores (task orientation). Correlations with the performance of the work group were similar in magnitude for both consideration and initiating structure.

To complicate matters further, the relationship between person and task orientation is probably more complex than was first thought. Several studies have shown that leader experience and knowledge and such external variables as time pressures and work importance tend to moderate the relationship between per- son-orientation scores and satisfaction and between task-orientation scores and subordinate performance. To find your own level of task orientation, complete Section C of Exercise . in your workbook.

Unsuccessful Leaders The traits and behaviors of unsuccessful leaders are not necessarily the opposite of those of successful leaders (Hackman & Wageman, ). In a departure from research to identify characteristics of successful leaders, Hogan () attempted to identify traits of unsuccessful leaders. Hogan was interested in investigat- ing poor leaders because, according to both empirical research and anecdotal accounts, most employees report that one of the greatest sources of stress in their jobs is their supervisors’ poor performance, strange behavior, or both. This find- ing should come as no surprise: You can probably quickly recall many examples of poor performance or strange behavior with current or former supervisors.

Lack of Training. On the basis of years of research, Hogan () concluded that poor leader behavior has three major causes. The first is a lack of leadership training given to supervisors. The armed forces are among the few organizations that require supervisors to complete leadership training before taking charge of groups of people. The norm for most organizations, however, is either to promote a current employee or hire a new employee and place him directly into

a leadership role. If training is ever provided, it is usually after the promotion and well after the supervisor has begun supervising. The serious consequences of this lack of training can best be understood if we imagine allowing doctors to perform surgery without training or truck drivers to drive on the highways without first learning how to drive.

Cognitive Deficiencies. The second cause of poor leadership stems from cognitive deficiencies. Hogan () believes that poor leaders are unable to learn from experience and are unable to think strategically—they consistently make the same mistakes and do not plan ahead. Support for this concept comes from the meta- analysis by Judge et al. (), which found a significant relationship between cognitive ability and leader performance.

The manager of a local convenience store that I frequent is an example of a person who does not learn from his mistakes. The manager did not give employ- ees their work schedules until one or two days before they had to work. The employees complained because the hours always changed and they could not schedule their personal, family, and social lives. But the manager continued to do it his way, and most of the employees quit. Eight years later, he still does it his way, and his employees still leave at a high rate.

Personality. The third, and perhaps most important, source of poor leadership behavior involves the personality of the leader. Hogan () believed that many unsuccessful leaders are insecure and adopt one of three personality types: the paranoid or passive-aggressive, the high-likability floater, and the narcissist.

The source of insecurity for leaders who are paranoid, passive-aggressive, or both is some incident in their life in which they felt betrayed. This paranoid/ passive-aggressive leader has deeply rooted, but perhaps unconscious, resentment and anger. On the surface, these leaders are charming, quiet people who often compliment their subordinates and fellow workers. But they resent the successes of others and are likely to act against subordinates in a passive-aggressive manner; that is, on the surface they appear to be supportive, but at the same time they will “stab” another person in the back.

The type of leader who is insecure and seldom rocks the boat or causes trou- ble is known as a high-likability floater. This person goes along with the group, is friendly to everyone, and never challenges anyone’s ideas. Thus, he travels through life with many friends and no enemies. The reason he has no enemies is because he never does anything, challenges anyone, or stands up for the rights of his employees. Such leaders will be promoted and never fired because even though they make no great performance advances, they are well liked. Their employees have high morale but show relatively low performance.

Narcissists are leaders who overcome their insecurity by overconfidence. They like to be the center of attention, promote their own accomplishments, and take most, if not all, of the credit for the successes of their group—but they avoid all blame for failure.

Rather than concentrate on traits as did Hogan, Shen and her colleagues () collected critical incidents of ineffective leader behavior and found that such behavior fell under ten basic dimensions:

Engaging in illegal and unethical behavior Avoiding conflict and people problems Demonstrating poor emotional control (e.g., yelling and screaming) Over-controlling (e.g., micromanaging)
