# The Department makes available a Prototype Eligibility and Rights and Responsibilities

Notice(https://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/WH-381.pdf) (Form WH-381), which employers may adapt as appropriate for

their use to meet their eligibility and rights and responsibilities notice requirements.

Designation notice. The employer is responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as FMLA-qualifying and giving notice of the designation to the employee. When the employer has enough information to determine

whether the leave is being taken for an FMLA-qualifying reason, such as after receiving a certiﬁcation, the

employer must notify the employee whether the leave is designated and will count as FMLA leave within ﬁve

business days, absent extenuating circumstances. Only one designation notice for each FMLA-qualifying

reason per applicable 12-month leave year is required. The employer must also notify the employee if it determines that the leave is not FMLA-qualifying and will not be designated as FMLA leave.

If the employer is requiring the employee to submit a ﬁtness-for-duty certiﬁcation to be restored to his or her

job, the employer must provide notice of the requirement with the designation notice. If the employer will

require that the ﬁtness-for-duty certiﬁcation address the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of

the employee's position, the employer must indicate so in the designation notice and include a list of the essential functions. If the employer handbook or other written documents describing the employer's leave

policies clearly provide that a ﬁtness-for-duty certiﬁcation will be required in speciﬁc circumstances, the

employer is not required to provide written notice of this requirement, but must provide at least oral notice no

later than at the time oﬀ the designation notice.

The designation notice must be in writing. The Department of Labor makes available a prototype Designation Notice(https://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/WH-382.pdf) (Form WH-382) for employer's use. If the leave is not

designated as FMLA leave because it does not meet the requirements for FMLA protection, the notice that the

leave is not designated FMLA may be in the form of a simple written statement. If the information provided by

the employer to the employee in the designation notice changes, the employer must provide written notice of

the change within ﬁve business days of receipt of the employee's ﬁrst notice of need for leave subsequent to the change.

Additionally, the employer must notify the employee of the amount of leave counted against his or her FMLA

entitlement. If known at the time the leave is designated, the employer must notify the employee of the number

of hours, days, or weeks that will be counted against the employee's FMLA entitlement. If it is not possible to provide the hours, days, or weeks that will be counted against the entitlement (such as in the case of

unforeseeable, intermittent leave), then the employer must provide notice of the amount of leave counted
