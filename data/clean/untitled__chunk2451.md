# Conclusion 443

The differences in approaches between the prevention sci- entist and the action researcher reﬂect the differences in val- ues of the contrasting paradigms. The tensions germinating from these two paradigms are so disparate that they may not be reconciled in the immediate future. Instead, these two alternative points of view about understanding the efﬁcacy of prevention programs are likely to continue to develop side by side. Interestingly, these contrasting approaches to preven- tion have parallels to research with cultural groups. Ana Marie Cauce and colleagues have framed these differences as the cultural equivalence approach and the cultural variance approach. The ﬁrst approach assumes that all people are essentially similar except for differences in life circum- stances. The second approach holds that the unique back- ground and experiences of each subminority group produces fundamental differences in risk and protective factors (Cauce, Coronado, & Watson, 1998; Roosa & Gonzales, 2000). The challenge for the future is whether the second approach will achieve increased attention as a viable and al- ternative view of prevention.
