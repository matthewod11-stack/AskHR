## Center the experience of autistic people.

For a long time, others have claimed to speak and decide for

autistic people, and much of the public discourse centered on non-

autistic autism professionals or family members. But the neurodiversity

movement encouraged many autistic people to advocate for themselves

and adopt “nothing about us without us” as a motto. Here are ways

leaders and allies can help others see from the autistic perspective:

- Include your autistic employees in planning any relevant events — and

let them lead.

- Hire an autistic designer for your campaign materials.

- Before you ﬁnd an outside speaker, invite your employees to volunteer.

- Oﬀer virtual sensory sensitivities experiences that simulate sensory

overload in everyday situations (e.g., by amplifying common sounds

to simulate auditory sensitivity, or amplifying lights and vibrations)

to help allistic (non-autistic) employees understand the role of

the environment in “disabling” individuals and develop empathy

toward neurodivergent colleagues. This should be accompanied by an

explanation that everyone’s autism experience is diﬀerent.
