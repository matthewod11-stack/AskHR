## Decision : Should Dimensions Be Weighted?

Once the type of dimension has been determined, the next decision is whether the dimensions should be weighted so that some are more important than others. Grading systems in the classes you have taken provide good examples of weight- ing dimensions. For example, you may have had a class where the final exam was given more weight than other exams or a class in which a particular project carried more weight than others.

Weighting dimensions makes good philosophical sense, as some dimensions might be more important to an organization than others. For example, the dimension of patient care would be more important for a nurse than would be keeping a pro- fessional appearance. Though both are important parts of the job, providing poor patient care has more of an impact for the organization than not wearing the proper clothing. Another advantage to differentially weighting dimensions is that it may reduce racial and other biases (McFarland, Wolf, & Nguyen, ).

Though differential weighting of dimensions makes sense and has some advantages, many organizations choose to weight all performance dimensions equally because it is administratively easier to compute and to explain to employees.
