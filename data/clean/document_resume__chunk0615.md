# Performance Appraisal

a case for evaluating the performance of tenured faculty in order to foster and maintain excellen' performance:I It is noteworthy that virtually no literature on performance appraisal posits a view that does not include the evaluative nature of performance appraisal.

Given that evaluation either takes place or that existing evaluation data are pre- sented in appraisal interviews, what can be done to reduce its negative impact? Three basic communication techniques that have potential to reduce the negative effects of employee evaluation in the performance interview arc offered. feedback clanfication, non evaluative listening, and achieving an appropriate balance of praise and cnticism. It should be noted again that the interviewer/supervisor must assume responsibility to use such techniques, although employees can also be taught these skills.

Non-evaluative listening involves receicing communication from an appraisee without placing any value judgment on the message or the sender, that is, concentrating on tasks, roles, and results rather than the personality of the interviewee.42 Ironically, by temporarily suspending intentions in performance counseling interviews, one may more likely achieve goals because interviewee resistance is decreased by curtailing judgments.41 Feedback clarification refers to the ability to paraphrase content back to the speaker and to reflect the feelings of the speaker.41 When an appraiser provides accurate feedback; the appraisee adds to his/her self-understanding; resulting in improved self-esteem and personal effectiveness. It i not sufficient to simply repeat back, or mimic, the words of the appraisee; it is necessary to feed back accurate under- standings of both content and feelings expressed.

Much has been written about the so-called "sandwich" technique where negative evaluations are sandwiched between praises. StanÂ° believed that skill in balancing praise and criticit.m in performance interviews can help circumvent the debilitating effects of evaluation, however, he believes that the "sandwich" technique is too obvi- ous. He recommends dispensing supportive feedback almost exclusively at the begin- ning of the interview, thus, establishing an initial positive climate and creating appraisee receptiveness to more thorough analysis in aieas where improvement is needed.45

Use of feedback clarification, non evaluative listening, and balancing praise and criticism in performance interviews nuninuie the negato, e aspects of communicating evaluative messages in one other significant way. by reducing the likelihood of open hostility. Skopec's research findings support that uncertainty in dealing with con- frontations and other hostile interiewee reactions and the need to maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships following appraisal Intel s constitute primary concerns of performance appraisers When appraisees arc heard accurately and understood, they are less likely to be hostile and confrontive.46

Laird and Ciampitt claimed that the performance appraisal process may be sabo- taged by multiple use of appraisal documents.
