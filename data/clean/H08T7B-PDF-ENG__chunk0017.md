Team Omega, meanwhile, seemed caught in a perpetual storm.

Individual meetings toggled between high-energy brainstorming and

detailed task planning. Members attempting to reﬁne strategies

sometimes found their thoughts drowned out by teammates excitedly

pitching new ideas. At the same time, others brought in fresh insights

from the industry, further complicating the discussion. Meetings

started to feel chaotic, leading to frustration and confusion. Without

clear distinctions between learning activities, Omega team members

frequently experienced cognitive overload that sapped energy and

morale. Progress stalled, deadlines slipped, and promising ideas never

fully materialized.
