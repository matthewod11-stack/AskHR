transferring its information to the central nervous system for processing, and thus remains closely allied with the physical and biological sciences. Perceptual research is often focused on correspondence and noncorrespondence issues, where there are unexpected discrepancies between external and in- ternal realities that require attention and veriﬁcation, or where we are looking at instances where the conscious percept is ei- ther too limited or too good in the context of the available sen- soryinputs.Itismorecloselyalliedtocognitive,learning,and information-processing issues. Thus, while sensory research becomes the search for the speciﬁc physical or physiological process that can “explain” the perceptual data, perceptual researchthenbecomesthemeansofexplaininghowwegobe- yond the sensory data to construct our view of reality.The im- portance of nonsensory contributions to the ﬁnal conscious representationstill remains anissuein perceptualresearch but is invisible in sensory research. The history of sensation and perception thus has seen a gradual separation between these twoareas.Today,sensoryresearcherstendtoviewthemselves more as neuroscientists, while perceptual researchers tend to view themselves more as cognitive scientists.

While the distinction between sensation and perception is necessary and useful, the task of the future may be to ﬁnd some way of reuniting these two aspects of research. Cer- tainly they are united in the organism and are interdependent aspects of behavior. I am reminded of a line by Judith Guest in her book Ordinary People, where she asked the question that we must ask about sensation and perception: “Two sepa- rate, distinct personalities, not separate at all, but inextricably bound, soul and body and mind, to each other, how did we get so far apart so fast?”
