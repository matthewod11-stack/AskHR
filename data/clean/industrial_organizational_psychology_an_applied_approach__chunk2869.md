At Avon, we currently view

leadership as a competency with four components. The first component is the extent to which leaders understand and successfully manage them- selves and their relationships with others. Effective leaders strive for self-awareness and self-regulation. For individuals to successfully demonstrate this competency, they would establish and build productive working relationships with oth- ers, take accountability for their own performance and growth, and relate to people in an open, friendly, and accepting man- ner. They express themselves to individuals and groups in a manner that enhances under- standing and understand the existing and potential custom- ers and markets.

The second leadership component is that leaders must have a relentless account- ability for results while at the same time being governed by business ethics and embracing change. Leaders must have the courage to make tough calls, to create an environment that continuously raises the

bar, and to act decisively using facts and discipline. Effective leaders at Avon drive results and obtain success in spite of obstacles. They make timely and sound decisions and man- age resources effectively. They have the ability to influence and interest others in career opportunities, products, pro- grams, and initiatives. To make the best decisions, our leaders are taught to identify and analyze data and options prior to making decisions. To be suc- cessful, leaders must develop action plans and schedules to accomplish their goals and objectives.

A third component of leadership competency is the ability to nurture talent. This means putting the right people in the right jobs at the right time. Effective leaders at Avon focus on developing the next generation of leaders by promoting those who deliver results, develop talent, and differentiate performance. Our leaders identify the needs of individuals and provide rel- evant training and coaching to help them succeed. They

identify and engage others to participate in beneficial career opportunities. By earning respect and gaining commitment and coopera- tion, they inspire others to take action.

The final piece to the leadership puzzle is the ability to break down barriers and to manage matrix relation- ships. Effective leaders must be strategic thinkers and action-oriented implementers who integrate a diversity of perspectives. They can work across geographical boundaries and work closely with relevant business partners. They have the ability to understand, appreciate, and build on the contributions of those from varied backgrounds and points of view.

Although individu- als must possess many core competencies to be effective leaders at Avon, I think leadership is a core competency an organization must develop. Without true leaders, organizations don’t innovate. Instead, they copy and are not original.
