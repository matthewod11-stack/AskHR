of continuous performance appraisal, not as Martin and Bartol (1998) state ‘a periodic ritual that proves unpleasant for employees and supervisors’. Organisations may choose to accept the dominant culture or alternatively change it through performance management. In the 1980s a number of organisations moved towards a more reward based performance assessment to shift the culture to one with more of a performance orientation. Generating a more performance oriented culture was a key feature of the interest in early individual performance-related pay schemes (Kessler, 2000). Other organisations aim for a greater customer focus and signal their approbation of customer-friendly behaviours through competence or contribution-based pay (Brown and Armstrong, 1999).

De Waal (2003) found that an organisational culture focused on using the performance management process to improve the business is a key behavioural factor in the effective implementation of PM processes. De Waal found that open communication and trust in performance information is critical. Research by Martinez (2005) also found through a case study of a European Electricity Supplier that a benefit of implementing a performance management system was the change in employees behaviour; it encouraged a ‘tolerance to failure’, improved transparency of information and improved vertical and horizontal cooperation. As a result, the culture at the company was perceived to ’move from a reactive and command-and-control culture to an open and proactive one’. Holloway et al. (1995, cited in De Waal, 2005) provide a useful summary statement that ‘the successful implementation of a performance management system depends on understanding and accommodating the behavioural factors of performance management’ (p.61).

Alongside the need to integrate performance management into the culture of the organisation is the recognition that systems should be adapted to accommodate the different requirements of the varied employees within an organisation (Rees and Porter, 2003). Rees and Porter suggest that systems should take into account differing organisational needs and priorities, levels of managerial expertise, styles of management and the sophistication of employees. Cederblom (1982) equally proposes that different employees in different circumstances need essentially different appraisal dialogues, which he describes as the ‘contingency model’. In this model he distinguishes between:
