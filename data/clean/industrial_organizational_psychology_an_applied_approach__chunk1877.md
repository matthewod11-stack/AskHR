Open-ended questions to elicit audience response and encourage discussion. Free writes in which audience members are asked to write about the topic. For example, in a training seminar on sexual harassment, trainees were asked to write about a time when they either were harassed or saw another employee being harassed. In a training seminar on dealing with difficult customers, trainees were asked to write about an angry customer they had to deal with and how they handled the situation.

There are three considerations in choosing an icebreaker: the goal of the ice-

breaker, the length of the training session, and the nature of the audience.

Goal. For an icebreaker to be successful, it must accomplish a goal. The most com- mon goals for icebreakers are to get people to know one another, to get them talking, to wake them up, and to get them thinking about the topic. For example, introductions work well when it is important that the audience members know one another, and free writes work well when the goal is to get the audience think- ing about a topic. Having an icebreaker for the sake of having an icebreaker is not a good idea.

Length of the Training Session. If the training session will last only a few hours, the ice- breaker should be short—if one is even used. If the training session will last an entire week, time should be spent on introductions and “group bonding” activities.

Nature of the Audience. Certain types of icebreakers work better with some audi- ences than they do with others. For example, having a group of trainees introduce themselves by saying their name and a trait starting with the first letter of their name (e.g., Friendly Fred, Timid Temea, Zany Zach) is not likely to go over as well with a group of police officers as it might with a group of social workers.

Making the Presentation Though this is not a public speaking text, here are some tips you might find use- ful in making a training presentation:

Make eye contact with the audience. Use gestures effectively. That is, don’t wave your hands or use other gestures unless they help make a point. Don’t read your presentation. Use visuals such as your PowerPoint slides to guide you. If you know your material and have practiced your presentation, all you should need is the occasional reminder that can be provided by glancing at your PowerPoint slides projected on the screen. Don’t hide behind the podium. Use a conversational style. A training presentation is not a speech, lecture, or sermon. Talk with your audience, not at them. Be confident. Avoid the use of fillers, speak at an appropriate volume, and don’t brag about yourself. If you know your stuff, the audience will notice—you don’t have to tell them how smart you are. Speak at a pace that is neither too fast nor too slow. Avoid swearing, making off-color or offensive remarks, and demeaning other people, groups, or organizations. Try to make the presentation interesting. This can be done by using fun (e.g., humor, stories) or a variety of activities (e.g., lecture, video, discussion, activity), creating energy either through the speaker’s pace or
