# UNDERSTANDING TOOLS AND AGENTS

As organizations progress in their AI journey, two key concepts become increasingly important: tools and agents. These capabilities represent the frontier of enterprise AI implementation, enabling systems that can not only understand requests but take action to fulfill them.

Tools Tool use (sometimes called function calling) represents a fun- damental leap in AI capability. Rather than simply responding with text, AI models can interact with external systems and functions to accomplish specific tasks. Tools are defined func- tions that the AI can call to perform specific actions, enabling AI to access real-time data, allowing direct integration across systems, and supporting complex business processes.

Agents An LLM Agent is a system that combines a large language model with the ability to take actions in the real world or digital environments. Key components typically include:

- 1. The base LLM for reasoning and planning 2. Tools/functions the agent can use (like web searches, APIs, or computer access)

- 3. A decision-making framework to choose appropriate
