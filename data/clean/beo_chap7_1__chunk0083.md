## their left calves as a sign of camaraderie.

Group loyalty can persist even when workers leave the firm. For example, it is

typical for lawyers and consultants to eventually leave their firms and work for

one of the firms’ clients (whom they worked with originally). While there is a clear

difference in the employee’s decision rights after switching firms, there may be little

difference in emotional attachment to their old group (the law firm) and their new

group (the client firm). Many consulting firms keep active lists of “alumni” who

have left the firm to work for their clients, and presumably use the residue of group

loyalty to keep those clients and to resolve disputes.
