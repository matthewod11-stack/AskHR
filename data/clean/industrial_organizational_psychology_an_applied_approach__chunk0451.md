chapter 

In ,  English settlers established a colony on Roanoke Island near what is

now the Outer Banks of the North Carolina coast. When John White arrived at Roanoke Island in , he found no trace of the colony and only the word Croatan carved on a tree. To this day, it is not known what happened to the settlers of the Lost Colony of Roanoke.

Many theories have been put forth to explain the fate of the lost colony—killed by Indians, moved to another location, and so on. One theory is that the members of the colony were not prepared to survive in the new continent; that is, the group consisted of politicians, soldiers, and sailors. Although worthy individuals were sent to the New World, few had the necessary training and skills to survive. In fact, the colony might have survived if settlers with more appropriate skills, such as farmers, had been sent instead of the traditional explorer types. Th us, a better match between job requirements and personnel might have saved the colony.

Does this sound far-fetched? Perhaps so, but the story does underscore the importance of a process called job analysis—gathering, analyzing, and structur- ing information about a job’s components, characteristics, and requirements (Sanchez & Levine, ).
