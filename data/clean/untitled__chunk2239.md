## Emergence of Forensic Psychology as a Recognized Subﬁeld 403

the sometime girlfriend of a therapy client at the clinic who, during therapy, made serious threats toward her. The therapist told the campus police, who talked to the young man and concluded that he was not dangerous. Ms. Tarasoff was never told of the man’s threats; two months later he stabbed her to death. The court ruled that the therapist “bears a duty to exer- cise reasonable care to protect the foreseeable victim of that danger [of violence]” (Tarasoff, 1976, p. 345). Tarasoff and related court decisions place some limitations on the therapy client’s right to complete conﬁdentiality. The legal test for knowing whether to report a threat is whether the psycholo- gist knew or should have known (in a professional capacity) of the client’s dangerousness (Keith-Spiegel & Koocher, 1985). All psychologists have an afﬁrmative duty to report suspected cases of child sexual abuse and, in many jurisdic- tions, elder abuse as well. As a consequence, the necessity of being able to accurately assess risk for violence has as- sumed great importance to many forensic psychologists (Applebaum, 1985; Ogloff, 1999). For some, the fear of adverse legal complications or of malpractice litigation may have produced changes in practice, such as conducting “defensive psychotherapy” (Applebaum, 1988).
