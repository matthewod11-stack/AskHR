## personalization on companies’ growth and shareholder returns. We

developed, tested, and reﬁned the index’s rubric internally at BCG

and in our work with hundreds of clients. It uses objective questions,

which allows scoring to remain consistent, whether the assessment was

conducted by someone at BCG or by clients themselves.

Our research uncovered a set of performance drivers for each

component of the Personalization Index. Let’s look at each one in turn

and examine how personalization leaders—companies that score in the

top quartile of the index overall and excel in at least one area—are

getting it right.
