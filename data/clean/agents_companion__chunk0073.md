## orchestration, memory, and task decomposition.

Figure 2. Each of these “Ops” are about technology, processes, and people14

All of these “Ops” are, in essence, the harmonious blend of people, processes, and

technologies working together to efficiently deploy machine learning solutions into a

live production environment. It’s crucial to recognize that Ops extends beyond mere

technology; it’s not simply about constructing and delivering a ML pipeline. Successful Ops

implementations delve deeper, considering the customer’s operational model, their existing

business units, and their overall organizational structure. This holistic approach ensures that

the technology is tailored to their specific needs, seamlessly integrating into the business

and maximizing value.

The next section will cover Agent Evaluation in detail, which is a significant part of the story

for AgentOps and automation to capture useful metrics. Before we go there, let’s start with a

thought experiment; imagine setting up an A/B experiment in production for your new Agent.

The treatment arm gets your new agent and the control arm does not. In that scenario, what

metrics are you measuring to determine if the treatment arm is doing better? What metrics

are you measuring to determine ROI for the project? Is it a goal being accomplished, or

sales totals, or a set of critical steps in a user journey? Those metrics must be understood,

instrumented and easily analyzed in addition to more detailed Agent Evaluation metrics.
