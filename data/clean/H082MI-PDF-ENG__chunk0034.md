## question with a typical, ﬂat response like “Good, and you?” use the

opportunity to highlight your work and life. You could say something

like: “I’m well, thanks. Just ﬁnished wrapping up [a project or task],” or

“I’m excited to be working on [a project or task you’re proud of], and

this evening I’m dabbling in my love for [what you’re doing for fun, as a

hobby, or for self-care and why you enjoy it]. How’s life for you?”

Work and life can easily intertwine — this style of communication

allows you to address both. It’s important for your employees to realize

you’re well-rounded and have a life outside work, too.
