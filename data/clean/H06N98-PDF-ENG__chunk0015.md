## very diverse external participants in the ﬁrst stages of strategy-making.

Partly because this oﬀers new thinking but even more importantly as

it legitimizes a new idea, thereby helping executives to unite around a

particular direction. Happily, participants during idea generation don’t

need very much company-speciﬁc information to get the ideas ﬂowing,

making secrecy easiest to maintain during this phase.

The U.S. Navy for example set up a multiplayer online game to develop

ideas for a new aviation strategy. Six hundred participants — including

industry partners, academics, and others not part of the Navy — posted

and voted on over 5,000 ideas.

The Navy relied on four crucial elements to exert considerable control.

First, they previously experimented with openness in a limited, low-risk

way, e.g., in a game asking how to respond to the Somali piracy issue.

This helped them to understand how open strategy worked and to build

a robust, leak-proof system. Second, they could rely on a culture of

conﬁdentiality — which every organization must build in the age of

social media — to enforce secrecy. Third, they sought legal counsel to

ensure that no issues will emerge on this front. And fourth, they were

aware that in order to generate new ideas it was not necessary to share

what they had already done and what they are planning to do in future.

After the exercise they distributed a report that identiﬁed 127 ideas.

This satisﬁed the curiosity of participants without telling what the Navy

would actually do next.
