# Message Composition Agent

The Message Composition Agent is specialized in helping users draft, summarize, and send

messages or emails while driving. This agent parses voice commands like "Tell Alex I'm

running late," uses natural language models to compose contextually appropriate messages,

offers draft previews with user modification options, and integrates with various messaging

apps including SMS, WhatsApp, and email.
