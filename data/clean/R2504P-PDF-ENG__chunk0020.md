## HBR / Magazine Article / Case Study: Do We Reskill or Replace Our Workforce?

Jon’s manufacturing, installation, and maintenance peers all nodded

vigorously and murmured agreements. He continued, “The service

technician arriving at a customer’s premises is a visible display of the

value we bring. We lose our frontline relationship with the customer

if we are just squirting software updates to them in the middle of the

night. There will be no loyalty.”

Alex felt a knot forming in his stomach. He’d had similar concerns but

pushed them aside. He was thankful when Maya Perrineau, his chief

sales oﬃcer, chimed in. “But that’s everyone’s knee-jerk reaction to the

idea of upskilling, right? ‘Is our industry really changing that quickly?

Does everyone have to do it? Can’t we just expand our digital team to handle that stuﬀ?’ But I can tell you that what customers want now

are the same great elevators we’ve always made upgraded with all the

modern conveniences—not layered on but integrated.”

Tony Wu, SolidTech’s chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer, spoke up next. “This

reminds me of ‘ghost oﬃces’ in Japan. These are the workplaces where companies that are committed to oﬀering lifetime employment send

their workers when their skills become obsolete. They’re still employed,

but they have no purpose. They’re ghosts.” He paused. “It goes without saying that we can’t aﬀord to do that. But also I don’t think it’s what any

of us want. We’ve got to work together to keep everyone’s skills relevant

—and Alex’s plan seems like a good way to do that.”

“But it’s not your teams that will need to reskill,” Jon countered. “It’s our

engineers and installers and maintenance guys. And I’m not sure they’ll all be able or willing to do that. So are we talking about layoﬀs for those people who don’t? And would you oﬀer job guarantees to the ones who

do, no matter how they perform?” The room fell silent.
