## PROMOTING THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL LIVES: GORDON ALLPORTAND HENRY MURRAY

By 1930, studies of personality were ﬂourishing, but person- ality was still considered a topic of several areas of psychol- ogy (e.g., abnormal, educational, and social) rather than a separate area. Gordon Allport played a central role in system- atizing and deﬁning the subﬁeld of personality psychology and separating it from social psychology (Barenbaum, 2000; Nicholson, 1998, in press; Winter & Barenbaum, 1999), and Henry Murray was inﬂuential in expanding the boundaries of the study of personality to include experimental investiga- tions of psychoanalytic concepts (Triplet, 1983; Winter & Barenbaum, 1999). Both Allport (1937b) and Murray (1938) promoted the intensive study of individual lives, an approach to the study of personality that their colleagues in psychology had generally overlooked. In doing so, each man drew upon his training in disciplines outside the mainstream of American psychology. In this section, we examine their efforts and assess the status of case studies and life histories in personality psychology in the 1930s and 1940s.
