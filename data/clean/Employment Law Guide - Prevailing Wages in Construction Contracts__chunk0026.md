# Worker Rights

The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) provide laborers and mechanics on covered contracts the right to

receive at least the locally prevailing wages (including fringe beneﬁts), as determined by the Department of

Labor, for the type of work performed. The Wage and Hour Division and contracting agencies accept complaints of alleged DBRA violations.

It is prohibited to retaliate against workers or job applicants for engaging in protected activities such as

making a complaint or cooperating in a WHD investigation under the DBRA.

Every contractor performing work covered by the Davis-Bacon labor standards must post the WH-1321 "Worker Rights Under the Davis-Bacon Act" poster at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place

where it may be easily seen by workers. The applicable DBRA wage determination, including any conformed

classiﬁcations, must be similarly posted.

Under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA), contractors must maintain records for all laborers and

mechanics during the course of the work and preserve the required records for a period of three years after all

the work on the prime contract is completed. Required records must include the following information for each

covered worker:

Name, address, telephone number, email address, and social security number; Correct classiﬁcation(s) of work actually performed;

Hourly rates of wages paid, including rates of contributions or costs anticipated for bona ﬁde fringe beneﬁts
