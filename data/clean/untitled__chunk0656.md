# 110 Cognition and Learning

became the study of learning, inquiring into how people and animals—another effect of evolution—acquire adaptive be- liefs and behaviors.

I divide my history of cognition and learning into three eras. The ﬁrst is the Philosophical Era, from Classical Greece up to the impact of evolution. The second is the Early Scien- tiﬁc Era, from the impact of evolution through behaviorism. The third is the Modern Scientiﬁc Era, when the psychologi- cal study of learning and cognition resumed its alliance with philosophy in the new interdisciplinary endeavor of cognitive science.
