# The Near and Middle East

The Ô¨Årst psychological organization in the Arab world was established in Egypt in 1948. The Israeli Psychological Asso- ciation was formed a decade later (1958), with Tunisian psychologists following in 1962. In the last decade of the twentieth century, psychologists in Yemen (1990) and Jordan (1996) formed national societies. Other countries in the re- gion with national associations are Iran and Morocco.
