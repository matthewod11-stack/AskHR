that might be difﬁcult

Research on the link between humor and training could focus on any of the three mechanisms described throughout this paper. Starting with the motivational mechanisms, humor could be explored with respect to humor producers’ intentions to use humor. For example, trainers that use humor might be attempting to build cohesiveness, decrease status differences between themselves and trainees, their message by inducing positive affect in the audience, or increasing source credibility (Lyttle, 2001). Trainees that use humor might also be trying to build cohesiveness or rapport with the trainer or fellow trainees. However, trainees might also use humor as a form of communication about other issues. For example, Grugulis (2002) found that humor might be used to communicate criticism or challenge of the trainer by the trainee in a more masked or subtle way. A trainee might also use humor to mask direct criticism of the trainer’s knowledge or techniques, or criticism of the validity of training more generally. In addition, humor might be used as an indirect way of communicating information about the trainee himself or herself, such as whether the material is easy or difﬁcult to understand, or whether the message that is being delivered is accepted by the trainee.

Cognitive effects of humor might also be a topic for fresh research on humor and training. Speciﬁcally, given that the appreciation of humor is characterized by enhanced brain activity (e.g., Goel & Dolan, 2001; Watson et al., 2007), that such brain activity is associated with the individual’s ability to connect disparate pieces of information (Fry, 2002), and with creativity, it seems logical to hypothesize that individuals in a learning context such as training might beneﬁt from increased humor-induced neural activation and an enhanced ability to connect disparate pieces of knowledge or information.
