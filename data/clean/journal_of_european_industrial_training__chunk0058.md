## Potential raters in 36088 feedback processes

Journal of European Industrial Training 25/1 [2001] 5Â±32 # MCB University Press [ISSN 0309-0590]

According to Ilgen et al. (1979), three distinct sources of feedback can be used to evaluate an individual's performance. The first category includes those who have observed the recipient's behaviour and are therefore in a position to evaluate it. This category includes the boss, peers, subordinates, internal/external customers. The second source of feedback is the task environment. Feedback may be inherent in working on the task itself; for example, in tracking tasks, it is usually apparent when the individual is not on target. The third category are the individuals themselves who may be able to judge their own performance. This section of the monograph explores the issues that are central when employing rating sources other than the traditional supervisory approach. It is interesting to note that, even in the 1960s and early 1970s, a number of papers explored various aspects of ratings from a number of sources other than one's supervisor. Thus, while the concept of 3608 feedback per se did not gain currency until the late 1980s and 1990s, the concept of ratings from numerous sources had received attention in the literature for some time.

The fundamental concept underpinning multi-source appraisal or 3608 feedback is the involvement of a number of rating sources in the performance appraisal process. The first rating source that receives attention here is the subordinate group and the second is peer ratings. It is these two rating sources which have been more rigorously explored in the literature. The four most common rating sources are: 1 the supervisor; 2 peers; 3 subordinates; and 4 self.

Other less popular sources such as external customers, suppliers, etc., are not considered here.
