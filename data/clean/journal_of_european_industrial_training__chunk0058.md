# Upward feedback

One of the major innovations of the 3608 feedback process is that it affords subordinates an opportunity to provide feedback to superiors. Upward or subordinate appraisal/feedback occurs where subordinates rate the performance of their immediate supervisor on several performance dimensions and the results are formally fed back to the focal individual (Atwater et al., 2000). Graddick and Lane (1998) suggest that upward feedback is increasingly a component of executive appraisals.

Upward feedback is recognised as one

component of the wider 3608 feedback process (Waldman and Atwater, 1998) and is also perceived as an important process that contributes to individual and organisational development (Bernardin and Beatty, 1987; London et al., 1990). While there is growing interest in upward appraisal both in the academic literature and in practice, with companies such as IBM, RCA and Syntex using it in their performance appraisal systems, these companies represent the minority rather than the majority. Bernardin and Beatty (1987) highlight some possible reasons why upward appraisals are not widely adopted in organisations.

First, they suggest that the traditional top-

down supervisory appraisal is the most common approach and is more compatible with an autocratic style of management than upward appraisal would be. Second, relatively little has been written on the area of upward appraisal to persuade practitioners to change to this appraisal system. While there have been quite a number of publications focusing on upward/subordinate appraisal since Bernardin and Beatty's article in 1987, it still remains an under-studied area in the HRD literature.
