## Without replenishment, the risk of burnout and long-term health issues

climbs. Ironically, the more depleted you become, the less likely you are

to engage in the very behaviors that would help. This is known as the

recovery paradox: when you need a break the most, you’re least likely to

take one.

Critically, recovering isn’t just about taking time oﬀ. It’s about engaging

in the right kinds of experiences. Research highlights four that are particularly eﬀective:

- Detachment, or giving your mind a true break. Resist checking email

after hours and avoid replaying the workday in your head.

- Relaxation, or building in moments like taking a walk without your

phone, listening to a calming playlist, or spending quiet time outdoors.

- Mastery, or doing something that challenges you in a positive way.
