## HBR / Digital Article / Does Your Hybrid Strategy Need to Change?

remote — but some of this work can be greatly enhanced with the use

of generative AI. A ﬁeld experiment that our BCG colleagues conducted

with the support of a group of academics from HBS, MIT, Wharton,

and the University of Warwick found that for tasks that involve creative

ideation, GenAI generates output that should be considered as a ﬁnal

draft (versus a ﬁrst draft that humans need to take time to edit). This

means that for some employees, the mix of work that they do may start

to shift, as they hand over some of the focus work they would have

preferred to do remotely and pick up other tasks beyond the frontier

of generative AI’s competence. As a result, their work models may also

need to shift, depending on what these new tasks are.

Recognize the Needs of the People

In our survey, roughly 90% of employees who identify as female,

caregivers, LGBTQ+, or as having a disability consider ﬂexible work

options an important factor when deciding whether to stay in or leave

their job. That is 30% higher than employees who did not identify with

these categories. In other words: If you care about diversity, equity, and

inclusion, you need to get your working model right.

We saw a particularly wide gap when it comes to gender: Female

employees are 1.5 times more likely than their male counterparts to

prioritize ﬂexibility. And this is not just a working-mom phenomenon. We found only a marginal diﬀerence (3%) among women when

comparing caregivers with non-caregivers.

Our biological cognitive diﬀerences also indicate preferences toward

certain work environments. In some situations, groups of people doing

the same job may have similar cognitive proﬁles. For example, a team of

software engineers is more likely to be “analytical/tough-minded” and

therefore might work best when allowed to maintain focus and prefer to

have routines in how they do their day-to-day work.
