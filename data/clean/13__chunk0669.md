# INTRODUCTION

Reputation has been shown to be an important factor in assessing the worth of an organization (Gotsi & Wilson, 2001), or the value of a product (Feldwick, 1996), and it has been positioned as playing important roles in managerial behavior (Ferris, Fedor, & King, 1994) and leadership (Ammeter, Douglas, Gardner, Hochwarter, & Ferris, 2002; Blass & Ferris, 2007; Hall, Blass, Ferris, & Massengale, 2004). Nevertheless, very little theory and research on personal reputation has been reported, and the nature and dynamics of how a reputation is developed, and its impact on social interactions, has received limited attention in the organizational sciences literature (e.g., Ferris, Blass, Douglas, Kolodinsky, & Treadway, 2003).

There has been considerable research interest in recent years in corporate reputation (e.g., Rindova, Williamson, Petkova, & Sever, 2005; Fombrun, 1996), and new interest in subunit or department reputation (Ferris et al., in press-a). Unfortunately, after what appeared to be the beginning of a serious stream of research on personal reputation two decades ago (i.e., Gioia & Sims, 1983; Tedeschi & Melburg, 1984; Tsui, 1984), and a limited revival of interest in the mid-1990s (Bromley, 1993; Tsui, 1994), little work subsequently has been published in the organizational sciences literature in this area.

The purpose of the present paper is to address this need in the ﬁeld by articulating the conceptual foundations and dynamics of this construct, and thereby move closer toward the formulation of a theory of personal reputation in organizations. We begin by establishing the construct domain and deﬁnition of personal reputation, followed by a review of the existing research on personal reputation in the organizational sciences. Then, we propose a model of personal reputation in organizations, including both antecedents and consequences, which incorporates multiple theoretical perspectives to address both the development (i.e., social comparison and self-regulation theories) and the transmission (i.e., signaling, social informa- tion processing and contagion, and communication theories) of reputation.
