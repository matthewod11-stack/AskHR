Self-Regulation Theory Self-regulation or self-control can be thought of as the effort people put forth in order to alter their own responses, which can include both attitudes and behaviors (e.g., Baumeister, Heatherton, & Tice, 1994). It entails starting, stopping, changing a process, or substituting one response or outcome for another in efforts to meet or achieve some standard. Much of the work on self-regulation originally stemmed from systems or control theory (Carver & Scheier, 1982).
