# Tight versus Loose Cultures

Culture speciﬁes what behaviors are desirable for members of the culture. Cultures differ not only in the number of imposed behavioral norms, but also in whether deviations from norms are to be punished severely. In tight cultures (e.g., Japan), where many behavioral norms exist, deviant behavior is not easily tolerated. Loose cultures (e.g., the U.S.), on the other hand, either have unclear norms or can tolerate deviance from norms (Pelto, 1968). Importantly, even tight societies include speciﬁc contexts that are loose (e.g., drinks after work in Japan). Because humor often disturbs the status quo (Davis, 1993), and can broach taboo subjects, the tightness/ looseness distinction can be important for understanding differences in the use and function of humor across cultures.
