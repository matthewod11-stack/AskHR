# Measures

We selected four outcome variables and modelled them as latent constructs. Unlike variables that can be observed directly (e.g. age, gender, eye colour) latent constructs are abstract concepts (e.g. happiness, and loyalty). To quantify these, researchers develop scales comprising multiple observable variables (items) (Bell et al., 2019). This section identifies the scales, and a sample of items used to capture and quantify the four outcome variables.

Except where otherwise noted, all items were coded 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. As an indicator of internal reliability, we report construct relia- bility (CR). Traditionally, Cronbach’s alpha (α) has been used, but it assumes equal factor loadings across indicators (tau-equivalence). Given factor loadings typically vary in structural equation models, construct reliability (CR) is preferred
