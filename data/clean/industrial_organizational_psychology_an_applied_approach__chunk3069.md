# Individual Versus Group Performance

When several people individually work on a problem but do not interact, they are called a nominal group. When several individuals interact to solve a problem, they are called an interacting group. An important decision a leader must make is when to assign tasks to individuals, nominal groups, or interacting groups. After decades of research investigating group effectiveness, the consensus appears to be that interacting groups will usually outperform one individual, but interacting groups do not outperform nominal groups (Kerr & Tinsdale, ).

Trust is important in jobs that involve working in groups

The importance of the difference between nominal and interacting groups can be found in an interesting study by Liden et al. (). Liden and his col- leagues had managers, nominal groups of employees, and interacting groups of employees read scenarios about a group member’s poor performance and then determine how the employee should be disciplined. The interacting groups and the managers decided on more severe levels of discipline than did the nominal groups.

If the task involves creating ideas, individuals should be asked to indepen- dently create them and then meet as a group. Although brainstorming is a commonly used technique, it is not an effective one. In brainstorming, group members are encouraged to say aloud any and all ideas that come to mind and are not allowed to comment on the ideas until all have been given. When research compares a brainstorming group’s creativity with that of a single individual, the brainstorming group will almost always be more creative. However, when comparing the number and quality of ideas created by nominal groups with the quality and number of ideas created by an interacting group in a brainstorming session, the ideas of nominal groups are more creative and of higher quality than ideas of the interacting group (Kerr & Tinsdale, ). This difference may par- tially be due to interacting groups setting lower goals than individuals (Larey & Paulus, ).

Due to the increasing cost of travel, it is increasingly common for groups to “meet” electronically (e.g., teleconference) rather than face-to-face. In fact, in my own consulting, it has become rare to fly to a company to participate in a meet- ing; almost everything is handled through email and teleconferences. The results of a meta-analysis by DeRosa, Smith, and Hantula () suggest that such a practice is not only cost effective, but results in more effective performance than face-to-face group meetings. DeRosa et al. found that electronic brainstorming groups outperform face-to-face interacting groups. The comparison with nomi- nal groups is more complicated. Overall, electronic brainstorming groups and
