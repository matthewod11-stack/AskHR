In early 2018 the group began a study

to determine whether their fears were founded. They created two surveys— one for men and one for women—and distributed them to workers in a wide range of industries, collecting data from 152 men and 303 women in all.

First the researchers sought to understand whether men and women held different views about what con- stitutes sexual harassment. They took this tack because men accused of the behavior frequently claim they didn’t understand how their actions were being perceived, while women who report it are sometimes deemed overly sensitive. The surveys described 19 behaviors—for instance, continuing to ask a female sub- ordinate out after she has said no, email- ing sexual jokes to a female subordinate, and commenting on a female subordi- nate’s looks—and asked people whether they amounted to harassment. For the most part, the two genders agreed. For the three items on which they differed, men were more likely than women to label the actions harassment. “Most men

know what sexual harassment is, and most women know what it is,” Atwater says. “The idea that men don’t know their behavior is bad and that women are making a mountain out of a molehill is largely untrue. If anything, women are more lenient in defining harassment.” Next the researchers explored the incidence of harassment in the work- place. Sixty-three percent of women reported having been harassed, with 33% experiencing it more than once. A woman’s age, the supervisor’s gender, whether the woman filled a blue-collar or a white-collar role, and whether she was married had no bearing on the like- lihood that she had been harassed. Just 20% of women who had been harassed reported the episode; among those who didn’t, the chief deterrents were fear of negative consequences and apprehen- sion that they would be labeled trouble- makers. Five percent of men admitted to having harassed a colleague, and another 20% said that “maybe” they had done so. The study’s biggest surprise has to do
