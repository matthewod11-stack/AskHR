# Appraisal by Outsiders

Appraisal by outsiders is based on the need for someone with speLialized expertise but without a vested interest in the appraisal results.

For faculty members the list might include publications, reading lists, community service projects, student clubs, aLtivity reports, test gains, student performance in subsequent courses or other institutions, and the like. For administrators there are accreditation studies, contraLts and grants, budgetary' Increases, management audits, and similar measures. Analogous examples could be cited for support personnel.

Organizational practiLe and empiriLid evidence suggest that the appraisal process should normally be conducted by the immediate superior who an integrate both judg- mental and quantitative measures.
