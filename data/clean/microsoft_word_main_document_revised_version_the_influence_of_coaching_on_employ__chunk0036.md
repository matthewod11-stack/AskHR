# 6.3 Limits of the study

One of the limitations of our study is the use of purposive samples. The rationale for this rests in two facts. The first is that we needed respondents who were actually receiving coaching from their supervisors to evaluate its impact on performance. We couldn’t guarantee that in a general population of salespeople most of them were receiving coaching, so in order to reach a useful sample to test our hypothesis we decided to use purposive samples. The second fact is that the concept of coaching is becoming very popular and people decide to use it to describe many interactions that could not be categorized as coaching. This was already stated elsewhere (Pousa, 2012) and the fact remains that within a random sample of salespeople many would call the intervention coaching when it is something different, thus introducing error in the measures and its correlations. We believe that the reasons for choosing a purposive sample are compelling, but nevertheless they remain a limit of this research.

Another limitation is that we used a single respondent to provide information about dependent and independent variables. This is an issue that drew the attention of scholars because using a single source of information might introduce a bias and inflate or deflate the results of a study (Cote and Buckley, 1987; Podsakoff et al., 2003;

Schmidtt, 1994; Spector, 1987, 1994, 2006). Although the potential effects of common method bias have been analyzed by many scholars, there is no agreement that using a single respondent automatically introduces a bias (Schmidtt, 1994; Spector, 1987, 1994, 2006). In order to evaluate this possibility we assessed the potential effect of a common source bias using the Harman’s single factor test as described in Podsakoff et al. (2003). Even our results suggest that there is not a substantial amount of common method variance present in the measures, the use of a single respondent to provide information about dependent and independent variables remains another limit of the study.

Finally, although we ruled out the potential effect of some variables like tenure and experience, others, like training or informal coaching received from peers, were not considered. This limit might be addressed in future studies.
