Invite a student to enter the room. Have them face the cadre. Inform the

student that they can choose to end the exercise at any time, without

stigma. Tell them that leaders all experience failure, which is honored

here as an opportunity to develop strength and wisdom.

Present the student with a training scenario. To provide verisimilitude

and emotional grip, the scenario should be tailored on the spot by

cadre to the student’s speciﬁc experience and organizational role. For

example, cadre could tailor the scenario: “You have just lost [speciﬁc

member of your team] to [speciﬁc competitor].” Or: “You have just

discovered that [speciﬁc product] has been downloaded twice as many

times as projected, doubling revenue.”

Once the student has been presented with the scenario, invite them

to propose a plan. Then have the cadre challenge it. Cadre should

not challenge the plan by presenting hypothetical objections. Instead,

cadre should directly inform the student: Your plan has resulted in [this

negative outcome]. For example, if a student proposes using a budget

surplus to hire more salesforce, cadre could inform the student that the

new hires did not increase sales enough to cover the salary expenditure.

Cadre should be speciﬁc about the negative outcome. For example, if

the student says, “I would then eliminate the new sales positions,” cadre

could say, “That created a crisis of conﬁdence in the remaining sales

team, and your top two salespeople [X and Y] resigned.”

The purpose of the cadre’s challenges is to diagnose how the student

responds to pressurized open-ended situations. Eﬀective leadership is
