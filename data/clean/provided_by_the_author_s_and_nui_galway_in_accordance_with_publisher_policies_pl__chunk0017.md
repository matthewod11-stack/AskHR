## Despite a significant degree of academic and practitioner interest the topic of

talent management remains underdeveloped. A key limitation is the fact that talent

management lacks a consistent definition and clear conceptual boundaries. The specific

contribution of the current paper is in developing a clear and concise definition of

strategic talent management. We also develop a theoretical model of strategic talent

management. In so doing we draw insights from a number of discreet literature bases.

Thus, the paper should aid future research in the area of talent management through (1)

helping researchers to clarify the conceptual boundaries of talent management and (2)

providing a theoretical framework that could help researchers in framing their research

efforts in the area. Additionally, it aids managers in engaging with some of the issues

they face with regard to talent management.
