# Frequency of Test Use

The frequency information given about the use of the Stanford-Binet and Wechsler scales derives from extensive survey data. Attention to the frequency with which various tests are used has characterized assessment psychology at least as far back as surveys conducted in 1934 and 1946 (see Loutit & Browne, 1947). Sundberg (1961) expanded on these earlier surveys with a nationwide sampling of test usage across a variety of clinical agencies and institutions, and his methodology was later repeated on a larger scale (Brown & McGuire, 1976; Lubin, Larsen, & Matarazzo, 1984; Lubin, Wallis, & Paine, 1971; and Piotrowski & Keller, 1989).

Other informative surveys have queried individual psy- chologists rather than agencies concerning the frequency with which they use various tests, including large samples of clinical psychologists (Archer & Newsom, 2000; Camara, Nathan, & Puente, 2000; Watkins, Campbell, Nieberding, & Hallmark, 1995), neuropsychologists (Butler, Retzlaff, & Vanderploeg, 1991; Camara et al., 2000; Lees-Haley, Smith, Williams, & Dunn, 1995), school psychologists (Kamphaus,

Petoskey, & Rowe, 2000; Stinnett, Havey, & Oehler-Stinnett, 1994; Wilson & Reschly, 1996), and forensic psycholo- gists doing criminal evaluations (Borum & Grisso, 1995), personal injury evaluations (Boccaccini & Brodsky, 1999), and custody evaluations (Ackerman & Ackerman, 1997; LaFortune & Carpenter, 1998). Surveys have recently been undertaken outside of the United States as well, as illustrated in a report by Muñiz, Prieto, Almeida, and Bartram (1999) on test use in Spain, Portugal, and Latin American countries. Without always repeating these reference citations, subse- quent comments in this chapter about test use frequency are based on the ﬁndings they report.
