# Brief Methods

Alongwith developingfull-lengthmeasures, Kaufman stimu- lated contemporary efforts to construct brief tests of intelli- gence.Aquest for brief methods has long been common to all types of psychological assessment, and intelligence testing provided especially fertile ground for developing short forms ofexistingmeasuresandconstructingnewmeasuresthatwere

short to begin with.The structure ofWechsler’s scales offered examiners obvious possibilities for replacing the fullWAIS or WISC with a selection of subtests they believed would be suf- ﬁcient for their purposes. As reviewed by Campbell (1998) and Kaufman (1990), many such beliefs became formalized as short forms comprising from two to six subtests and achieving varying success in estimating Wechsler IQ. The most promising compromises between saving time and ob- taining sufﬁcient data have been (a) the utilization of seven- subtest short forms for the WAIS-R and the WAIS-III, which have shown correlations in the high .90s with Full Scale IQ and provide dependable estimates of Verbal and Performance IQ as well (Ryan & Ward, 1999; Ward, 1990); and (b) the se- lection of an eight-subtest short form of the WISC-III that yields dependable estimates of both the IQ and Index Scores calculated for this measure (Donders, 1997).

Kaufman inﬂuenced these developments by constructing a new measure, the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT), which includes tasks measuring verbal facility and nonverbal reasoning and provides a composite score that can be used to estimate intellectual functioning for persons age 4 to 90 (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1990). The K-BIT became sufﬁ- ciently popular among practitioners to stimulate construction of numerous other new measures consisting of a small num- ber of traditional kinds of subtests, the most visible of these being the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; Psychological Corporation, 1999) and the Wide-Range Intel- ligence Test (WRIT; Glutting, Adams, & Sheslow, 1999).
