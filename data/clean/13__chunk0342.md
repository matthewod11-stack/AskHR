## Changing Predictability of Job Performance

Explicitly stated in some research on dynamic performance, and implicit in others, is that the presence of dynamic criteria poses a signiﬁcant problem for the prediction of job performance over time (i.e., reviewed earlier as the formerly second deﬁnition of dynamic criteria). Indeed, this was a concern raised by a number of researchers examining dynamic criteria (e.g., Ghiselli, 1956; Hanges et al., 1990; Henry & Hulin, 1987; MacKinney, 1967; Prien, 1966; Rambo et al., 1983; Smith, 1976). Some argued that the existence of dynamic criteria does not necessarily mean a lack of predictability (Ackerman, 1988, 1989; Barrett, Caldwell, & Alexander, 1989, 1992; Hanges et al., 1990). This led to an extensive debate in the literature on the effect of time on the validity of job performance predictors.

In their examination of validities examined longitudinally, Barrett et al. (1985) found examples of both stable and instable validities. They concluded that, ‘‘factors such as temporal unreliability and restriction of range serve as viable explanations in the few instances where signiﬁcant change over time was found’’ (Barrett et al., 1985, p. 53). Overall, they argued that evidence of
