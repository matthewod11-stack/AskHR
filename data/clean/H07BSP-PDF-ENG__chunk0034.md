## HBR / Digital Article / Using Simulations to Upskill Employees

when preparing for a sales call or coaching session or during those

conversations. The simulations allow for just-in-time learning in

contexts and time frames connected to actual job tasks.

Finally, upskilling typically involves frequent updating of content to

changing circumstances. Sales training is an example. Training here

must be a process, not an event. At any point in time, sales reps

and managers are dealing with multiple accounts and a changing

array of people and buying criteria. And the learning must recognize diﬀerences across countries and categories. Compared to other training

initiatives, a virtual simulation can be more easily modiﬁed and in

formats conducive to the manager accessing and practicing skills when

that practice has the most impact.

Simulation opportunities are expanding. The so-called “metaverse” may

or may not deliver on its current hype, but the investments being

made by companies in virtual reality increase training and simulation

options. Meanwhile, outside a classroom, which is where most adults

earn a living, learning is itself a learned behavior. These examples,

grounded in sound theory and supported by increasingly accessible and

ﬂexible technologies, indicate how companies can take advantage of

these developments and address a major societal workforce issue while

getting more from their training investments.
