## Keywords: goal setting, motivation, theory building

The present authors independently discovered the importance of goal setting for signiÔ¨Åcantly improving the performance of individuals and teams. We subsequently formed a research part- nership in 1974 (Latham & Locke, 1975) that has continued to the present day (e.g., Latham & Locke, 2018). In this chapter we describe our individual discoveries, our joint research that led to the development of the goal setting theory in 1990, and new developments to the theory since that time period.
