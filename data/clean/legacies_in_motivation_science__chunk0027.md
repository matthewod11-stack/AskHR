# Locke

I entered graduate school in the Department of Psychology at Cornell University in 1960.

My ﬁrst course was Introduction to Industrial- Organizational (I-O) Psychology taught by Pa- tricia Cain Smith, who was among the earliest and most respected female industrial psycholo- gists. The textbook she assigned to the students in this course was Principles of Industrial Psy- chology that she had coauthored with Thomas A. Ryan (Ryan & Smith, 1954). A ﬁgure in a chapter in this book entitled Industrial Motiva- tion showed the results of an experiment con- ducted in England by C. A. Mace (1935). The ﬁgure (p. 397) showed that employees who were given a speciﬁc goal to attain each day on a computation task showed markedly greater im- provement than those who had been told to do their best. However, no statistical tests had been used to analyze the data. Nevertheless, this ap- peared to be a promising way to approach the topic of work motivation.1

To put this in context, I must digress with a discussion of the ﬁeld of psychology at that

excited by Locke’s ﬁndings.
