## Chapter 1 • Performance Management and Reward Systems in Context

the manager build a better relationship with that person. Also, supervisors gain a better understanding of each individual’s contribution to the organization. This can be useful for direct supervisors as well as for supervisors once removed.

- 4. The definitions of job and criteria are clarified. The job of the person being appraised may be clarified and defined more clearly. In other words, employees gain a better understanding of the behaviors and results required of their specific position. Employees also gain a better understanding of what it takes to be a successful performer (i.e., what are the specific criteria that define job success). 5. Self-insight and development are enhanced. The participants in the system are likely to develop a better understanding of themselves and of the kind of development activities that are of value to them as they progress through the organization. Participants in the system also gain a better understanding of their particular strengths and weaknesses that can help them better define future career paths.

- 6. Administrative actions are more fair and appropriate. Performance management systems provide valid information about performance that can be used for adminis- trative actions such as merit increases, promotions, and transfers as well as termina- tions. In general, a performance management system helps ensure that rewards are distributed on a fair and credible basis. In turn, such decisions based on a sound performance management system lead to improved interpersonal relationships and enhanced supervisor–subordinate trust.11 For example, a good performance man- agement system can help mitigate explicit or implicit emphasis on age as a basis for decisions. This is particularly important given the aging working population in the United States, Europe, and many other countries around the world.12

- 7. Organizational goals are made clear. The goals of the unit and the organization are made clear, and the employee understands the link between what she does and orga- nizational success. This is a contribution to the communication of what the unit and the organization are all about and how organizational goals cascade down to the unit and the individual employee. Performance management systems can help improve employee acceptance of these wider goals (i.e., organizational and unit levels).

- 8. Employees become more competent. An obvious contribution is that employee performance is improved. In addition, there is a solid foundation for helping employees become more successful by establishing developmental plans.

- 9. Employee misconduct is minimized.13 Employee misconduct is an increasingly pervasive phenomenon that has received widespread media coverage. Such misconduct includes accounting irregularities, churning customer accounts, abus- ing overtime policies, giving inappropriate gifts to clients and potential clients hoping to secure their business, and using company resources for personal use. Although some individuals are more likely to engage in misconduct compared to others based on individual differences in personality and other attributes, having a good performance management in place provides the appropriate context so that misconduct is clearly defined and labeled as such and identified early on before it leads to sometimes irreversible negative consequences.

- 10. There is better protection from lawsuits. Data collected through performance management systems can help document compliance with regulations (e.g., equal treatment of all employees regardless of sex or ethnic background). When performance management systems are not in place, arbitrary performance
