# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 245

place climate needs to be part of the initial organizational analysis during the needs assessment phase. In addition, climate has been found to affect motivational and training transfer outcomes (Bald- win & Ford, 1988; Colquitt et al., 2000).

Much less attention has been paid in the industrial/organiza- tional psychology literature to what situations are embedded in the pretraining and delivery of training and how they affect learning states, motivation to learn, self-regulatory strategies, and ultimately knowledge and skill acquisition. Based on this understanding, we can begin to develop interventions to create more effective learn- ing states.

Research in educational psychology is beginning to show that certain student learning contexts matter in terms of affecting mo- tivation to learn and learning activities. One focus of the research deals with classroom practices that positively affect intrinsic moti- vation (Brophy, 1998). For example, Guthrie, Wigﬁeld, and Von Secker (2000) designed an instructional environment for reading that included multiple pathways for affecting student intrinsic mo- tivation. They found that regardless of individual differences, an instructional context that emphasized learning goals, real-world interaction (hands-on activities), competence support (instruction on strategies to use), and autonomy support (self-directed learn- ing and collaboration) led to higher motivation and greater strat- egy use than a traditional classroom instruction that addressed the same content. Thus, the incorporation of effective learning and design principles can create learning states that are beneﬁcial for all learners (Noe & Colquitt, 2002).

Research also indicates that many trait variables that training research has shown are important to pretraining motivation also have state variable analogues. These learning states provide a point of leverage for trainers in developing pretraining motivation. Sev- eral examples of variables that have been treated as both traits and states include locus of control, anxiety, and goal orientation (Chen, Gully, Whiteman, & Kilcullen, 2000; Fisher, 1998; Rotter, 1966; Spielberger, 1966, 1977; Weiner, 1983, 1985). For example, Chen et al. found that statelike individual difference factors such as goal orientation and state anxiety mediated the relationships between traitlike individual differences and learning performance. The fact that these variables can be viewed as states implies that they can be
