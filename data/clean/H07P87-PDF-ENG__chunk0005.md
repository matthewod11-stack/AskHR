# the foundation for long-term success.

The starting point is to engage in what Dan Ciampa, the noted executive

coach, deﬁned as “era planning.” Your era is the anticipated duration of

time you think you will be in the new position. Of course, you may end

up staying longer or leaving earlier, but try to make a rough guess about

when you will have accomplished enough to be “done.” You’ll want to

ask yourself two key questions: “As I wrap up this job, what will be true?”

and “What will be possible?”
