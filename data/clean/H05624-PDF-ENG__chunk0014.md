# adjust.

Also: equal treatment for mothers and fathers. It can be longer for

women if there are health complications related to the pregnancy or

labor and delivery. But we’re deliberate about calling it “family leave”

because I and lots of dads believe we have an equal responsibility

in parenting. And this sets us up for more equality in the workplace

because there’s less worrying — which, unfortunately, you do see — that

female hires will get pregnant. If we just assume that any man or woman

we bring on might one day have a kid and take time oﬀ for that kid,

we’re in a nicer place.

I want to be clear, though, that none of this means prescribing speciﬁc

roles and responsibilities for any parent. It is more about the freedom

to decide. The biggest criticism I see is tweets from people who say,

“I don’t need more than a week oﬀ after having a kid.” That’s ﬁne. It’s

your choice. But the opportunity should be extended to every single

expecting parent.
