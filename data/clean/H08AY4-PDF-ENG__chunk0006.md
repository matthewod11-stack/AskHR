Giving performance feedback is a part of every people leader’s job.

And yet, in my work with these leaders and teams, I’ve found that they

often have negative mental models of what a feedback conversation is

supposed to look like. Those pre-conceived notions can act as a barrier

to giving timely, helpful, and honest performance feedback. Part of my

job as a coach and facilitator is to help challenge people’s mindsets

about what makes giving feedback so hard.
