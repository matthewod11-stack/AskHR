# inclusivity.

“We regularly have diversity training to educate our team on topics

such as the Tulsa massacre and Juneteenth,” Weaver says. “We’ve done

skills building to have everyone walk through their journey together

and identify their own implicit biases. Every time we do training, team

members share that one of their favorite parts of our culture is that we

create space for everyone to learn about these topics together.”
