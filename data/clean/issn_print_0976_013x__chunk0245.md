from managing individual management silos traditionally to the supply chain aspect emerged

as the more holistic and practical approach. And presently, supply chains, especially global

ones, are responsible for the worldwide availability of products and services. The supply

chain has always been challenging as it deals with several conflicts, interests, regulations, and

targets. Supply chain models are need-oriented and require tuning to improve performance

from whatever aspect is demanded or conceived as prime importance. Innovation, real-time

decision-making, sustainability orientation, and human-centric are the critical ingredients

identified to gain a competitive edge for supply chains in future (Turner, 2023). Supply

chains are continuously evolving to attain a competitive edge, and this study aims to cover

the practices that are present in practice and explores suitability towards future challenges.
