- 2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

Several management scholars have given several definitions of motivation. According to Middle Most and Hit (1981), motivation is the willful desire to direct one’s behaviour towards goals. The three key elements in this definition are willful desire, (person’s choice) behaviour and goal - directed purpose of behaviour. Lakin Folajin (2001), spoke at motivation as term used generally when somebody is stimulated, the interest of a worker so as to be able to work and bring or breeds efficiency in his work. Robbins (2001) defines motivation as the forces that energizes, direct and sustains a person’s effort. Joena Agbato (1988) says motivation is an important determination of human behaviour, it sit that which moves one towards a goal, thus, motivation begat performance. Luthans (1998) motivation is a process which starts with a physiological or psychological deficiency or need that activates behavior at a drive that is aimed of a goal or incentive.

Motivation is an art targeted to getting people work willingly, and an art of inducing one to behave in a particular manner to achieve a task Mee-Edoiye and Andawei (2002) viewed motivation as a human engineering approached being triggered by the individual needs. Flippo (1982) defined motivation as a psychological process initiate by the emergence of needs involving a good directed action and behaviour aimed at satisfying a particular desire. It is inducement given to workers for higher output.

Motivation behaviour has three basic characteristics:-

- 1. It is sustained – it is maintained for a long time – until satisfied. 2. It is goal directed – it seeks to achieve an objective. 3. It results from – felt need – an urge directed towards a need.

Several authors including Robert and Gene Neuport (1995), Williams (1997) and Cole (1990) have propounded theories to help to understand the human being and how to handle them to get goals achieved.
