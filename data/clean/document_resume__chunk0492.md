# Performance Appraisal

- 1. The performance appraisal system should be formally developed, thoroughly documented, and as objective as possible

2

The standards of performance for all positions being appraised must be based on the results of a thorough, formal lob analysis.

- 3. Relevant job dimensions and desired job performance should be reflected in each performance standard.

- 4. The appraisal process should involve the measurement of performance with the weighting of each dimension or criterion fixed prior to the utilization of the appraisal system.'

Throut,!1,1ut these qualities is found the notion that the performance appraisal pro- cedure is inextrrably linked to the nature of the job or performance being appraised. The preferred metood for assuring that the performance appraisal is not only conceptu- ally and philosophically congruent but also directly related to the actual performance being appraised is some form of job or task analysis. The first section of this chapter will address job analysis as it serves as the basis for the development of the overall per- formance appraisal system and most specifi,:ally for the development of the evaluative criteria with which the system operates. Issues surrounding the choice, adaptation, and/or development of a performance appraisal system will be explored in the second section of the chapter Specific measurement ism. ;s regarding performance appraisal with specific attention to reliability and validity as well as sources of error will con- clude this chapter.
