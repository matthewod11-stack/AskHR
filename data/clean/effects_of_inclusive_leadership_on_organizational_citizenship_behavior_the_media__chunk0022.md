## Organizational learning culture as a mediator

We argue that organizational learning culture mediates the rela- tionship between inclusive leadership and OCB. An inclusive leader’s openness to input from employees promotes continuous learning because employees have ample opportunities to extend their knowledge, expertise, and skills (Carmeli et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2015). A leader’s openness, accessibility, and availability to discuss matters with employees also help to foster a shared vision (Real et al., 2014) because intensified interactions between a leader and employees generate an understanding and clarity of organiza- tional goals (Zagorsek et al., 2009). This suggests that inclusive leadership catalyzes organizational learning culture. An organiza- tional learning culture constitutes advantageous conditions for employee OCB because peer interaction in knowledge acquisition and distribution aids peer cohesion (Li et al., 2010). Further, organizational learning culture supplies employees with rich opportunities to master new knowledge (Yang et al., 2004) and thus enhances employees’ feelings of receiving favorable treatment from their organization. Under the lens of social exchange theory, employees are more likely to reciprocate with the organization by performing OCB (Aryee et al., 2002). Based on the above rea- soning, we form Hypothesis 7: Organizational learning culture mediates the influence of inclusive leadership on employees’ organizational citizenship behaviors.
