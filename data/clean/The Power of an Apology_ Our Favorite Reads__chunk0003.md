colonization, unwanted wars, and much foreign intervention,must look out for each other. Even in tough times, I was raised toempathize with others and to try to see the good in people.A renowned poet and essayist in Korea, Jung Min Cho, says in hispoem,

Human Is Gift, that those three echoes “cause miracles,”but when we don’t use them, they “become difficult anduncomfortable to use.”When I moved to the U.S. as a young adult, I heard a differentperspective. “

Stop apologizing,” my peers and professors said tome. “As women, we’re socialized to reflexively apologize from ayoung age, sometimes simply for taking up space. It’s a habit thatneeds to change.”I understood what they were saying: As women, we shouldn’thave to apologize for existing — in any space — but at the sametime, I wondered: Is the apology really the problem? Has sayingsorry ever hurt someone, made someone feel excluded, ordestroyed a community or relationship?While the topic is culturally nuanced, I do believe that having thecourage and compassion to make a

genuine apology is a distinctlynoble quality, no matter your gender. Can you not think of a timewhen you wished someone would just say sorry? Have youexperienced the healing an honest apology can bring?Apologizing is a complex and remarkable ability, one thatrequires

deep reflection, self-awareness,

empathy, and courage.Aren’t all those things we wish we saw more in the world today?
