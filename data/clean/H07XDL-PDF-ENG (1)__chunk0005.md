## employees and managers, C-suite executives, board members, and

retirees — to help them develop their individual life strategies.

You can create a life strategy at any time, but it can feel especially

appropriate at certain milestones — a school graduation, the start of

your ﬁrst job, a promotion, becoming an empty-nester, retiring — or

after a major life event, such as a health scare, a divorce, the loss of a job,

a midlife crisis, or the death of a loved one. When you have a strategy,

you will be better able to navigate all those transitions and diﬃcult

moments, building resilience and ﬁnding more joy and fulﬁlment while

minimizing stress. This article will help you get started.
