# Who is Covered

These regulations apply to employers who wish to import temporary nonagricultural workers to work in

temporary jobs in the United States when U.S. workers are not available. The INA requires the Department of

Homeland Security (DHS) to consult with appropriate government agencies to determine eligibility for the H-

2B program, and DHS has determined that eﬀective administration of the H-2B program requires consultation with the Department of Labor (DOL) to advise whether U.S. workers capable of performing the temporary

services or labor are available before determining whether any worker can be admitted. The INA also provides

that the number of aliens during any ﬁscal year who can be issued visas or provided nonimmigrant status

cannot exceed 66,000.
