# Personality in Multilevel Theories

A ﬁnal theme that is apparent across a number of chapters in this book is recognition of the increasing examination of the role of per- sonality in organizational life across multiple levels of analysis. Ex- plicit examples can be found in Stewart’s chapter (Chapter Seven) on the multilevel role of personality in teams, Hough’s discussion of group-level personality predictor variables in Chapter Eleven, Day and Kilduff’s discussion in Chapter Eight of self-monitoring and dyadic work relationships, and Ryan and Kristof-Brown’s dis- cussion in Chapter Ten of organizational personality in person- organization ﬁt research. But multiple levels of analysis also enter into the models presented in many other chapters (Lucas and Diener in Chapter Two, Barrick et al. in Chapter Three, Johnson in Chapter Four, Cullen and Sackett in Chapter Six, and Ford and Oswald in Chapter Nine), as many of the situational antecedents and other moderators proposed in their models are group-level or organizational-level characteristics of environments. Thus, this book makes clear that the traditional focus on the individual level, which permeates research on personality and work, is being supplanted with a richer understanding of personality and work that incorpo- rates multilevel theorizing.

What are the implications of incorporating multiple levels into our theories and research on personality and work? Kozlowski and Klein (2000) noted, “Virtually all organizational phenomena are embedded in a higher-level context, which often has either direct or moderating effects on lower-level processes and outcomes. Rel- evant contextual features and effects from the higher level should be incorporated into theoretical models” (p. 15). This principle is applied in a number of the models presented in this book. Lucas and Diener (Chapter Two) mention the nature of the job as a moderator of the happy worker–productive worker hypothesis, Bar- rick et al. (Chapter Three) discuss cooperative and competitive de- mands, Johnson (Chapter Four) mentions situational moderators
