# The Risks of Scaling Early

In our recent research, we analyzed large-scale data from Burning

Glass Technologies and Crunchbase. This data included 6.3 million job

postings from 2010 to 2019 listed by 38,217 U.S.-founded startups. We

discovered that when startups begin scaling, they typically hire their

ﬁrst manager and salesperson to coordinate a growing workforce and

expand their customer base.

Leveraging this insight, we used the ﬁrst job postings for these two

roles to capture the timing of when a startup begins to scale. Our

analyses revealed that early scaling (within the ﬁrst 12 months of

founding) increases the risk of failure by 20 to 40%. Furthermore,

this risk of failure is particularly prominent for two-sided platform

companies. However, we also found that when startups incorporate
