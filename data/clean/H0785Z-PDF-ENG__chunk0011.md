## Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., CEO of Ford’s major competitor, General Motors

(GM), decided to pursue a new strategy by oﬀering diﬀerent makes and

models of cars for every budget in a range of styles and colors. GM

used consumer research to segment the market, but it always kept the

focus on markets large enough to ensure the manufacturing would be

cost-eﬀective. To manage multiple products and brands, Sloan realized

that GM needed a diﬀerent organizational structure too — one with

divisions that each had a top leader responsible for proﬁt and loss (P&L).

After World War II, large companies became even larger as they

extended their sales and production and built networks of suppliers

(what we now call “ecosystems”) in countries and even on continents

other than their own. Many multinational corporations adopted a

P&L organization structure to maintain control of their sprawling
