Second, the perceived loss of job autonomy can make employees feel

less secure. After a large sanitation products wholesaler in Ontario,

Canada introduced video surveillance systems to promote safety and

optimize walking routes, warehouse workers told us that they felt a loss

of trust and meaningfulness in their work. While they would usually

take alternate routes to reorganize inventory and to check in on fellow

workers, employees were now worried that not complying with the

suggested walking routes could invite scrutiny or punitive actions.

Regulatory compliance is usually an insuﬃcient measure of whether

data collection may cause harm. The forms of data collection enabled

by technologies that gather biometric data are much more invasive,

intimate, and intrusive than those traditionally covered by data

privacy regulations. While new laws that target how organizations

handle biometric data are being passed—Illinois’ Biometric Information

Privacy Act (BIPA), for instance—regulations are generally still playing

catch up.
