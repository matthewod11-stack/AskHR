# Sample

The sample consisted of 27 leaders of a large healthcare system in the United States who were enrolled in a 2-day executive education course on inclusive leadership. Although professional development credits were received for participation in the course, participation in the survey was voluntary. The sample included low-to-mid-level managers (e.g., program ofÔ¨Åcer, senior coordinator, manager, and director) and had an average of 30 direct reports (including temporary workers, contractors, part-time workers, and volun- teers). The sample was 70% female and 90% white.
