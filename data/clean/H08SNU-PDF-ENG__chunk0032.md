# Introduce subtractive design challenges

Subtractive design challenges shift problem-solving away from

accumulation and toward essential value. Rather than asking teams how

to improve a process by adding new elements, ask how the same result

can be achieved with fewer steps, features, or constraints.

Consolidation allows teams to condense workﬂows into fewer steps

without loss of quality. Substitution invites smaller, more elegant

solutions that are easier to use and maintain. Abstraction encourages

replacing complex interfaces with simpler alternatives. Each of these

approaches supports eﬃciency by reducing operational drag. They also

support resilience, since simpler systems are less prone to failure and
