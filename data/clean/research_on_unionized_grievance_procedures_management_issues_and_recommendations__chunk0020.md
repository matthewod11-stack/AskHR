# Economics Research

While economists have long studied the ef- fects of unions on pay and other bargaining outcomes (see, for example, Rees, 1977), economists’ focus on grievance procedures developed relatively recently and is largely guided by Hirschman’s (1970) model of exit, voice, and loyalty. Hirschman addressed the question of why some customers who are dissatisfied with a firm’s products do not switch to other firms as microeconomic theory would predict but, instead, express their dissatisfaction to the “original” firm with the objective of having the sources of their dissatisfaction (such as product price, quality, or availability) corrected. In this model, switching is exit behavior, express- ing dissatisfaction is voice behavior, and loy- alty is posited to be negatively related to exit and positively related to voice.

Other researchers reach conclusions dif- ferent from those of Freeman and Medoff (1984) in so far as the effects of grievance procedures on productivity are concerned. For example, Ichniowski (1992, 1986) found a strong negative relationship between grievance rates and monthly tons of paper produced in nine unionized paper mills over the 1976-82 period. Katz, Kochan, & Weber (1985) and Katz, Kochan, & Gobeille (1983) found strong negative relationships between grievance rates and plant performance (including productiv- ity and product quality) in two sets of General Motors assembly plants during the 1970s. Norsworthy & Zabala (1985) found the griev- ance rate to be significantly negatively related to total factor productivity and significantly positively related to unit production costs in the United States’ automobile industry be- tween 1959 and 1976.

Some of these authors (e.g., Katz, Kochan, & Gobeille, 1983) propose that their findings
