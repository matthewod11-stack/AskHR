# Creating a Structured Interview

To create a structured interview, information about the job is obtained (job analysis) and questions are created that are designed to find out the extent to which appli- cants’ skills and experiences match those needed to successfully perform the job. These questions are incorporated into an interview form used by all interviewers for all applicants. Examples of good and bad answers are located next to the ques- tions to help an interviewer score the answers given by applicants.

Determining the KSAOs to Tap in the Interview The first step in creating a structured interview is to conduct a thorough job analysis and write a detailed job description. As discussed in Chapter , the job analysis should identify the tasks performed, the conditions under which they are performed, and the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteris- tics (KSAOs) needed to perform the tasks. The second step is to determine the best way to measure an applicant’s ability to perform each of the tasks identified in the job analysis. Some of the KSAOs can be appropriately measured in an interview; others will need to be tapped through such methods as psychologi- cal tests, job samples, assessment centers, references, background checks, and training and experience ratings (these other methods will be thoroughly discussed in Chapter ). For example, suppose a job description for a receptionist indicated that the primary tasks included typing reports, filing correspondence, answer- ing the phone, and dealing with people visiting the organization. Typing ability might best be measured with a typing test, filing correspondence with a filing test, answering the phone with a job sample, and customer service with an inter- view question. The important point here is that not every KSAO can or should be tapped in an interview. To practice this process, use the job description in Chapter  (Table .) to complete Exercise . in your workbook and determine the KSAOs you would tap in an interview.

Creating Interview Questions As shown in Figure ., there are six types of interview questions: clarifiers, dis- qualifiers, skill-level determiners, past-focused, future-focused, and organizational fit. Clarifiers allow the interviewer to clarify information in the résumé, cover letter, and application, fill in gaps, and obtain other necessary information. Because each applicant’s résumé and cover letter are unique, specific clarifiers are not standard across applicants. For example, an interviewer may need to ask one
