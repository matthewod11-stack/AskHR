Don’t Lean, she could take a moment to breathe, which could help her

neutralize her activation by the CEO and keep a clear head. We were all

surprised that asking about Lean With was what pivoted Isobel into a

new way of operating. Drawing on Harvard Business School professor

Amy Edmondson’s groundbreaking work on psychological safety, we

asked, “What if your job at the board meeting was to make the CEO and

directors feel safe?”

Isobel immediately embraced that approach, which appealed to

her protective side. She spontaneously started thinking through the

implications. Supporting the CEO would probably help him calm down

and make the meetings less painful for everyone. In the Lean With

stance, she could also tolerate his contradictions by understanding

that his ﬁrst reaction wasn’t always his ﬁnal word. She decided that

she would enthusiastically support his comments when they were

in alignment with the executive committee’s assessment and refrain

from reﬂexively challenging him when he veered oﬀ course, unless

the board was close to a vote on that recommendation. After adopting

this approach, her reputation with the board skyrocketed. She became

known as a leader who made peace rather than war.
