In this set of anchors, the distance between all pairs of adjacent anchors ranges from 1.5 to 2.3 points. Note, however, that the use of the anchor “terrible” has a very neg- ative connotation such that we may want to use a less negative anchor such as “bad” or “inferior.” In this case, we would be choosing an anchor that is closer to the next one (“unsatisfactory”) than we may wish, but using the new anchor may lead to less defen- sive and overall negative reactions on the part of employees who receive this rating.

In summary, behavior checklists are easy to use and to understand.26 On the other hand, detailed and useful feedback is difficult to extract from the numerical rating provided. Overall, however, the practical advantages of checklists probably account for their current widespread popularity.

Every job includes some critical behaviors that make a crucial difference between doing a job effectively and doing it ineffectively. The critical incidents measurement approach involves gathering reports of situations in which employees exhibited behav- iors that were especially effective or ineffective in accomplishing their jobs.27 The recorded critical incidents provide a starting point for assessing performance. For example, consider the following incident as recorded by a high school principal regard- ing the performance of Tom Jones, the head of the disability services office:

Asophomore with learning disabilities was experiencing difficulty in writing. Her parents wanted a laptop computer for her. Tom Jones ordered a computer and it was delivered to the student’s teacher. No training was provided to the child, her teacher, or her parents. The laptop was never used.

This recorded incident is actually the synthesis of a series of incidents:

- 1. A problem was detected (a student with a special need was identified). 2. Corrective action was taken (the computer was ordered). 3. Corrective action was initially positive (the computer was delivered). 4. Corrective action was subsequently deficient (the computer was not used because of the lack of training).
