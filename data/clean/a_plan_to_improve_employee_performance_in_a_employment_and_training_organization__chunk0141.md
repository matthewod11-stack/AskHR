# training , job search activities, etc.).

All three of these elements must be present in the clients file in order to complete

an intake, and the data again can be gathered from the clients' files. The standard can be

files that address 2 out of 3 major elements are an acceptable level of performance .

Clar~ty of Work/Documentation - Clarity of work refers to the extent that an

employee's work is clear, legible and understandable. This means that if a counselor or

32

supervisor picks up a particular file, they can understand what went on in that intake or

interview. They would not need any further information or explanation about a particular

intake file. Specifically, we are measuring the degree to which files are:

- 1. Legible; and

- 2. Understandable.

Quantity of Work- What we are measuring is inputs and outputs, the extent to

which the number of intakes that were seen and completed. It would be invalid to

measure quantity of work based on outputs, because often counselors are unable to

complete an intake for reasons beyond the counselor' s control. Meaning not every client

that a counselor sees is the same and they may have issues that would prevent counselors

to enroll them into a program, therefore we would refer the client to other community

agencies as appropriate. Another indicator of output, can include the number of referrals

made to other community agencies.

First, an average tally per week of the number of intakes seen, completed and

referred can be kept by the employee, recorded on the sign-in sheet, and evaluated by the

supervisor. Quantity is defined by the number of customers/clients seen, output is

defined by the number of intakes completed, or referred (this would be up to management

to decide if they would want to include the number of referrals as an output measure).

The formula to be used is the total number of intakes divided by the population of

counselors (this can also be tallied as to what was the FTE a counselor solely did intakes

for the week - meaning if fifty percent of his or her time was in intake, than we would

only count that counselor as .50 into the population, when doing the formula).

The following formula can be used :
