## key takeaways, particularly around small group meetings.

Returning to the ofﬁce did not reduce virtual meetings.

Many of the organizations in this analysis implemented substantial

return to oﬃce policies over the past two to three years. We anticipated

a drop in virtual meeting volume, but that wasn’t the case. In 2021,

employees attended an average of 8.3 meetings per week, which jumped

to 10.32 in 2022. 2023 saw a slight reduction to 10.1, mostly driven by

fewer 1:1s (the easiest to replace when fully in-person).

This number staying high represents an important shift in employee

preference. By default, most meeting invites include a virtual link and

participants will often choose to join via video even when others are in

the same oﬃce. Some also prefer virtual meetings because they allow

for recording, transcription, and AI note summaries that aren’t available
