## The African Leadership Academy (ALA), a pioneering boarding school

in Johannesburg, experienced this ﬁrsthand. Ten years after ALA

opened, its cofounder, Chris Bradford, decided to step back for an entire academic year to accompany his ﬁancée to Europe while she

completed her master’s degree. When he returned, Chris discovered that

the school’s operations had ﬂourished in his absence, but its fundraising

eﬀorts had fallen oﬀ a cliﬀ. In response, he promoted the person who’d

been handling operations to be ALA’s permanent COO. Then he turned

his attention to soliciting donations for the school’s upcoming gala and

training others to better ﬁll this role. He set a personal goal to transfer

the role to a colleague within three years so that he could move to the United States, where his ﬁancée would soon start an academic job.

Chris’s sabbatical marked the beginning of the end of his time at ALA.
