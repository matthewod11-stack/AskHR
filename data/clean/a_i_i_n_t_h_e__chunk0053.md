# Product Note: OperatorÇ

Operator is an example of OpenAI’s agentic approach. Leveraging its own virtual browser, Operator can navigate the web, click on buttons, Êll in forms, and gather data just like a human would¿

It can also run processes across a wide range of tools and systems—no need for custom integrations or APIs. Enterprises use it to automate work¶ows that previously required human intervention, such asg

Automating software testing and QA using Operator to interact with web appsÄ like a real user, ·agging any UI issues¾

Updating systems of record on behalf of users, without technical instructionsÄ or API connections¾

The result: end-to-end automation, freeing teams from repetitive tasks and boosting eÁciency across the enterprise.
