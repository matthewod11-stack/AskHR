## In the age of AI, low-code application-building tools, and access to

outsourced engineering teams, having a cofounder with technical

expertise is far less critical than it was only a few years ago. Many

founders are now able to build minimum viable products (MVPs)

without any technical skills, and investors are beginning to relax their

requirement that nontechnical founders have a cofounder in the CTO

role. First Round Capital partner Liz Wessel put it this way: “There

are times when I’m OK with a lack of ‘technical chops’ among the

founding team—usually when the cofounders have unique or deep

domain experience and have shown some ability to work with engineers

in the past.” That was the case for two of my former students at

HBS, Ilana Borkenstein and Eric Gruskin, who launched their nurse

workforce management and scheduling company, M7 Health, in 2022.

Borkenstein, who serves as the company’s CEO, was a registered nurse

before graduate school, and Gruskin, who serves as COO, had been a

management consultant and had worked for many years in the back oﬃce of his mother’s clinic. Although neither founder had a technical

background, both had deep industry experience. They were able to hire

engineers to build their ﬁrst MVP, expand to 30 hospitals nationwide,

and ultimately raise a $4 million seed round in 2024, led by First Round

Capital. “We did not hesitate to back this incredible team when we saw

what they accomplished leveraging modern tools and hiring engineers

to launch their MVP, despite not having a CTO,” said Wessel.
