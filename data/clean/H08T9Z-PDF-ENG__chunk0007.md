Alex knew instantly he messed up. But instead of running to his boss’s

oﬃce to apologize, he took time to reﬂect on his behavior and the

emotions he felt about her, not just that he mistakenly sent the email.

and that reaction had fueled his impulsive email. That helped him

but to move the meeting along in a timely fashion.
