## Between electronic screening and recruiters less familiar with

relauncher proﬁles and resumes, it is not uncommon for recent

volunteer experiences and coursework to be mistaken for current work

experience, instead of a valid career break. There’s an irony here: by

taking steps to camouﬂage their career breaks on resumes, job seekers

are inadvertently setting themselves up for rejection by employer career

reentry programs because their career breaks are not obvious enough.

Now LinkedIn has given relaunchers the perfect mechanism with which

to call out the career break on their LinkedIn proﬁles and employers the

means to avoid missing another Simone.
