my productivity when working remotely?” If your manager voices a

concern, you can ask, “What are your thoughts on how I might address

this?” Or, better yet, proactively suggest a solution.

- Finally, rewire yourself to listen and repeat. Your thoughts about

your manager or coworkers may be clouded, especially if there’s

tension or if you’ve worked with them for a long time. If that’s the case,

you’ll need to be intentional about not letting your biases distort your

understanding of a situation. Summarize what you’re hearing from

others with phrasing like, “So what I’m understanding is…” or “What

I hear you saying is…” By listening closely and repeating what you

hear, you’ll increase the likelihood of being on the same page, be better

prepared to empathize, and be able to go into future conversations
