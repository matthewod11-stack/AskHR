Humans are evolutionary generalists, selected to navigate half-drawn

maps. We don’t merely survive unknown unknowns—we thrive on

them, and that resilience is our deﬁning edge. Over countless

generations we ﬁne-tuned our vocal cords and social brains until

language emerged—opening the door to cumulative knowledge,

abstract reasoning, and symbolic thought. From there we pushed

beyond our biological limits, forging tools that stretched our senses,

expanded our memory, and multiplied our abilities.

But the cornerstone of our advantage is our highly plastic, densely

wired prefrontal cortex. This neural command center lets us spin
