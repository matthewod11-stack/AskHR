# Foreword

This is the nineteenth book in a series initiated by the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology in 1983 (SIOP) and pub- lished by Jossey-Bass. Originally published as the Frontiers Series, the SIOP Executive Committee voted in 2000 to change the name of the series to Organizational Frontiers Series in order to enhance the identity and visibility of the series. The purpose of the publi- cation of series volumes in a general sense was to promote the sci- entiﬁc status of the ﬁeld. Ray Katzell ﬁrst edited the series, and Irwin Goldstein and Sheldon Zedeck followed him.

The editorial board chooses the topics of the volumes and the volume editors. The series editor and the editorial board then work with the volume editor in planning the volume and, occasionally, in suggesting and selecting chapter authors and content. During the writing of the volume, the series editor often works with the ed- itor and the publisher to bring the manuscript to completion.

The success of the series is evident in the high number of sales (now over forty-ﬁve thousand). Volumes have received excellent reviews, and individual chapters as well as volumes have been cited frequently. A recent symposium at the SIOP annual meeting exam- ined the impact of the series on research and theory in industrial/ organizational (I/O) psychology. Although such inﬂuence is difﬁ- cult to track and volumes have varied in intent and perceived cen- trality to the discipline, the conclusion of most participants was that the volumes have exerted a signiﬁcant impact on research and the- ory in the ﬁeld and are regarded as being representative of the best the ﬁeld has to offer.

Another purpose of the series was to bring scientiﬁc research from other disciplines to bear on problems of interest to I/O psy- chologists. This volume, edited by Murray Barrick and Ann Marie Ryan, provides an in-depth examination of the role of personality
