# The fact

Jerel Slaughter: I think that the use of different methods is an issue. It is harder to get papers containing lab studies in to JAP and PPsych, or the Academy of Manage- mentJournal (AMJ) and AdministrativeSci- enceQuarterly (ASQ), which are arguably the ﬂagship I-O and management journals, respectively. Lab studies do get published, of course, but I suspect that the rejection rates are higher for lab studies, although I do not have data to support this assertion. This comes mostly from my experience as a reviewer. I am pretty sure that my per- sonal rejection rate (as both an author and a reviewer) is higher for laboratory studies than for ﬁeld studies.

The problem for JDM is that, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., Hayward & Hambrick, 1997), it is prohibitively difﬁcult to sample enough real-world decisions to make passive observation a realistic option as a research method for studying decision making. Commentaries by Scott and Dan (Highhouse, 2009; Ilgen, 1986) are particularly instructive here: In JDM, as in some other areas of research, laboratory work is absolutely necessary for many reasons. It allows for conclusions of cause- and-effect, it is efﬁcient and inexpensive, it allows researchers to study phenomena that cannot be studied in the ﬁeld, and perhaps most importantly, it allows us to ask the ‘‘Can it happen?’’ question (Mook, 1983).

So it is fairly clear what the obstacles are: As several of us have discussed, there does seem to be a bias against the simple laboratory studies that are common to JDM, and this makes it more the difﬁcult journals that are most visible to IOOB researchers. But I suppose that there are also opportunities that are created by this bias. For example, it probably pushes those researchers doing work in the lab or with ‘‘paper people’’ types of studies to be more creative in their work, to increase mundane realism, and to employ new experimental manipulations. For example, we would deﬁnitely know a lot less about the effects of accountability on decision making (see, if people e.g., Lerner & Tetlock, 1999)
