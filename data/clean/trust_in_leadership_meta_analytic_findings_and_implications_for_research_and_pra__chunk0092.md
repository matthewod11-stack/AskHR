# Limitations

As is the case in all meta-analyses, readers should use caution in drawing strong conclusions regarding the estimates of individual effect sizes in cases where N and k are smaller (Oswald & Johnson, 1998). We note that the sample sizes in this study are, however, in line with those reported in meta-analyses of other variables in the literature (e.g., Brown, 1996; Gerstner & Day, 1997; Lee et al., 2000; Mathieu & Zajac, 1990; Organ & Ryan, 1995). In cases size becomes most problematic—moderator where tests—we suggest examining the pattern of results across variables to draw conclusions about the effects of referent and definition as moderators. These tests tend to provide a fairly consistent set of results, showing effects in most categories. As the literature on trust grows, these results may be further explored. We believe that this meta-analysis represents an important step in helping the literature grow.
