Drivers and factors influencing EX

By reviewing available literature from different areas and sources such as positive,

humanistic, and behavioral psychology, the present research found the concept of

employee experience to be the whole perspective of employee life at work and it

demands regular and authentic feedback, action, and monitoring. Belonging, purpose,

accomplishment, happiness, and vigor have been recognized as the fundamental

aspects of employee experience. These aspects are a starting point for determining

drivers and results of EX. Based on Jacob Morgan, EX consists of seventeen

characteristics that may be categorized into three groups: "ACE technology, COOL

physical environments, and CELEBRATED culture." (Morgan, 2017, p. 13) More than

150 companies around the world had their top executives interviewed for this study,

and the researchers looked at 17 different aspects of employee experience. These

included: accessibility, products, organizational needs versus company needs, the

ability to invite guests, possibility for flexibility, a commitment to employees' health

and well-being and the role of leaders at all levels as coaches and mentors. In this

research, the multiplicity of culture, technology, and physical space is linked to a

positive employee experience. The researcher emphasized that "technology can

either empower people or make them powerless"
