their effects. As Johnson states, self-regulatory processes are im- portant for several reasons. They are strongly related to personality, they help explain how people overcome habits, and they account for situations where those with similar ability, knowledge, goals, and desires differ in their performance levels.

Other chapters also suggest mediational links between per- sonality and criteria of interest. For example, Cullen and Sackett (Chapter Six) discuss how a motivational variable (a motive to comply with norms) might be a mediator between personality and counterproductive work behaviors, but they also discuss attitudi- nal and affective constructs as potential mediators of these rela- tions. The complexity of their model reﬂects the complexity of the inﬂuence of personality on work behavior.

In proposing and examining mediational processes in these models, we think Weiss and Kurek’s admonishment in Chapter Five is important to consider: a productive analysis will tie together ex- isting constructs (for example, well-accepted personality traits and well-accepted motivational constructs) rather than create new in- dividual difference measures. Furthermore, we note the ongoing discussion in the self-regulatory literature of considering motiva- tional individual differences, such as goal orientation, as traits or as states. Models that explain personality as operating through mo- tivational processes will eventually need to clarify whether the in- ﬂuence is on motivational traits or motivational states.

The theme that situations must be more fully accounted for as moderators of the personality-motivation and personality- performance relationships is present in a number of chapters as well. In the Barrick et al. model in Chapter Three, situational in- ﬂuences moderate the relationship between the three cognitive- motivational intentions and personality-performance relationships. Examples include whether the job involves cooperative or com- petitive demands and the degree of autonomy in the job. In the Johnson model in Chapter Four, situational moderators that can inﬂuence the magnitude of personality-performance relationships include situational strength, occupation, time on the job, and au- tonomy. Hough’s discussion in Chapter Eleven focuses on the ef- fects of situations such as type of task, type of team, type of job, culture, research setting, and ﬁt. Regardless of the speciﬁc type of situation, the theme across these chapters is that situational factors
