Studies that have explored whether these relationships vary by gender have come to contradictory results. On the one hand, female employees are more likely to question the equity of pay than their male colleagues because, in many cases, female employees are subject to unequal treatment (Graham and Welbourne, 1999). As a result, female employees might be less satisfied with their salaries and less committed towards their organizations than their male counterparts. On the other hand, despite the intuitive logic of this assumption, relatively few studies support it (Balkin and Gomez-Mejia, 2002; Nie et al., 2002; Peng et al., 2009). Since the results of the studies addressing the gender differences in reactions to pay inequity are inconsistent, further investigation is needed to shed light on the possible moderating effect of gender on the relationships between pay inequity and work- related attitudes, such as organizational commitment.
