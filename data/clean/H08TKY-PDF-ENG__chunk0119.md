# win.

A team begins by formulating options, or possibilities, and asks what

must be true for each to succeed. Once it has listed all the conditions,

it assesses their likelihood and thereby identiﬁes the barriers to each

choice. The team then tests the key barrier conditions to see which hold

true. From here, choosing a strategy is simple: The group reviews the

test results and chooses the possibility with the fewest serious barriers.

This is the path P&G took in the late 1990s, when it was looking to

become a major global player in skin care. After testing the barrier

conditions for several possibilities, it opted for a bold strategy that

might never have surfaced in the traditional process: reinventing Olay

as a prestige-like product also sold to mass consumers. The new

Olay succeeded beyond expectations—showing what can happen when

teams shift from asking “What is the right answer?” and focus instead

on ﬁguring out “What are the right questions?”
