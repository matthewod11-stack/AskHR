While the notion of existential equality represents a fundamental belief set within our culture, we remain heavily invested in meritocratic ideals. The notion that differential degrees of contribution rightly result in differ- ent outcomes is not going away, nor should it. Meritocracy is a major driver of capitalism; rewards for individual achievement are a profound human motivator, and ulti- mately an essential element of market driven free enter- prise systems.

Nonetheless, all social systems must strive to achieve a balance between agency, an individualistic self-serving orientation, and communion, an orientation in which the self is fused with others in a larger context (Rousseau and Arthur 1999). Balkan (1966) so argues, suggesting that social order, justice, and cohesion prevail when there is a balance between agency and communion. Keeley (1988) similarly notes that equity and equality are competing goals, the task of managers being to balance these. Mitchell and Scott (1990) note the creation of a sense of community to be an increasingly important problem area for modern organizations.

And yet, equality and equity often tend to be viewed as mutually exclusive. That is, equality rules are often pre- sumed to foreclose upon our ability to draw upon equity as a basis for distribution, and vice versa. But perhaps if we can come to view justice more systemically (when viewed in an organizational or societal context as a whole; e.g., Ambrose and Schminke 2009; Sheppard et al. 1992), then we can see how equity and equality function in tandem— are potentially harnessed synergistically. This point to the value of knowing how, and when, equity and equality may be complementary. Indeed the distributive practices pre- sented herein suggest that there exist a number of organi- zational spheres perfectly suitable for experimentation with forms of distributive equality, and suitable within the context of organizations functioning as goal driven, com- petitive enterprises.

Regarding the notion of balancing equality with equal- ity, this deals with the idea that equality is ultimately a deeply qualitative idea, and that it’s full pursuit ultimately entails an ongoing praxis. To this end, we need to contin- ually scrutinize existing forms and possibilities for dis- tributive equality in organizations, and compare these with the ideal of existential equality.

For example, consider organizations’ practice of having no reserved parking spaces. How much does this resonate with the concept of existential dignity? It does, but contrast this to an equalization of restroom facilities. Anyone who has entered an executive versus a workers’ lavatory gets a sense of striking qualitative differences—the former being very clean, very well appointed, perhaps with marble ﬂoors, and so forth. Here perhaps we touch a somewhat deeper nerve relative to the emotional meaning of equality.
