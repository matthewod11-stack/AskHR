# Groupthink

The term groupthink was coined by Janis () after studying the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of . The Bay of Pigs was the Cuban landing site for , Cuban exiles who sought to overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. The plan called for the U.S. Navy and Air Force to covertly protect the invasion force and its supply ships. The invaders, however, were met unexpectedly by , Cuban troops and were quickly killed or captured. The help promised by the U.S. govern- ment never appeared. Janis () proposed the concept of groupthink to explain how some of the nation’s brightest men could hatch such an ill-conceived plan.

With groupthink, members become so cohesive and like-minded that they make poor decisions despite contrary information that might reasonably lead them to other options. Groupthink most often occurs when the group

is cohesive is insulated from qualified outsiders has an illusion of invulnerability, infallibility, or both believes that it is morally superior to its adversaries is under great pressure to conform has a leader who promotes a favorite solution has gatekeepers who keep information from other group members.

Groupthink can be reduced in several ways. First, the group leader should not state his own position or beliefs until late in the decision-making process. Second, the leader should promote open discussion and encourage group members to speak. Third, a group or committee can be separated into sub- groups to increase the chance of disagreement. Finally, one group member can be assigned the job of devil’s advocate—one who questions and disagrees with the group.

As with most things in psychology, the potential for groupthink is compli- cated. Though cohesive groups with strong leaders often result in groupthink, there are situations in which these two characteristics result in high levels of group performance (Kerr & Tinsdale, ).
