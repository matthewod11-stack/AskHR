# Employee Rights

The Act grants employees several important rights. Among them are the right to ﬁle a complaint with OSHA

about safety and health conditions in their workplaces and, to the extent permitted by law, have their identities kept conﬁdential from employers; contest the amount of time OSHA allows for correcting violations of

standards; and participate in OSHA workplace inspections.
