sensitivity of the measures in relation to their applica- tion, more instrument validation and specification is required. The cultural validation of these already-in- use tools for usage in a variety of nations would improve awareness and comprehension of the potential universality of culture in the workplace.

The findings of the current investigation serve as a foundation for upcoming research on the effect of orga- nizational characteristics and provide a roadmap for how such research should proceed. More study is needed focusing on a clear definition of culture such as clan cul- ture or hierarchy culture with personal traits, dark per- sonality and employees experience as mediator and moderator to gain deeper understanding on deviant workplace behavior. Future studies could afford to explore other criteria to expand the sample size for sys- tematic review to attain a larger sample in order to advance research on the effect of workplace culture on deviant workplace behavior.

This study has the potential to make a contribution to the body of research that focuses on workplace culture as a possible instigator of employee deviant behavior in the workplace. The gathering of data on workplace cul- ture and its effect on deviances will be beneficial to both public and private sector organizations because it has been established that workplace culture plays a vital role in preventing the manifestation of deviant workplace behavior.
