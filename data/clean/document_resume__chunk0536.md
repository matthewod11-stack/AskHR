Nonetheless, an instrument which appears to be relevant certainly meets with more acceptance than does one that seems foreign or unrelated to one's job performance.

The final validity issue that might be addressed is that of convergent /discriminant validity.40 With multiple measures of many of the traits, attributes, and behaviors contained in a performance appraisal process, such a N alidity study is most appropnate.

The reliability issue regarding performance appraisals must be addressed from two perspectives: (1) reliability of the instrument and (2) inter-rater reliability. Osgood, Succi, and Tannenbaum used factor analytic studies to test for internal consistency.4t Currently, the coefficient alpha is in wide use to test for internal consistency.42

The issue of inter-rater reliability is ii serious Lonsiderationind the primary vari- able affecting it is training in the use of the procedure. That issue is addressed in Chapter 6, which focuses on minimizing rater errors.
