# 36 CHELLADURAI AND SALEH

the training period is much shorter in duration. A second distinguishing charac- teristic of team sports is that the organizational rewards, namely winning, is denied to at least one of the contestants. Thus, the members of a team continu- ously strive for a reward with the realization that they may be deprived of it either through superior performance of the opponents or pure chance. Finally, the relatively brief existence for a team is yet a third distinguishing characteristic. Members of an athletic team are assembled for only about 3 to 6 months.

There have been two studies conducted to identify the salient dimensions of leader behavior in sports. Danielson, Zelhart, and Drake (1975) administered a questionnaire containing 140 items modified from the original Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (Hemphill & Coons, 1957) to 160 junior and senior high school hockey players. The results of the factor analysis and multidimen- sional scaling led the authors to conclude that "when perceived coaching behav- iors are grouped on the basis of co-occurrence, the number of underlying dimensions is between 8 and 20" (Danielson et al., p. 332). Chelladurai and Saleh (1978), using 160 students enrolled in physical education degree programs at a Canadian University, derived and used a leadership scale consisting of five factors of coaching behavior.

Although these two studies do represent a promising start, unfortunately, neither of the studies presented evidence of the reliability and validity of the scales used. Moreover, the samples were limited and therefore, may not give an adequate indication of coaching behavior in different types of sports. The present paper is an attempt to deal with the above mentioned problems by refining the Leadership Scale for Sports (LSS) used by Chelladurai and Saleh (1978). This refinement consisted of determining the reliability and validity of this revised LSS scale.
