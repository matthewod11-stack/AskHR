Ideally, a skilled,ND-aware person will address the bothersome conduct. Situationslike this should be handled with sensitivity and address thebehavior itself and its effect on others without passing judgementor assigning motivation to the individual.

This is one of those areas where there’s a lot of variability betweenwhat works best for one person versus another, but as a generalrule, you can’t go wrong with

keeping your language free of

euphemisms, sarcasm, and vagueness. I’ll never forget the timemy mother asked my (then undiagnosed) autistic boyfriend whowas living with us, “Do you want to take out the trash?” and to herhorror, he simply answered, “No,” and went back to what he wasdoing.

It’s especially important tobe mindful of the environment, as background noise and othersensory input can make it more difficult for us to process what isbeing said.
