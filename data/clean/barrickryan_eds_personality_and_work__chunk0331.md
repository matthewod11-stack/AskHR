# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 105

Conscientiousness showing the strongest relationships. Less research has examined personality correlates of goal commitment. Hollen- beck and Klein (1987) suggested need for achievement, Type A per- sonality, self-esteem, and locus of control as indirect determinants of goal commitment. Partial support for this model was provided by Hollenbeck, Williams, and Klein (1989), who found that com- mitment to difÔ¨Åcult goals was stronger when individuals were high in need for achievement and had an internal locus of control. In other studies, need for achievement (Kernan & Lord, 1988) and Conscientiousness (Barrick et al., 1993) were positively related to goal commitment.
