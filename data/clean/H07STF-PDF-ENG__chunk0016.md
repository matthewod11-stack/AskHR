# else in parallel.

The ﬁrst clear bit of advice and way of doing this successfully is to come

up with a list of possibilities. I call them your possible selves. And start

exploring one, two, ideally more than one, in parallel.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I had a conversation with a headhunter at one point, and they were

asking me about my job. I told them it ticks all my boxes. I feel

good about it. I feel like I’m doing something important. And I said,

“Everyone feels that, right?” And the person said nobody feels that.

If you’re in a situation like that, you’re very lucky. I’m interested

about the extent to which people feel satisﬁed in their work. How

much satisfaction can we expect from our work? It’s work and it’s not

necessarily our life, although it’s a part of it.
