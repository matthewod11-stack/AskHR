CQ is deﬁned as “global people skills” or the ability to behave appropriately and effectively in culturally different situations (Thomas 2006). While the conceptual deﬁnition is fairly well agreed upon, a model of the construct is not. Earley and Ang (2003) incorporated four factors to operationalize CQ, including cognitive intelli- gence, metacognitive intelligence, motivational intelligence, and behavioral intel- ligence. Cognitive intelligence refers to declarative knowledge of a particular culture, such as knowing nonverbal communication rules. Motivational intelligence focuses on the desire and effort put forth to learn and understand observations and experiences in unfamiliar sociocultural contexts, such as reading books to learn more information about normative workplace relationships between supervisors and subordinates. Metacognitive intelligence refers to knowing how to gain knowledge of the culture and understand how to apply it to the relevant sociocultural context. Behavioral intelligence refers to demonstrable actions in a given sociocultural context, such as bowing more steeply than a superior in Japan.

In contrast, Thomas (2006) operationalizes CQ with three factors, including knowledge, mindfulness, and behaviors. Thomas’s operationalization, similar to others’ operationalization of 3C (above), considers not only declarative and pro- cedural knowledge under the knowledge component, but also sensemaking and motivation. Motivation falls under knowledge, because it is a cognitive factor reﬂecting what a person wants or desires. Earley and Ang (2003), as stated above, distinguish between cognitive intelligence and motivational intelligence, whereby
