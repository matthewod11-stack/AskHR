# design in addition to Agent design.

Let’s go ahead and define these “ops” terms to help distinguish between them:

- Development and Operations (DevOps) is the practice of efficiently productionizing

deterministic software applications by integrating the elements of people, processes, and

technology. DevOps serves as the foundation for all the following terms.

- Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) builds upon the capabilities of DevOps and

concentrates on the efficient productionization of ML models. The primary distinction is

that the output of an ML model is non-deterministic and relies on the input data (garbage

in, garbage out).

- Foundation Model Operations (FMOps) expands upon the capabilities of MLOps

and focuses on the efficient productionization of pre-trained (trained from scratch) or

customized (fine-tuned) FMs.

- Prompt and Operations (PromptOps) is a subcategory of GenAIOps that focuses

on operationalizing prompts effectively. Its main additional capabilities include prompt

storage, lineage, metadata management (including evaluation scores), a centralized
