# Publication Trends

Continuing an earlier trend, the number of studies of individ- uals published both in general psychology journals and in “personality” journals (the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology and Character and Personality) declined during the 1930s and 1940s (G. W. Allport, 1940b; Shermer, 1985). Although early volumes of Character and Personality fea- tured studies using biographical and archival methods (Craik, 1986), this journal was atypical. Founded in 1932 by Robert Saudek, a European graphologist (Roback, 1935), it was originally international in scope and emphasized “psycho- diagnostics,” or character reading based on expressive be- havior (G. W. Allport, 1937b), an approach that received little attention from American researchers. Allport was on the edi- torial board of the journal, which published the studies of several students from his life history seminar (Cartwright & French, 1939; Polansky, 1941). By 1945, however, the newly renamed Journal of Personality had changed to reﬂect the interests of American personality psychologists. The new direction was signaled by the omission from the title of “character,” an older term preferred by many European psychologists (see Roback, 1927a). The proportion of studies of individuals declined sharply between the 1930s and the 1950s (Shermer, 1985).

Even among clinical psychologists, the status of case stud- ies remained marginal. Allport’s retirement as editor of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology was followed by another dramatic decrease in the number of studies of indi- viduals published in the journal (Shermer, 1985). Comment- ing on a pioneering book of clinical case studies (Burton & Harris, 1947), Dollard noted that it relied heavily on test ma- terial and was not “the much-needed book of illuminating case histories for the teacher of Abnormal Psychology” (1948, p. 541).
