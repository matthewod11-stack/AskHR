# ABSTRACT

The idea of a circular economy is becoming more popular in academia, business, and public

policy. A circular economy is an alternative economic model that reduces waste, pollution, and

the lack of resources. On the other hand, numerous studies have been studied under

Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO). The dimensions of EO, such as risk-taking, innovativeness and

proactivity, are studied to draw a relationship with Circular Practices. The literature study

examined the theories' ideas and ways of thinking about them. It also gave a framework that

pointed out the problems and the research gaps. The research design comprises of developing a

hypothetical model with Entrepreneurial Orientation as the exogenous variable to test the

endogenous variable of Firms Performance. In addition, Circular Practice targets Performance as

a mediating variable. The methodology used in this study is quantitative that contains a random

sample of Entrepreneurs in Tamil Nadu, India. The questionnaire is suggested for collecting and
