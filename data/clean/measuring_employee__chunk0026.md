# 4 Presenting and Interpreting Engagement

‘scores’

Managers often want to know whether their staff, overall, are engaged or not. In practice, there are different ways of presenting these (cid:513)overall(cid:514) results, all of which have the benefit of yielding a single figure or number that can be used for monitoring and comparisons:

■ Simply add up the percentage of those who express a positive view by selecting either the (cid:513)agree(cid:514) or (cid:513)strongly agree(cid:514) options in response to the engagement statements.

■ (cid:513)Net(cid:514) scores, where the percentage expressing disagreement/strong disagreement is subtracted from the percentage expressing agreement/strong agreement.

■ “ mean average score, derived via the allocation of (cid:513)scores(cid:514) to each response

category (eg with a five-point scale, (cid:513)strongly disagree(cid:514) is allocated (cid:343), (cid:513)disagree(cid:514) (cid:344), (cid:513)neither agree nor disagree(cid:514) (cid:345), (cid:513)agree(cid:514) (cid:346) and (cid:513)strongly agree(cid:514) (cid:347)(cid:508).

None of these methods are problem-free. The first ignores the distribution of those who strongly disagree, disagree or are neutral; the second discounts the size of the neutral pool; and the third assumes that the distance between each response category is equal. For all these reasons, it is recommended that the distribution or breakdown of employee responses for each statement is examined carefully, in addition to using the overall engagement indicator score.

The NHS staff survey uses the third way (i.e. mean average) of presenting engagement scores (see www.nhsstaffsurveys.com for more information). It does this by firstly calculating, for each individual, the mean score for each dimension of engagement. For example, if a respondent were to score 3, 3, and 4 (of a 1 – strongly disagree to 5 – strongly agree scale) for the three statements that measure the involvement dimension then their average score for involvement would be 3.33. The next stage is to calculate the respondent(cid:514)s overall engagement score by averaging the (cid:513)mean(cid:514) scores across the three dimensions. For example if the mean score for psychological engagement, involvement and advocacy were 3.50, 3.33, 4.00 respectively then the overall engagement score would be 3.61.

To produce the Trust(cid:514)s overall engagement score, a weighting procedure is used. This is because NHS Trusts vary in the proportions and distributions of staff groups, and response rates overall and for each staff group; without weighting, the results might not comparable for benchmarking purposes. This may not seem problematic, but it has been found that staff groups differ in the way they perceive aspects of their work environment (Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006). More specifically, within the NHS overall staff engagement levels seem to vary across staff groups. West and Dawson (2012) found that ambulance staff had the lowest engagement scores in 2009/2010 whereas general managers had the highest engagement scores. Therefore, these effects may distort the overall engagement score for a Trust, and so may misguide further interpretation of what that score means. A weighting procedure is often used in these circumstances to (cid:513)correct(cid:514) for any distortions caused by other factors. The NHS staff survey applies a formula to each respondent(cid:514)s overall engagement score based on which staff group and type of Trust they belong to (e.g. nurse in an acute Trust, general management in an ambulance Trust etc). For each Trust, the (cid:513)weighted(cid:514) scores across the sample are then added together and divided by the number of respondents from the Trust to gain an overall engagement score for the entire Trust. This adjusted score represents the average level of engagement for the Trust, having accounted for the distribution of staff groups. This is then used to categorise and benchmark the Trust against other Trusts as well as itself in the past (see next section).

The results of the NHS staff survey for each Trust are made available via publicly released reports that summarise the key findings and benchmarking results for that Trust (see www.nhsstaffsurveys.com for access). The findings present the weighted average scores for the Trust rather than the distribution of scores. More information on the distribution of scores for each question in the NHS staff survey can be found on spreadsheets that detail the results of each question for every Trust in the NHS (cid:507)see the (cid:513)detailed spreadsheets(cid:514) section onwww.nhsstaffsurveys.com).
