# The integration imperative.

As some work units transition to a ﬂat model, they may need

to interface with units still operating under traditional hierarchies,

creating potential friction and misalignment. At Avinsa, this dynamic was evident when units with diﬀerent structures tried to collaborate.

While middle managers and senior leaders — who company leaders

believed were best positioned to adapt to decentralization with minimal

disruption to their day-to-day work — were incorporated into the

decentralization initiative, frontline workers, responsible for processing

100,000 chickens and 50 tons of ice per day, continued to work under

a hierarchical structure. This dual approach led to palpable disparities:

as some employees enjoyed newfound autonomy, frontline workers felt

left behind. Such inconsistencies can be taken personally, making it

crucial to navigate communication gaps without seeming contradictory.

Avinsa’s journey spotlights the importance of context and adaptability.

Although the company’s leaders aspire to design a completely ﬂat

organization, they are unsure when, if ever, they will extend the

decentralization initiative to the frontline workers. Similarly, not every

organization ﬁts neatly into theoretical molds, and decentralization

decisions must be tailored to speciﬁc challenges, personnel, and

organizational objectives. Company leaders can make progress in this

regard by slowly and organically incorporating more decentralized

principles into some parts of their organization without expecting these eﬀorts to look the same in other parts of their organization.

By pursuing deliberate and incremental change that gives employees

the time to make sense of and adjust to their new work environment,

company leaders can alleviate, though not entirely eliminate, feelings

of disorientation, threat, or anxiety that some employees may have. If executed eﬀectively, organizations can not only prevent potential
