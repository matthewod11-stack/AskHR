For example, Adam Smith believed there was a disproportionate aversion to losses which is a central

feature of Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory. Smith wrote (1759, III, ii, pp. 176-7):

Pain ... is, in almost all cases, a more pungent sensation than the opposite and correspondent pleasure.

The one almost always depresses us much more below the ordinary, or what may be called the natural state of

our happiness, than the other ever raises us above it.

Smith (1759, II, ii, ii, p. 121) also anticipates Thaler’s (1980) seminal2 analysis of the insensitivity to

opportunity costs, compared to out-of-pocket costs:

…breach of property, therefore, theft and robbery, which take from us what we are possessed of, are

greater crimes than breach of contract, which only disappoints us of what we expected.

Why did behavioral insights like these get left out of the neoclassical revolution? A possible answer,

suggested by Bruni and Sugden (2005), is that Vilfredo Pareto won an argument among economists in the early

1900’s about how deeply economic theories should be anchored in psychological reality. Pareto thought

ignoring psychology was not only acceptable, but was also necessary. In an 1897 letter he wrote:

It is an empirical fact that the natural sciences have progressed only when they have taken secondary

principles as their point of departure, instead of trying to discover the essence of things. ... Pure
