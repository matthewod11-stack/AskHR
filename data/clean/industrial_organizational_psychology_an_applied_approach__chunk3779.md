don’t know what you are supposed to do (not exceed  mph), the beneﬁ t of the increased viewing distances of the iconic signs may be nulliﬁ ed by the increased time to interpret them.

Th is use of icons will be eﬀ ective only if people have knowledge about the meaning of the icons. Let me provide you with a great example of this point. Our interstate highway system is actually very well designed and very well marked in most locations. However, many people can’t take full advantage of these well- designed and well-marked highways because they aren’t familiar with the codes appearing on the signs. For example, suppose you were driving on I- or I-. Th at both of these highways end in an odd number tells you that the highway runs north-south; even-numbered highways run east-west. Or suppose you were driving along, wanted to take the highway to Roanoke, and saw the sign in the accompanying photo. What does that sign tell you? Because the arrow is on the left side of the word “Roanoke,” you would need to get in the left lane and take a left turn onto the highway. If the arrow were on the right side or beneath the word “Roanoke,” you would get in the right lane and take a right turn onto the highway. How many people do you think know these rules?
