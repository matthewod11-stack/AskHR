## How Organizations Can Build Fairer Systems

Many organizations already have formal systems for reporting

misconduct, but these systems often fall short in practice. Recent

data suggests employees are more likely to report concerns to their

managers rather than hotlines. This means that informal processes

often determine which reports are acted on and which are quietly

dropped. Indeed, in many organizations, managers have wide discretion

over whether to escalate a report.

Even when employees use formal tools, like hotlines or online

platforms, organizations may apply them inconsistently or without suﬃcient follow-up. Improving these procedures isn’t just about adding

new tools, but rather it’s about redesigning the process to ensure

every report gets a fair evaluation. That is, to build fairer systems,

organizations should limit informal judgment and ensure all reports are

evaluated consistently.

Managers shouldn’t decide which reports to act on. All allegations of

abuse should be forwarded to a trained, centralized entity—regardless

of the manager’s personal judgment. For example, Novartis’ SpeakUp

platform is staﬀed by professionals who are trained to evaluate reports

of misconduct, including reports that initially lack strong corroboration.
