## HBR / Magazine Article / Your Company Needs an Eldercare Policy

Consider this remarkable fact: For the ﬁrst time in U.S. history, the

number of working adults providing care to an older adult (nearly 23

million) has surpassed the number providing care to preschool children

(21 million). Elder caregivers currently make up 14% of the workforce,

and that number is only going to increase, because Americans aged 65

and older are the fastest-growing segment of the population. By 2050

their numbers are projected to have increased by 30%, from 63 million

to 82 million, accounting for nearly one-quarter of the total population.

Growing even faster are the “oldest old” (aged 85+), whose numbers are

projected to increase nearly 150% during that period, from 7 million to

17 million. Similar trends prevail in nearly all developed countries and

many developing ones around the world.

Unfortunately, “health spans” (the time people can expect to live free of

disability) are not keeping pace with longer lifespans. Life expectancy

in the United States is around 78 years, but older adults on average now

spend the ﬁnal dozen years of their lives coping with poor health, a

number that has also grown in recent years. As we describe in our recent
