# Training

The 1970s and 1980s saw a proliferation of psychology and law training programs. The prototype was developed at the University of Nebraska by Bruce Sales in 1974, offering joint PhD and JD degrees in a blended graduate program involving the university’s psychology department and law school. Sev- eral other joint-degree programs followed, but even greater was the increase in clinical graduate programs that allowed students to specialize in forensic psychology either formally or informally. By 1980, about one-third of the clinical psychology graduate programs in the United States in- cluded courses in psychology and law or forensic psychology in their curricula (Grisso, Sales, & Bayless, 1982). Shortly thereafter, postdoctoral programs in psycholegal studies as well as forensic clinical psychology began to evolve.

Currently a number of doctoral programs offer training in “forensic psychology,” “psychology and law,” or “social sci- ence and law.” The latter two concentrations, which Brigham (1999) suggested could be called “legal psychology,” may be located within social psychology programs, stand alone as an area in psychology, or serve as a specialty within a general psychology and law track. In contrast, graduate training labeled as “forensic” typically is located within a clinical psychology program. A survey of graduate student members of the American Psychology-Law Society in the late 1990s found that almost half (48%) of those who replied were in clinical programs, while 18% were in social psychology pro- grams, 10% were in joint degree programs, and 8% were in applied graduate programs (Baldwin & Watts, 1996).
