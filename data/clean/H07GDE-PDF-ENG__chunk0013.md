Visualization exercises are key.

It’s diﬃcult to deliver a message online, where you don’t have a

physical audience to make an emotional connection with. To create that

emotional connection on Zoom, you’ll need to visualize the audience.

To do this, think about the following:

- Where is the audience watching from? Home? The oﬃce?

- Who’s with them? Their families? Colleagues?

- What will they feel as they hear the news?

- What are their immediate concerns?

- What will they ask that I can address right away?

- What fear can I alleviate?

You might take this a step further by creating “avatars” who represent

key employees, such as a 45-year-old father of three kids or a 63-year-

old woman nearing retirement. You can pretend you’re talking directly

to these speciﬁc employees, refer to their fears, and attempt to alleviate
