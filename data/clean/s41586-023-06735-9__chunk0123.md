in which Na and Nb denote the number of atoms in a structure and the number of samples in a batch, respectively, Eb̂ and Eb are the predicted and true energy for a given sample in a batch, respectively, and Fa,α is the true force component on atom a, for which α ∈ {x, y, z} is the spatial component. denotes a Huber loss on quantity a, ) δ a a , ( , for which we use δE = δF = 0.01. The pretrained potential has 16.24 million parameters. Inference on an A100 GPU on a 50-atom system takes approximately 14 ms, enabling a throughput of approximately 12 ns day−1 at a 2-fs time step, making inference times highly competi- tive with other implementations of GNN interatomic potentials. Exploring new approaches with even further improved computational efficiency is the focus of future work.
