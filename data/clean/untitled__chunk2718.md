## Ethnic Minorities in Research and Organization

do have an impact in academic and research circles, tend to focus their work on ethnic-minority issues.

Cuban-Americans often do not identify themselves with other Hispanics. The number of Cuban-Americans who are part of mainstream Hispanic groups such as La Raza are rather small. As G. C. Hall and Maramba (2001) have dis- covered, there is highly limited overlap between cross- cultural and ethnic-minority literature. They go on to report that authors of cross-cultural studies tend to be white men of European ancestry whereas ethnic-minority research tends to be authored by ethnic-minority men and women. Further, all ethnic-minorities with a Spanish surname in their review are of Latino and not of Cuban descent.

My service to the profession consisted of membership on a variety of boards and committees ranging from being pres- ident of the North Carolina Psychological Association, North Carolina Psychological Foundation, and the National Acad- emy of Neuropsychology (NAN) to serving on the Health Care Finance Administration’s Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee and the American Medical Association’s Current Procedural Terminology Panel. However, during the last 10 years, I have become much more interested in cultural, though not necessarily ethnic-minority issues. For example, I presented the ﬁrst workshop at a national neuropsychology convention on cultural issues in 1993.
