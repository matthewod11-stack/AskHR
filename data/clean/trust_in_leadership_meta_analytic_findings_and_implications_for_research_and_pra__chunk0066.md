## Exploration of Heterogeneity Due to Individual Studies

In addition to exploring whether heterogeneity can be accounted for by moderator variables, some researchers recommend explor- ing whether heterogeneity may be due to an effect size from an

individual study (or a small set of studies). Following the proce- dure described by Hedges (1987, p. 449), for each relationship with a significant homogeneity statistic, we withheld the effect size that yielded the largest reduction in the statistic. We repeated this procedure until either a maximum of 20% of studies were withheld or homogeneity was achieved. If homogeneity could be achieved by withholding 20% or fewer effect sizes, it is possible that the observed heterogeneity was attributable to a few anomalous val- ues. For the primary meta-analysis, this procedure found that homogeneity could be achieved for OCB sportsmanship and dis- tributive justice. Analysis also indicated that homogeneity could be achieved in some subcategories: job satisfaction (cognitive trust), civic virtue (overall trust), organizational commitment (trust in direct leader), altruism (trust in direct leader), and turnover inten- tions (trust in organizational leadership).
