# EVALUATION

During this stage you will evaluate performance of your prompt relative to the success criteria that you’ve selected. Time spent here will be rewarded with a higher-performing production system, so don’t rush through it.

Evaluation is the key to iteration. Without strong evaluation tests, you will have no way to know whether or not the changes you make are having a positive or negative impact, and you will lack infrastructure to confidently assess and adapt to future model upgrades.
