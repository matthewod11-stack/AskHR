# Decentralized pattern

In a decentralized pattern, agents can ‘hando(cid:31)’ work$ow execution to one another. Hando(cid:31)s are a one way transfer that allow an agent to delegate to another agent. In the Agents SDK, a hando(cid:31) is a type of tool, or function. If an agent calls a hando(cid:31) function, we immediately start execution on that new agent that was handed o(cid:31) to while also transferring the latest conversation state.4

This pattern involves using many agents on equal footing, where one agent can directly hand3 o(cid:31) control of the work$ow to another agent. This is optimal when you don’t need a single agent maintaining central control or synthesis—instead allowing each agent to take over execution and interact with the user as needed.
