## HBR / Digital Article / Should You Record That Meeting?

long-standing question: Is the cost and impact of recording (and then

transcribing) an interview worth it, or will my notes do the trick?

Ask yourself how often you go back to and use the transcripts you

generated. How does that stack up against the points above? Here it’s

also important to recognize that the act of taking notes increases our

own engagement and keeps us focused.

This doesn’t mean you should never capture meetings without a

detailed use plan—sometimes “just in case” is a good-enough reason.

But the key here is to make a conscious decision and ask yourself how

bad would it be if you didn’t have a recording.
