## respondents to the AMA/Institute for Corporate Productivity Coaching Survey 2008

reported that they currently have coaching programs in place in their organizations.

What’s more, of the 48% that don’t offer coaching at this time, 37% plan to

implement a coaching program in the future. There doesn’t appear to be a universal

methodology for evaluating coaching benefits (Leedham, 2005). Of the existing

coaching evaluation methods, some are based purely on the perception of the

recipient, which can be an unreliable gauge.

An assessment on previous studies in the field of training are limited to formal

educational courses and instructor led training methods. Local Studies include;

Onyango (2012) who conducted a study on The Influence of training and

development on employee’s performance and found out training and development

has a positive impact on employee performance in terms of productivity. Another

(cid:55)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

study by Cephas (2013) on the training interventions on performance found that

there is a direct correlation between training and performance. Ngugi (2014) carried

a study on the perceived relationship between training and development and

employee performance and found out that training and development has an

influence on the employee performance. Training and development helps

employees work together as teams, ensure harmony and consistency across the

teams and this helps improve performance (Musili 2010).

This research therefore seeks to address some of the knowledge gaps in the

development of the coaching discipline in Kenyan organizations. It mainly focuses

on coaching practices in organizations with the hope that it will address the question,

is there a relationship between coaching and employee performance?
