# cost per applicant)

As an example, suppose we hire ten auditors per year, the average person in this position stays  years, the validity coefficient is ., and average annual salary for the position is $,, and we have  applicants for  openings. Thus,

n =  t =  r = . SDy = $, × . = $, m = / = . = . (. is converted to . by using Table .) cost of testing = ( applicants × $)

Using the above formula, we would have

() () (.) (,) (.) − () () = $,
