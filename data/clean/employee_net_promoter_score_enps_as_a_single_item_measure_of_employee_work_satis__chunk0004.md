# Introduction

Living in the modern world means a high probability of being invited to a survey and facing the question: “How likely is it that you would recommend X company to a friend or colleague?”. Those respondents taking part in an employee satisfac- tion survey may have heard the version “[…] would you recommend work at our company to a friend or colleague […]”. This single question concerning the will- ingness to recommend is a base for the Net Promoter Score1 indicator. It became so popular in customer surveys that it could claim the title of The Holy Grail of so- cial research. Does it deserve it?

This text will focus on NPS methodology and its possibility to be adapted in an employee satisfaction survey. An important task is checking what the “would recommend” question really measures. A fair part will be devoted to deliberation about the development of the NPS and showing how the “would recommend” ques- tion works in practice of the employee satisfaction surveys.
