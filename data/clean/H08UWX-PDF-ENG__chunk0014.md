The importance of probing a candidate’s skills early in the process is

made stark by the extent of interviewing actually undertaken. In our

sample, the average number of interviews per candidate was 2.97, with

a standard deviation of 1.50 interviews. Candidates have a very limited

opportunity to present their credentials, so their odds of advancing

in a recruiting process are likely to hinge on the eﬀectiveness of

their interviewers. Those who cover more important topics thoroughly

probably enhance interviewees’ chances of advancing; those who

meander or cover redundant topics probably undermine them.
