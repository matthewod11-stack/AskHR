mentorship can also lead to opportunities for a more traditionalmentoring relationship. By being open to mentoring seniorleaders, you’ll have the opportunity to build connections andlearn about company politics, career options, leadership, strategicthinking, and more.So how can you get started as a reverse mentor?
