Likewise, Aisha, a deaf customer service worker who works in Texas, remembers that she was denied the services of an ASL interpreter even during the training. She said she could read slides or lip-read. That is not equal access. I was always excluded from conversations. I made a complaint, but it did not go anywhere." Such narratives highlight the structural disabilities to access rights experienced by individuals, especially those residing in states with low enforceability of the ADA. 6.2 Perspectives from Employers and HR Professionals The role of HR and the employers is also important in influencing the ADA experiences. Several attitudes and readiness are observed in interviewing HR professionals. Jessica, a California- based HR director at one of the California-based tech enterprises, pointed out the necessity to have ADA compliance a part of the working culture. "We train all managers annually, consult with accessibility experts, and in our physical and digital environments," she said. On one hand, a small business owner, Dan in Mississippi, confessed to being confused. "I’m not against hiring disabled workers, but I don’t understand the law well. I fear making a mistake and being sued. We can’t afford legal guidance like big companies." The ADA is usually conscientiously adopted depending on the size and the resources of the employer. Large organizations are more likely to have a legal department or consultant, whereas informal traditions and the lack of awareness or incentives to invest in accessibility are characteristic of smaller businesses. Certain HR managers commented that coming to terms with accommodation and product requirements is very difficult and particularly in physically taxing professions.

These insights indicate how policy envelopes intertwine with workplace culture, administrative resources, as well as business models to determine the nature of compliance. 6.3 Analysis of EEOC Mediation and Litigation Outcomes EEOC has a pivotal role in solving ADA-related disputes. Comparison of the results of a mediation litigation review provides essential information about the availability and functionality of enforcement. The idea of mediation is to be a quicker process that is less litigious than litigation. Although its performance tends to be good in high-compliance states, things are not the same in other states. According to the EEOC in the year 2023, 67 percent of mediations that arose because of the ADA were successfully resolved. But the resolution was lowest in the Southern and Midwestern states (Chen, 2023). Most complainants in these areas complain of procedural delays and lack of follow-up, or the inability to attend face-to-face mediation sessions, particularly in rural settings. As an example, a
