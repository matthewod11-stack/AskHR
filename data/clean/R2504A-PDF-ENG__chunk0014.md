This staged approach not only makes the work more manageable for our

teams, it also helps us to avoid overwhelming our customers. Adoption

rates for simple oﬀerings are much better than for complex ones. We

also learn how people use the ﬁrst feature, which informs and improves

the rollout of the rest. Within a year, we have the originally envisioned

product, but it’s been co-created with the customer.
