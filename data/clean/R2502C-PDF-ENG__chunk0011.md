Third, these strategies assume that practices are interchangeable. When

along with powerful incentives to achieve them—the heads of the

operating units often look to the “best practices” of other companies

succeed despite certain practices rather than because of them, and

transplanting practices from one complex system to another rarely

yields the same results. Various parts of a company may adopt diverse

management practices that serve their own purposes even when they

a collection of loosely aﬃliated businesses—and its shares to trade at

conglomerate discounts. That leads to communication breakdowns, lost

synergies, and increased overhead costs associated with the additional

supervision and conﬂict resolution required to compensate for the lack
