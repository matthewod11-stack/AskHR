# Measures

Pay inequity: aligned with Gerhart (1990), we examined the magnitude of differences in current salaries of employees (mean 3140 euro/month; SD 1141) controlling for both key supply- and demand-side factors. On the supply side, standard measures of the amount of human capital were used (i.e., job tenure, supervisory position, type of contract, and educational degree). On the demand side, job content was controlled through the use of job titles and supervisory performance appraisals. These factors are known to influence pay in the universities based on the old pay system (i.e., geographical location, tenure, supervisory position, job contract) and should have impact in the new pay policy (i.e., education, performance, job).

More specifically, as two universities in different geographical locations were studied, a dummy variable was used to control for organization (n1=247; n2=208). Work tenure measured in years employed by the current university (mean 12, 71 years; SD 9, 59) was included. Two dummy variables were used to control for type of job contract (temporary n1=221; permanent n2=234). A dummy variable was included to control for supervisory position (no n1=368; yes n2=87). Performance appraisal was measured by including the most recent supervisory overall performance rating (mean 6, 20; SD 1, 38; min1 max 11, 5). Four dummy variables were used for highest education degree (comprehensive or upper secondary school n1=45, higher vocational diploma or college level training n2=51, higher education n3=201, licentiate or doctor’s degree n4=198). Finally, eight dummy variables corresponding to job content were included [Professor n1=58, Lecturer n2=69, Assistant Professor n3=47, Researcher n4=162, Teaching or Research Assistant n5=22, Secretary n6=39, Specialized administrative personnel (i.e., laboratory managers) n7=65, Other computer administrative personnel n8=33]. All of these variables statistically significantly predicted the employee pay level (see Table 1 in Appendix). We used the residual of this function to study individual responses to pay inequity. A negative value indicates that the person is receiving less than typical in these universities taking into account the above mentioned demand and supply factors. A positive value indicates that the person is getting paid more than they merit (based on individual negotiations, some other informal procedures or exceptions to the main policy).
