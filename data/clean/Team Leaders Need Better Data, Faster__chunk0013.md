# team leader.

Your team leader is the one who makes the diﬀerence. If your

organization wants high performance and engagement—or, for that matter, collaboration, innovation, quality, eﬃciency, and agility—then

these things are created in the context of a team and a team leader, or

they are not created at all. This variation in team-level data reminds us

that the most important decision an organization makes on any subject

is not strategy, marketing messaging, or capital allocation. It is who you

make team leader. As goes the team leader, so goes everything.

Intuitively, we all know this. Many of us have worked for a great

company with a rotten boss, and, sadly, seen the rotten boss trump

the great company. So you might have thought that our people systems

—those tools and processes that address performance and engagement

inside an organization—would all focus on serving the team leader. And

yet they don’t. Look closely and you realize that our entire suite of

people systems misses its most important audience.

Take employee engagement as an example. Engagement happens, or

fails to happen, in the context of a team. The company can provide

the support and the tools, but the actual experience of working in a

company is in the hands and mind of each team leader. It is surprising

then to see most employee engagement programs deliver survey data

in the following sequence: ﬁrst the data go to HR, where they are

poured over, vetted, and cleaned; then they are presented to senior

management where patterns are explained and improvements over the

previous year celebrated; and then ﬁnally, oftentimes months after

the data were collected, they are cascaded down to team leaders …

where, inevitably and justiﬁably, the data are dismissed as too stale,
