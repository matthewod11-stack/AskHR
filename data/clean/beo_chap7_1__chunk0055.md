# CHAPTER SEVEN

means inferring more than is justified about the unobserved effort e; from output

FS (ez, 51) + % or, alternatively, underestimating the importance of luck (var(6;)). In

the context of the firm, attribution is likely to be especially important in evaluating

top executives, who make far-reaching decisions with noisy and lagged feedback.

They are likely to be both credited and blamed too much for forces beyond their

control. Applied to a person’s own judgement of his or her efforts, however, attri-

butions tend to be self-serving. For example, Bettman and Weitz (1983) find that,

when companies do well, corporate annual reports attribute the success to internal

factors and skill. When companies do badly, the reports attribute blame to external

factors (regulation, demand shocks, and so forth). Those findings lack, of course,

the ultimate proof of distortion. Moreover, even evidently distorted information pro-

vision may simply be the rational response to investors’ lack of information or to

investor credulity. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) show that exogenous variation

in profits is reflected in executives’ compensation. They find that compensation of oil

company executives rises with worldwide oil prices, even though oil prices are set

by global demand and OPEC output and are not influenced much by one executive’s

action. At the same time, executives are largely shielded from blame (in the form

of lower compensation) when oil prices fall. Indeed, the phenomenon of “negative

shielding”——~relative insensitivity of compensation to poor performance, compared

to stronger sensitivity to good performance—is widely documented in executive

compensation (Garvey and Milbourn, forthcoming). It remains unclear from these

studies which agents—if any—are misattributing positive outcomes. One possibil-

ity is that boards mistakenly give credit for positive outcomes and CEOs rationally

exploit or even induce the misattribution of board members. Alternatively, execu-

tives themselves attribute positive outcomes to their own skills or effort and bad

outcomes to bad luck. If corporate governance is weak, such CEOs may then extract
