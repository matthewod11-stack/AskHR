## CFR 60-741.5 in each of their nonexempt contracts and subcontracts.

Under the regulations implementing Section 503, certain contractors and subcontractors are required to have

a written program for employing and advancing in employment individuals with disabilities. Speciﬁcally, each

contractor or subcontractor that (1) has a Federal contract or subcontract of $50,000 or more and (2) 50 or

more employees must prepare, implement, and maintain a written program for each of its establishments. The

contractor must review and update the program annually and must make it available for inspection to any employee or applicant for employment, as well as to OFCCP.

Employees of and applicants for employment with a covered Federal contractor or subcontractor have the

right to ﬁle a complaint with OFCCP if they believe that a Federal contractor or subcontractor has

discriminated against them on the basis of a disability. Anyone may call OFCCP with a question about

interpreting the regulations, ﬁling a complaint, or any other related matter. Additional telephone numbers are located on OFCCP's Oﬃce Contact webpage.
