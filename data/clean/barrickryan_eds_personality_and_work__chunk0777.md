## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 263

tensive, PG ﬁt is discussed in Chapter Seven in this volume, and the role of personality in PO ﬁt assessment is less understood.

Our goal in this chapter is not to review the literature on PO ﬁt. Indeed, several comprehensive reviews already exist (Judge & Kristof-Brown, in press; Kristof, 1996; Werbel & Gilliland, 1999). Considerable research has demonstrated that perceptions of PO ﬁt relate to important individual and organizational outcomes (for example, satisfaction, organizational commitment, extra-role be- haviors, organizational attraction, hiring decisions, turnover; Cable & Judge, 1997; Judge & Cable, 1997; Lauver & Kristof-Brown, 2002; Kristof-Brown, 2000; Verquer, Beehr, & Wagner, 2001). Instead, we discuss four pertinent issues regarding the role of personality in PO ﬁt.

- Does PO ﬁt on personality even matter? • When is good PO ﬁt on personality bad, and when is bad PO ﬁt on personality good for individuals and organizations?

- How accurate are personality PO ﬁt perceptions? • How does ﬁt relate to adaptability?
