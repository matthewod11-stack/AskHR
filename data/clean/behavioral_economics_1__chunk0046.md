Game theory: Game theory is a taxonomy of canonical strategic interactions and a collection

mathematical theories of how players with varying degrees of rationality are likely to play in games as they are

perceived. Since many of the games are complicated, and equilibrium theories often assume a high degree of

mutual rationality and complicated Bayesian inference, game theory is ripe for introduction of behavioral

alternatives that weaken equilibrium assumptions in a disciplined way. Many theoretical papers have explored

the implications of weakened assumptions of rationality. Many predictions of game theory depend delicately on

what players commonly know and on assumptions about the utility derived from outcomes. As a result,

experiment which carefully control strategies, information, and payoffs have been unusually helpful in

clarifying conditions under which equilibrium predictions are likely to hold or not (Crawford, 1997; Camerer,

2003).

Two central contributions of behavioral game theory are worth mentioning. One is the study of limits on

strategic thinking. One type of theory studies how finite automata that implement strategies with limited

calculation and memory will behave (e.g., Rubinstein, 1998). Empirically-driven theories posit some

distribution of steps of thinking (the cognitive hierarchy theories discussed in section III). The other important

contribution is precise theories of how monetary payoffs to one player and others map onto the focal player’s

utility (also discussed in section III).

Behavioral game theory has largely been shaped by experimental observation of educated people

playing games in experiments for money. Here, equilibrium predictions do not always fare well compared to

learning theories, and to QRE and cognitive hierarchy approaches. But equilibrium theory might apply at other

levels of analysis, especially low and high levels, such as animal behavior sculpted by evolution (e.g., optimal

foraging), and decisions of firms and nation-states which are widely-deliberated and analyzed carefully.

Labor and organizational economics: Labor economics is certainly ripe for behavioral analysis (see

Camerer and Malmendier, in press). Most workers do not have much chance to learn from experience before

making important decisions with irreversibility— choosing education, and a first job that often determines a

career track. The goods that workers sell—their time—is also likely to involve more social comparison,

optimism, emotion and identity than when firms sell cars or iPods. In many cases, workers appear to care about

a range of nonpecuniary incentives besides money, such as fair treatment and being appreciated.

Inside the firm, evaluation of worker performance is imperfect in all but the simplest organizations in

which piece rates can be tied to individual productivity (like fruit-picking and car repair); imperfect evaluation

leads to scope for biases in judgment. For example, hindsight bias—the tendency to think, ex post, that

outcomes were more ex-ante predictable than they actually were—creates second-guessing and complicates
