## implementation of the idealized contracts in agency theory.

Many experiments have studied reciprocity (or gift-exchange) in simple versions of labor markets. In the

simplest case, firms prepay a wage and workers then choose effort which is costly for them but valuable for

firms. If there is an excess supply of workers and no scope for reputation-building15, self-interested workers

should be happy to get jobs but should also shirk; firms should anticipate this and offer a minimum wage.

Empirically, however, when effort is very valuable to firms and not too costly to workers, firms pay wages far

above the minimum, and workers reciprocate by exerting more effort when they were paid a higher wage. When

workers are identified to firms, and firms can repeatedly hire good workers, Brown, Falk and Fehr (2004) show

how a “two-tier” insider-outsider economy can emerge experimentally.

15 Healy (2004) shows that the amount of reciprocity by workers is sensitive to the shared gains from effort. Charness, Frechette and Kagel (2004) show that framing of the instructions can lower reciprocity. Healy also shows in a simple model how a perception of correlation of reciprocal worker types can induce gift exchange even when the wage-effort game is repeated only finitely. His important insight is that type correlation induces “group reputation”.

Data like these are a reminder that intrinsic motivations like reciprocity matter and can be quite strong.

Furthermore, adding extrinsic incentives can be harmful if they “crowd out” intrinsic incentives (a phenomenon

long-studied in psychology), so that standard models get the sign wrong in predicting effects of extrinsic

incentive changes. Benabou and Tirole (2003) approach crowding out in a different way. They show that

higher incentives can induce lower effort because high wages signal that a job is very hard, or a worker is
