# “survivor syndrome.”

And you’re not alone. Business news and social media are bursting with

announcements about layoﬀs around the globe. In 2024, the technology

sector alone laid oﬀ nearly 130,000 employees. Consider Intel, which

took the market by surprise in late summer by announcing a 15% global

workforce reduction, or Cisco, which laid oﬀ about 9,600 employees last

year. While tech has been severely hit, other industries, from industrials

to retail, also saw sweeping job cuts. For example, Boeing recently

announced it will cut 17,000 jobs, and German rail incumbent Deutsche

Bahn reported it will trim 9% of its workforce over the next ﬁve years.

In the consumer sector, Unilever shared plans to reduce a third of all European oﬃce roles by the end of this year.

Companies often overlook the negative impacts of change on those

who remain after a layoﬀ. These employees’ emotional, behavioral, and

psychological reactions have been characterized as “workplace survivor

syndrome,” a term that borrows its name from psychological studies

linked to surviving a disastrous or highly traumatic experience. When

your colleagues are laid oﬀ, the emotional and psychological toll of the

layoﬀs doesn’t end with their departure; it lingers, and it can alter how

you perceive yourself, your role, and your performance. You’re left to

navigate a mineﬁeld of emotions, uncertainties, and new expectations,

often without a clear roadmap for how to proceed.

If you’re a layoﬀ survivor, how can you regain a sense of control over

your work life? Once you have a solid understanding of the challenges

you’re facing, you can take steps to navigate your new work situation

with clarity and conﬁdence. Here are some speciﬁc challenges you

might experience:
