## First described by Harvard Business School’s Chris Argyris, a

psychological contract describes the implicit understanding that

employees have about what they owe the company and what the

company owes them. Psychological contracts are, as Carnegie Mellon’s

Denise Rousseau has observed, based on trust, “which develops from a

belief that contributions will be reciprocated and that a relationship

exists where actions of one party are bound to those of another.”

Importantly, she notes: “A damaged relationship is not easily restored.”

Post-Covid RTO policies provide a powerful example of broken

psychological contracts. Employees who felt they had demonstrated

that they could work productively from home and who had rearranged

their lives in ways that they did not believe would be temporary felt

betrayed by their companies when the terms were changed, regardless

of the rationale. Let’s go back to Amazon. To explain the changes, Jassy

wrote to employees: “We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates

to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture [when people are

in the oﬃce together]; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more eﬀective.”

We agree with those arguments, having written about them in

HBR in 2021. But if the real underlying issues are trust and the

relationship between employers and employees, then arguments about strengthening culture and making brainstorming more eﬀective are

beside the point and won’t persuade their intended audience that the

policy is correct and fair. Instead, perhaps at play here is a disagreement

about what each side in the psychological contract owes to the other

regarding the terms and conditions of employment.

Today, many employers understand “fairness” as an abstract principle,

applying the ethics of justice lens, which assumes that it is possible
