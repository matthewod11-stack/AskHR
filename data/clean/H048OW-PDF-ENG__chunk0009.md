# home countries of their ancestors.

The CEOs in our sample led 441 publicly-listed U.S. banks between 1994

and 2006. Among them, 293 were either children or grandchildren of

immigrants, and we called them our second- and third-generation CEOs.

We hand-collected data on the country of origin of a CEO’s ancestors from

ancestry.com, the world’s largest genealogy database, which covers nearly

20 billion family histories. We traced a CEO’s ancestors by searching his or

her name, birthplace, and birth year to identify parents, then used the

same technique to identify the grandparents, and so on. Looking at a range

of data sources — from census records to marriage certiﬁcates to

passenger lists on immigration ships that sailed from Europe to the U.S. —

we were able to map their family trees. We were able to accurately

determine the ancestors going back six generations for these 610 U.S.

bank CEOs. We identiﬁed the country that his or her ancestors immigrated

from, and how many generations ago the ancestors moved to the U.S. For
