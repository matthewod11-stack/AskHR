2.2 Developing a talent pool

We utilise the term talent pool to refer to the pool of high potential and high

performing incumbents that the organisation can draw upon to fill pivotal talent positions.

While differing with Boudreau and Ramstad’s (2005; 2007) use of the term pivotal talent

pools, to refer to the key roles within organisations which differentiate performance, our

definition is consistent with authors such as Smilansky (2006), Sparrow, (2007) and Stahl

et al (2007). Our framework proposes that having identified the pivotal talent positions

within an organisation, the key for strategic talent management system is the

development of a talent pool to fill these pivotal positions.

In simple terms, this entails a shift from vacancy led recruitment toward ‘recruiting

ahead of the curve’ (Sparrow, 2007). This clearly resonates with earlier contributions in

the secession planning tradition. It involves the proactive identification of incumbents

with the potential to fill key positions which may become available. Smilansky (2006)

likens this to talent scouting in the world of professional sports. Organizations such as

Zurich systematically identify future business needs in terms of knowledge, skills and

capabilities that will be required in the future but are not currently available in house and

recruit on this basis. Indeed, Stahl et al’s (2007) study of global talent management

confirmed that the high performing organisations they studied followed a talent pool

strategy- recruiting the best people and then finding positions for them.

However, it is important to introduce a note of caution here. Those employees who

are likely to compose this talent pool are high achievers and may easily become

disillusioned if they are appointed to roles with limited scope for the application of their

skills or development of their talent. In this regard, Hackman et al’s (1975) research

demonstrates that where jobs are more complex employees tend to be more motivated,

more satisfied and even more productive. Given that those included in the organization’s

talent pool will be high achievers to begin with, the impact of working in menial roles are

likely to be magnified and likely to result in a reduction in employee’s perceived person

organization which we return to below.

In engaging with this challenge, Cappelli (2008b: 77) draws insights from the

supply chain management and argues: “how employees advance through development

jobs and experiences- are remarkably similar to how products move through a supply

chain”. A key failure of many traditional talent management systems is a mismatch

between supply and demand. This results in an over-supply of management talent

resulting in employee turnover, or layoffs and restructuring, or an under-supply where

key positions cannot be filled (Cappelli, 2008a). This issue is exasperated by the
