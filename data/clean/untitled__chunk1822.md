# 318 Abnormal Psychology

Neuroscience research overturned view that the cerebral hemispheres are identical in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Results of neurological research, including autopsies performed on patients with psychological deÔ¨Åcits related to brain tumors and traumas, correlation of behavioral changes with ablation of particular structures of the central nervous system, direct electrical stimulation of areas of the exposed brain in living subjects and the corresponding techniques of measuring degree and locus of electrical activity of the brain evoked by systematic stimulation of areas of the body, all lent support for the theory that different psychological functions are localized in separate areas of the brain.
