## support for a performance management system.

In Chapters 1 and 2 we discussed the fact that good performance management systems encourage employees to make tangible and important contributions toward the organization’s strategic objectives. When these contributions to the top organiza- tional and unit priorities are made clear, performance management systems are likely to receive crucial top management support. Without this support, it is unlikely that a performance management system will be successful. How, then, are these strategic organizational objectives identified? How does an organization know what the “target” should be, what it is trying to accomplish, and how to do it? These questions are answered by considering an organization’s strategic plan.
