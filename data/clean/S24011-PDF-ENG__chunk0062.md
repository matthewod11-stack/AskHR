## Wisdom Energy: Calm and Receptive to the Truth

- 5. Understand before you act. Approach an issue with heightened

curiosity, and fully explore it before making your move.

- 6. Disarm. When you encounter disagreement, find something true in what

the other party is saying and affirm it.

- 7. Fuse opposing viewpoints. Find a way to integrate contradictory

positions into a more nuanced and balanced perspective. For instance,

if team members disagree about the quality of their presentation, their

manager might point out that while the presentation was analytically

persuasive, it overlooked building an emotional connection.
