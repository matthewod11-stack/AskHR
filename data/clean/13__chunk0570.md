# (a) The biosocial perspective.

Some theorists have argued that many emotional reactions to stimuli (e.g., stigmatized individuals) are largely automatic or innate (Zajonc, 1980). As such, they require little or no cognitive mediation and are highly resistant to change. In support of the automatic perspective, experimental research by Vanman, Paul, Ito, and Miller (1997) showed that target race elicited emotional reactions that were not seemingly mediated by cognitions. In fact, whereas measures based on cognitions (e.g., self-reports of affect) showed that observers had more positive affective reactions to black as opposed to white targets, EMG-based measures showed the reverse pattern.
