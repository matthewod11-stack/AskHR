## HBR / Spotlight Article / Leaders Must React

Cultural crises also often begin with whisper warnings. Many leaders

ousted for #MeToo misbehavior had been subject to quiet allegations

for years. At Uber signs of an arrogant, we’re-above-the-rules attitude

and a toxic culture were evident before Susan Fowler, an Uber engineer

who’d quit, wrote a 2017 blog post putting them in the public eye. She

recounted being sexually harassed by her supervisor and experiencing

an egregious lack of support when she reported his behavior to HR. The

ensuring uproar led to the ouster of Uber’s cofounder and CEO, and it

took the company years to rebuild its culture and reputation.

Leaders need to pay careful attention to small signs of discontent or

distress that have the potential to fester and grow, especially among

members of the board or the senior team or employees at large. When

they crop up, the best approach is to act quickly and nip problems in

the bud. With most whisper warnings, you can take steps to mitigate

the situation before it explodes into a crisis. Whether by announcing

a voluntary product recall, pulling the proverbial Andon cord on a

quality or safety issue, ﬁring a toxic executive, or reaching out to talk

to someone who is upset, leaders who respond early are more eﬀective

at tamping down simmering issues. Developing contingency plans to

address potential escalation can also be helpful, as initial preemptive

actions don’t always work.

While every whisper warning doesn’t warrant a CEO’s undivided

attention, discerning which minor issues could become much more

troublesome is a form of judgment that deﬁnes eﬀective leaders.

The leader’s task: Don’t overreact. Watch and wait.

In The Odyssey, alluring sirens sing to passing sailors, tempting them

onto the shoals and into shipwrecks. Today many things likewise draw
