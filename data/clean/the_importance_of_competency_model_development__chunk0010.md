Consequently, there are several competency definitions that are similar to each other although each organisation may have a different competency concept. To summarise, it can be said that the core competency components include knowledge, skills and abilities or attitudes.

1.2 Competency Model Concept In the first development phase of the competency-based theory which lasted from the 1960s to the 1990s, the study and evaluation of competencies were focused on the observation a skill developed by self- of individual competencies. Competency was defined as organisation and required to perform the person’s work. In the second phase, in the 1990s, personnel management was focused on the creation of competency models and their management in organisations. The third phase in personnel management, which continues today, is the typical identification of the core competencies required to gain a competitive advantage (Skorková, 2016).

The EU Council Recommendation for each person’s core competencies includes:

Literacy competency; ● ● Multilingual competency; ● Mathematical competency and competency in science, technology

and engineering; ● Digital competency; ● ● ● ●

Personal, social and learning to learn competency; Citizenship competency; Entrepreneurial competency; Cultural awareness and expression competency (CEU, 2018).

Everyone needs the key competencies referred to in the Council Recommendation in order to improve performance, meet modern living standards, adapt to market changes and be competitive in the labour market. Identification of competencies in society led to the so-called competency model, which is characteristic of a particular position. The group of key competencies forms a competency model. Therefore, the competency model describes a combination of specific knowledge, skills and other personal qualities required to effectively perform duties in an organisation. The model structure should support the use of competencies across the selected human resource functions. The competency model should give a clear definition of each competency, including measurable or observable performance indicators or by the individuals who are the evaluators (Skorková, 2016).

standards. These will be used

There are two main competency model research directions. First, job-specific models are focused on the development of specific skills in specific workplaces. Examples of specific competencies include product knowledge, th e administrative and technical fields of private company managers, and the training and qualification building skills for the training of specialists. Regardless of the specific competencies’ characteristic for the jobs, there are some common core competencies such as entrepreneurial competencies (for instance, strategic management, innovation and change), self- expression and interpersonal competencies as well as leadership competencies (Shum, Gatling and Shoemaker, 2018). Sisson and Adams (2013) have proved that general

competencies account for 86% of all competencies. This is why the second competency research direction is focused on the development of general competency models. General models pay more attention to business, personal and management competencies and place less emphasis on technical skills.

- 2. Advantages of Competency Model Elaboration and Competency Development

A knowledge-based economy, fact memorisation and procedural knowledge are important but not sufficient factors for business success and progress. Such skills as problem- solving, critical thinking, the ability to cooperate, creativity, and self-regulation are much more relevant in today’s fast-paced society than ever. These are the tools that provide the opportunity to work in real time, create new ideas, new theories, new prod ucts and new knowledge (CEU, 2018). Human competencies affec t their behaviour, ‘we do what we can’ (Loots, Cnossen and Witteloostuijn, 2018). In addition, it has been proven that persons believing that they are good at doing some kind of task and derive pleasure from it, have a greater chance to persist in doing the task and improve their abilities even more. The person’s perception that he or she is competent activates the said person’s behaviour and ensures greater development in the particular field (Deci and Ryan, 2000). The development of employee skills is essential for the continuous improvement and adaptation of the workforce competencies.

Development of competency models has substantial advantages in different fields (see Figure 2). The author compared the academic field with the private business and public sectors because the goal of the academic field is to ensure competencies that will be useful for two other sectors and the main advantages vary depending on sector aims. Competency models are useful tools for teachers to identify and develop the knowledge, skills and abilities required for future leaders (Sisson and Adams, 2013; Shum, Gatling and Shoemaker, 2018). High-quality education, training and lifelong learning provide everyone with the opportunity to develop core competencies. Therefore, a competency-based approach can be used in all education, training and learning programmes regardless of the education level and age (The Council of the European Union, 2018). According to the findings of Chih et al. (2003), the analysis of content for competency in education and training is the essential factor in order to increase training effectiveness. It also includes the development of standards related to the identification of the competencies required.

Likewise, the development of competency models in companies allows identifying the required skills that would contribute to the development of the organisation. Competency- based management, in which competency models are the main tool in human resource systems and practices, is currently topical. Competency-based selection is effective in the rapidly changing business environment in which companies recognise the value of interpersonal relationships, effective communication, teamwork, willingness to support these changes, and the ability to learn quickly (Skorková, 2016). There is a considerable range of studies proving the relation between different competencies and a company’s competitive advantages performance and between different competencies and (Fernandez et al., 2018). However, most of the evidence from these studies relates to medium and large sized companies and industrial plants (Miller, Dröge and Vickery, 1997; Fernandez et al., 2018). Small companies should con stantly strive for a sustainable competitive advantage over their competitors. Competency models can be used in many

human resources development areas, i.e. recruitment of officials, remuneration process, training, job performance management and the elaboration of a development programme. It is the main tool for employee assessment, career planning and talent management. It should be mentioned that the final list of competencies included in the competency model is sometimes a big surprise to the company who requested the model. It can reveal the difference between what is officially expected by the company (declaring it in its internal policy) and what is actually required from its employees (Skorková, 2016).

A person’s individual competency is something typical of a person that can be used to predict the level of performance. It has been established that there is a correlation between the employees’ competencies and their productivity (Buchel, 2002). Each individual’ s competency should be able to support the organisation’s strategy and any changes made by management (Muizu and Yudomartono, 2016). A full assessment of the person is used in the competency-based selection process. The main task is to determine the person’s potential and how this person can contribute to the survival of the organisation, quality of services, productivity, financial indicators and sustainable development (Bharwani and Jauhari, 2013; Blayney, 2009). Competency-based hum an resources management is regarded to be an effective means of people management in the private and public sectors (Skorková, 2016). Another advantage of competency development is that it is positively associated both with business performance and with the employees’ professional beliefs and job satisfaction (Blayney, 2009; Ko, 2012).
