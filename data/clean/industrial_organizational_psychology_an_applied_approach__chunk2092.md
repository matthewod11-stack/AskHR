# Reward Versus Punishment

Rather than rewarding desired behaviors, we can change employee performance by punishing undesired behaviors. That is, instead of rewarding employees who do not miss work, we punish those who do. Instead of providing monetary incen- tives for high levels of performance, we suspend employees for low levels of per- formance. Though many psychologists advise against punishment, it is common, and managers generally believe it to be effective (Butterfield, Trevino, & Ball, ).

Proponents of using punishment to change employee behavior argue that if applied properly, punishment not only reduces undesired behaviors in a par- ticular employee but also sets an example for other employees. Opponents of punishment argue that punishment changes behavior only in the short run, does not teach an employee proper behaviors, and causes resentment. Furthermore, punishment causes employees to learn new methods to break rules, rather than

teaching them not to break rules. A meta-analysis comparing the reward and punishment behaviors of leaders found that although both reward and punish- ment behaviors affect employee behavior and attitudes, the magnitude of the effect is stronger for rewards (Podsakoff, Bommer, Podsakoff, & MacKenzie, ).

For punishment to be effective, an employee must understand why he is being punished and be shown alternative ways of behaving that will result in some type of desired reinforcement. The punishment must also “fit the crime” in that too severe a punishment will cause resentment and too lenient a punishment will not motivate a change in behavior. As one would imagine, punishment should usually be done in private rather than in front of other employees.
