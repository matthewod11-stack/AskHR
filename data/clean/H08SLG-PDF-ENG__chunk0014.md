## Our research points to three behaviors of leaders and managers who

enable their teams in this way:

Focus on ideas instead of tasks. One of us (Megan) was working

with a CEO who wanted his senior team to focus more on the bigger

picture rather than day-to-day operations. Through their conversations,

he realized that in his meetings he almost inevitably focused ﬁrst

(and often solely) on quarterly results. To expand the team’s thinking,

Megan suggested that he begin some meetings by asking, “What hasn’t

gone well over the last few weeks, and what have you learned from

that?” or “How have you developed your team recently?” Over time, the

team’s conversations naturally began to shift more toward group-wide

perspectives that bolstered their learning and development.

Our survey showed that many employees feel that tasks are consistently

prioritized over more spacious topics. They ranked learning, values,

purpose, creativity, and relationships as topics they’d like to talk to

their managers about above tasks. Managers need to structure meeting

agendas in a way that includes these spacious-mode topics.
