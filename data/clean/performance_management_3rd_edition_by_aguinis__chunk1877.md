# MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Although the questions asked may seem difficult to address, designing a performance management system that includes team performance is not difficult if we follow the following six basic principles:9

- 1. Make sure your team is really a team. As noted above, there are different types of teams. Before a team component is introduced in the performance management system, we need to make sure the organization has actual teams.

- 2. Make the investment to measure. Measuring team performance, as is the case with measuring individual performance, takes time and effort. The organization must be ready to make this investment for the measures to yield useful data.

- 3. Define measurement goals clearly. Defining how the data will be used (e.g., administrative vs. developmental purposes, or both) is a decision that must be made before measures of team performance are designed. As is the case with individual-level data discussed throughout the book, there are different variables that must be taken into account in relationship to the measuresâ€™ purpose (e.g., what will be the sources of data, how data will be collected, and so forth).
