# How to Create and Sustain Strategic Fit

Throughout the article, we’ll use the example of Self Esteem Brands

(SEB) to illustrate how strategic ﬁt works. (SEB has never been a client

of our ﬁrm. At the time of writing, it was in the process of changing

its name to Purpose Brands, following its merger with Orangetheory

Fitness.) We were introduced to SEB’s CEO a few months ago—after a

mutual friend, a longtime investor in the company, read several of our

articles and recognized SEB’s approach to strategy. The introduction led

to multiple interviews with Chuck Runyon, SEB’s CEO and cofounder,

followed by a deep analysis of the company’s business system.
