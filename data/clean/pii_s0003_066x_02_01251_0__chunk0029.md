# Compensation and Incentives

Traditionally, pay systems were job-based. That is, each job had an intrinsic worth (identified through the process of job evaluation) so that, in theory at least, pay stayed relatively constant regardless of who performed the job. Individual contributions were rewarded, as was position in the hierarchy and tenure on the job. Base salaries tended to increase year after year, as percentage increases yielded larger and larger amounts of money added to the base.

In today’s flatter, less hierarchical organizations, the old assumptions about pay systems are being questioned. Some organizations are rewarding employees not just for individual performance but also for the development of their skills and for team or organizational performance (Ost, 1995). Others are asking employees to put more of their pay at risk. Consider each of these trends.

In a skill- or knowledge-based pay system, workers are not paid on the basis of the job they currently are doing but rather on the basis of the number of jobs they are capable of doing, or on their depth of knowledge. In such a “learning environment,” the more workers learn, the more they earn. Workers at American Steel & Wire can boost their annual salaries by up to $12,480 by ac- quiring as many as 10 skills. Is there any impact on pro- ductivity or morale? A recent survey of 27 companies with such programs revealed that 70% to 88% reported higher job satisfaction, product quality, or productivity. Some 70% to 75% reported lower operating costs or re- duced turnover (“Skill-Based Pay,” 1992).

Such systems cannot work in all situations. They seem to work best when the following conditions exist (Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992): (a) A supportive human resource management (HRM) philosophy underpins all employment activities (such a philosophy is characterized by mutual trust and the conviction that employees have the ability and motivation to perform well); (b) HRM programs such as profit sharing, participative manage- ment, empowerment, and job enrichment complement the skill- or knowledge-based pay system; (c) technology and organization structure change frequently; (d) em- ployee exchanges (i.e., assignment and rotation) are com- mon; (e) there are opportunities to learn new skills; (f) employee turnover is relatively high; and (g) workers value teamwork and the opportunity to participate.

A second trend among many firms is to increase the proportion of pay that is at risk or variable, thereby re- ducing fixed costs. A third trend is to use team or orga-

nization-wide incentives, such as profit sharing or pro- ductivity gain sharing, to provide broader motivation than is furnished by incentive plans geared to individual em- ployees. Their aim is twofold: to increase productivity and to improve morale by giving employees a feeling of participation in and identification with the company (Florkowski, 1987).

It is important to distinguish gain sharing from profit sharing. The two approaches differ in three important ways (T. H. Hammer, 1988): (a) Gain sharing is based on a measure of productivity. Profit sharing is based on a global profitability measure. (b) Gain sharing, produc- tivity measurement, and bonus payments are frequent events, distributed monthly or quarterly, whereas the measures and rewards of profit-sharing plans are annual. (c) Gain-sharing plans are current distribution plans, in contrast to most profit-sharing plans, which have deferred payments. Hence gain-sharing plans are true incentive plans rather than employee benefits. As such, they are more directly related to individual behavior and therefore can motivate worker productivity.

Does profit sharing improve productivity? One re- view of 27 econometric studies found that profit sharing was positively related to productivity in better than 9 of every 10 instances. Productivity was generally 3% to 5% higher in firms with profit-sharing plans than in those without plans (U.S. Department of Labor, 1993).

Does gain sharing improve productivity? Of 72 companies using Improshare (Fein, 1982)—production standards based on time-and-motion studies, plus a shar- ing of productivity gains 50-50 between employees and the company-—38 companies were nonunion and 34 were represented by 18 international unions. The average gain in productivity over all companies using the plan after one year was 22.4%. Productivity gains tended to be larger if workers were provided with training and information; gains tended to be smaller, none, or negative (i.e., pro- ductivity deteriorated) if workers perceived that there was “nothing in it” for them.
