# Is a Chief of Staff Right for You?

The CoS role originated in the military and government, and it dates

back centuries. Cicero, the Roman politician and orator, used a slave

named Tiro, who, according to Cicero’s biographer Zach Bankston,

served as a secretary, a ﬁnancial overseer, and a political strategist.

Andrew Roberts’s Napoleon: A Life describes the vital role that

Louis-Alexandre Berthier played in assisting Napoleon at the height

of his powers. The historians Ron Chernow and Joseph Ellis have

described the CoS-like role that Alexander Hamilton played for George

Washington. These people aren’t to be confused with the personal

secretaries or aides-de-camp that each leader also had. Rather, they

were close advisers who handled the most-delicate strategic matters and

became trusted conﬁdants.
