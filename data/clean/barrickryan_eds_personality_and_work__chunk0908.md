# RESEARCH THEMES FOR THE FUTURE 327

formance. This may be explained partially by the fact that at that time, we were just beginning to demonstrate that personality mat- ters at work. Thus, the overall theme that emerges in these chapters is that although we have made considerable progress, there is much left to be accomplished. Further advancements require that more complex questions and methodologies be incorporated into stud- ies. In Chapter Eleven, Hough makes these points quite forcefully. Overall, each of the chapters provides stimulating and thought- provoking ways that we can further understand the relationship of personality to work-related criteria.

At least ﬁve other major themes resurface throughout this book. One that appears in several chapters is that researchers must give careful consideration to the meaning and relevance of speciﬁc personality traits. This construct-oriented approach to studying per- sonality underscores the importance of assessing appropriate traits for the questions being addressed. Second, researchers need to ac- count for mediating inﬂuences when studying relationships be- tween personality and work-related outcomes. Third, and relatedly, researchers need to account for the moderating inﬂuences of sit- uational factors when studying relationships between personality and outcomes. Fourth, researchers must specify with greater pre- cision the criteria of interest. To this end, it is clear that in order for us to advance, we must develop an accepted taxonomy of per- formance that delineates levels and content of criterion constructs. This theme recognizes the way the lack of a classiﬁcation scheme for personality traits hindered personality research more than a decade ago. Finally, researchers need to examine personality and its role with models that consider multiple levels of analysis.
