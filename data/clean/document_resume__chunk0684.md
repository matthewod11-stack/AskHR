# Performance Appraisal

Bernardin and Beatty are also LonLerned that the late' has e a deal understanding

of the purpose of the appraisal program lest the' rater distiust the process.

One factor that affects rater mon L anon has to do Vali the trust indisidual raters have in the appraisal process. Trust in the appraisal process ma) he defined as the extent to \\ hich both raters and raters perceise that the appraisal data will be for has been) rated accurately and fairly and the extent to which they per- ceive that the appraisal data will he (or has been) used find) and objecti el) for pertinent personnel decisions)]

If the raters are confused about the purpose of the appiaisal program, or if the pro- gram seems to be designed to fulfill two or more LcnraLting purposes, not 0111) might the raters lose trust in the program, they may beLome frustrated and angry as well.

For example, suppose that one objective' of an appiaisal program is to deter- mine salary increases. In this case, assessing supers isors frequent!) emphasize' the strengths of an employee if they feel that the employee deserves an increase Suppose that at the same time the apprai,,a1 program, is being used to improve performance. With this objective in mind, the assessing supervisor may feel obligated to point out an emplo)ee's relam e weaknesses in order to identify areas for improL einem. Ines itabl), the assessing supers isors will find themselves in a frustrating, if not untenable, position al attempting to use the assessments for these differing, purposes i2

It was recognized at least sixt) yea's ago that knowledge of the purpose for which ratings wer: to be used might influenLe the scores pros ided, therefore, the Lon% entional wisdom was as follows. "To as oid this enoi, ratings should he secured w raters in ignorance of their use and if possible at a time in advance of the slaw .on demanding their use." 13

Given Bernardm and Beatt)'s LonLerns about trust in the appraisal process, it is likely that tills cons entional wisdom Lould do with some es ision. Administiatiirs who desire to consn net a performarke appraisal s) stem w bleb V ill be accepted and used should inform the potential rate's of all intended uses of the iesulting data This will at least reduce any distortion and LarianLe in ratings due to SpCl. lad t on regaiding their use.

As a final note, 'while perfoimance apps nsal ratings can indeed be used foi a s ari- ety of purposes, Loncrgan suggests that setting indRidual development as the primary objective of an appraisal program has at least four ads antages.

The program is likely to be more acceptable to employees and to gain their support rather than arouse their iesentment,

There is less obvious reason for the assessing supervisors to introduce deliberate distortion into the assessments to achieve their OW11
