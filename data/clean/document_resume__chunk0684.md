(is) inappro- priate since (it is) typically not ba..ed on a common measurement scheme. If there is low trust among raters, and if ratings are linked to important personnel decisions . then the forced- choice method is recommended since it is more resistant to deliberate rating inflation than other methods. If the Behav- iorally Anchored Raring Scale (BARS) method is to be adopted, then diary- keeping should be incorporated as a formal component of the process. . Such an approach is not only more effective at inhibiting halo than oth,-r methods; it also provides documentation for summary ratings and a data source for validating individual raters If the purpose of appraisal is test validation, then the relatively high levels of reliability and satiability for personnel -com- parison methods certainly support their use, providing a behavioral format is adopted for the comparisons and assumptions can be met for comparisons across raters is to improve performance, then MBO is the best strategy, providing uncontaminated, quantifiable data are available. ...17
