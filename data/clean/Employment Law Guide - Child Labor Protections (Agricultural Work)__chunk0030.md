## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Every employer of employees subject to the FLSA's minimum wage provisions must post, and keep posted, a

of their establishments. Although there is no size requirement for the poster, employees must be able to

readily read it. The FLSA poster is also available in
