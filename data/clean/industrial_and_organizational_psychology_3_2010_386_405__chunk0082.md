- Do the philosophical and methodolog- ical traditions of JDM have much to offer IOOB? Would IOOB beneﬁt (e.g., in terms of disciplinary prestige and the ability to inﬂuence public policy) from developing more normative mod- els and a tighter paradigm (e.g., Pfeffer, 1993)? Does IOOB emphasize exter- nal validity to the detriment of internal validity? Should IOOB be less resis- tant to lab studies? If your answer to these questions is a deﬁnitive ‘‘no,’’ what concerns do you have about the prevailing philosophical and method- ological traditions in JDM?

- Have additional IOOB content areas (beyond the ones speciﬁed in this article) already been enriched sub- stantially by JDM—and, if so, what was most useful about JDM in these areas?Couldadditional IOOB content areas beneﬁt substantially from JDM in the future and vice versa?
