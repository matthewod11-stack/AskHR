## Developing New Research on Humor and Culture in Organizations

maintain the harmony required in their ingroups, collectivists tend to make a greater distinction between self-ingroup and self-outgroup relationships. This can be achieved by displaying negative emotions to outgroups and pleasant emotions to ingroups. Indeed, Matsumoto (1990) found that collectivists rated negative feelings as more appropriate in the presence of outgroup than ingroup members.

This suggests that members of individualistic cultures, who usually belong to a number of ingroups and who feel comfortable with relatively superﬁcial relationships, do not differentiate between ingroups and outgroups as readily as do members of collective cultures. Therefore, they are unlikely to present different emotions based on the self-group relationship, and are more likely to display emotions according to their internal feelings. Under such conditions, positive emotions resulting from humor are most likely to be displayed and transmitted to others. Similarly, in collectivistic cultures, when the individuals within one’s social sphere are members of one’s ingroup, people are more readily affected by the positive mood invoked by humor, are likely to display their positive affect behaviorally (e.g., smiles and laughter), and perhaps initiate more humor because positive affect is appropriate. This creates conditions that are likely to result in positive emotional contagion. In contrast, when a collectivist group is composed of individuals who consider each other to be outgroup, they will be less inclined to appreciate humor, to react to it behaviorally, or to initiate humor. As a result, positive affect from humor is not likely to spread and build through emotional contagion.
