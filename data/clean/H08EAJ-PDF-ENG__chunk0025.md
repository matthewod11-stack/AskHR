# its members.

Listen actively. To support your team members, our research indicates

that it’s essential to oﬀer speciﬁc times and spaces for them team

to express their feelings and process the situation. Facilitated group

discussions, counseling sessions, or informal gatherings can make a

signiﬁcant diﬀerence. You can look to HR or your employee assistance

program for resources and guidance on how to do this.

One manager recalled how he held weekly group discussions where

everyone could share their feelings. These sessions provided a

structured yet empathetic environment for employees to voice their

concerns and support each other. Our ﬁndings also showed that the

need for emotional support evolves as the illness progresses, and

managers should remain ﬂexible, adapting the format and frequency

of these discussions based on team needs and feedback.

During these discussions, signal active listening by nodding along, maintaining eye contact, and oﬀering aﬃrmations like “I understand”

or “I hear you.” By being fully present, managers can reinforce

a compassionate and cohesive team dynamic even in the most

challenging situation.
