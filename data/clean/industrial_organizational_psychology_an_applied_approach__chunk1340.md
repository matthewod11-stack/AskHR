# Legal Issues

As you might recall from Chapter , methods used to select employees are most prone to legal challenge when they result in adverse impact, invade an applicant’s privacy, and do not appear to be job related (lack face validity). As shown in Table ., cognitive ability and GPA will result in the highest levels of adverse impact, whereas integrity tests, references, and personality inventories will result in the lowest levels (in viewing this table, you might want to review the concept of d scores and effect sizes discussed in Chapter ). In terms of face validity, applicants perceive interviews, work samples/simulations, and résumés as being the most job related/fair, and they

view graphology, biodata, and personality tests as being the least job related/fair (Rynes & Connerley, ; Smither et al., ; Steiner & Gilliland, ).
