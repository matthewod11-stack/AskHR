In a recent study, we developed a theoretical model to shed light on the

demand for salary benchmarking. In our model, ﬁrms know exactly how

much value the job candidate would bring to the table. The ﬁrm would

like to oﬀer the candidate below that value to keep some of the value

as proﬁt. However, how much lower should the oﬀer be? The lower the

oﬀer, the better the savings. On the other hand, if the oﬀer is too low,

the ﬁrm risks losing the job candidate to another ﬁrm — they may turn

down the oﬀer, or accept the oﬀer and leave shortly thereafter.

So, whether the company wants to make a more or less aggressive oﬀer

depends critically on what the ﬁrm believes is the market value of the job candidate: i.e., how much other ﬁrms are willing to pay for the job

candidate. That’s where salary benchmarking comes in: ﬁrms can use

data on the oﬀers accepted by similar employees (e.g., with the same

position title and industry) to make sure that their oﬀer is not too low, or
