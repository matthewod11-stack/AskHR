In this mapping (represented by a circle), design falls in the fourth quadrant because it is highly synthetic and strongly concerned with real-world subject mat- ter. However, because disciplines of design deal with communications and sym- bolism, design has a symbolic component, and because design requires analysis to perform synthesis, there is also an analytic component (Owen, 2007).

It is important to note that a case can be made for the positioning of any field to the left or the right of the map. However, mapping fields is relative and not abso- lute, which is important because this mapping provides a means for comparing the relationships among different fields with respect to the two dimensions: content and process. Each of the four quadrants in this figure is important in education because we want our students to develop higher-order thinking skills and be able to analyze, synthesize, innovate, and thus readily deal with real-world problems. According to Hatchuel and Weil (2009), design can be modeled as a relation- ship between two interdependent spaces with different structures and logic: the space of concepts (C) and the space of knowledge (K). Space K contains all estab- lished knowledge available for designers, while Space C includes concepts that are neither true nor false in K about an object. Design proceeds in a step-by-step par- titioning of C-sets until a partitioned C-set becomes a K-set, that is, a set of objects, well defined by a true proposition in K. Thus, for Hatchuel and Weil, design is a reasoning activity that starts with a concept about a partially unknown object and attempts to expand it into other concepts and/or new knowledge.

At its core, design thinking refers to how designers see and how they conse- quently think (Liu, 1996). It is an iterative and interactive process where designers (a) see what is there in some representation of problem-solving concepts/ideas, (b) draw relations between ideas to solve the problem, and (c) view what has been
