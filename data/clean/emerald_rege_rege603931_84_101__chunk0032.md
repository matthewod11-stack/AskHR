has majority of male professionals. Almost half of responders (48.5 percent) are between 25 and 29 years old, which means a very young public. Because of the very young profile of the employees, it is natural that a considerable part of them is still single; in this case, more than half (54.7 percent).

The schooling of responders is an important result. Although the public being very young, 45 percent of responders are post-degree graduates, being stricto or lato sensus. It is important to highlight that 25.1 percent has finished the master’s degree and many of them are pursuing Master’s. This characteristic is already weighted because it is about a Research and Development institute in IT area.

It is relevant to quote the high indexes of institute rotativity. As an example, in 2008, the level of oxygenation of the enterprise (sum of voluntary and involuntary turnover) was around 34.1 percent (Human Capital of T.E.C). Even if they considered this information, it is valid to highlight that 27.5 percent of responders worked at the Institute at most for four years and only 13.5 percent has more than five years in service.

Related to senior level of technical professionals, which variates from technical level to specialist level, the higher concentration occurs in levels junior and full, which represent 69.6 percent of the sample. However, it is important to highlight that the most frequent senior level was the junior with 36.3 percent of responders and that 19.9 percent are seniors or specialists.

Organizational commitment level was investigated according to Meyer et al.’s (1993) model. Table III exposes the averages, the standard deviation and the Cronbach’s α of construct dimensions, as well as the percentage of responders who presented each type of commitment. For result effects, it was considered that an average over 3.0 (three), in a score scale from 1 to 5, represents a positive answer to the perception of organizational commitment and its dimensions.

Through the verification of commitment dimensions in relation to the average, the researched individuals presented a considerable affective commitment in relation to the average (average 3.6), being this the only dimension considered positive by chosen parameters. The information contained in Table III corroborates this vision, since 85 percent of responders demonstrate to be affectively committed. This result suggests the existence of an affective bond and highlights the emotional nature which may unite the individual to organization, in function of the attending expectations and special necessities. In this context, quoting Allen and Meyer (1990), the individual remains in organization because he wishes.

The instrumental commitment was under the average (2.5). This may indicate that the employees remain in Institute because other reasons, but not because of reasons related to instrumental commitment, that is, fearing the costs or associated losses to its leaving, necessity, etc. (Medeiros and Enders, 1998).

According to Rego et al. (2005), probably the employees that have a strong emotional bond do not have any pretension to empower the organization something else beyond that
