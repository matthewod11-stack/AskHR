# 5.1.2 Determining Objectives

After the accountabilities have been identified, the next step in measuring results is to determine specific objectives. Objectives are statements of an important and measurable outcome that, when accomplished, will help ensure success for the accountability. The purpose of establishing objectives is to identify a limited number of highly impor- tant results that, when achieved, will have a dramatic impact on the overall success of the organization. After objectives are set, employees should receive feedback on their progress toward attaining the objective. Rewards should be allocated to those employees who have reached their objectives.

Objectives are clearly important because they help employees guide their efforts.

To serve a useful function, objectives must have the following characteristics5:

- 1. Specific and clear. Objectives must be easy to understand. In addition, they must be verifiable and measurable, for example, a directive: “Cut travel cost by 20%.” 2. Challenging. Objectives need to be challenging (but not impossible to achieve). They must be a stretch, but employees should feel that the objective is reachable. 3. Agreed upon. To be most effective, objectives need to result from an agreement between the manager and the employee. Employees need an opportunity to participate in setting objectives. Participation in the process increases objective aspirations and acceptance, and it decreases objective resistance.

- 4. Significant. Objectives must be important to the organization. Employees must believe that if the objective is achieved, it will make a critical impact on the overall suc- cess of the organization. In addition, achieving the objective should give the employee the feeling of congruence between the employee’s performance and the goals of the organization. This, in turn, is likely to enhance feelings of value to the organization. 5. Prioritized. Not all objectives are created equal; therefore, objectives should be prioritized and tackled one by one.

- 6. Bound by time. Good objectives have deadlines and mileposts. Objectives lacking a time dimension are likely to be neglected.

- 7. Achievable. Good objectives are doable; that is, employees should have sufficient skills and training to achieve them. If they don’t, then the organization should make resources available so that the necessary skills are learned and equipment is made available to achieve the goals.

- 8. Fully communicated.

In addition to the manager and employee in question, the other organizational members who may be affected by the objectives need to be aware of them.
