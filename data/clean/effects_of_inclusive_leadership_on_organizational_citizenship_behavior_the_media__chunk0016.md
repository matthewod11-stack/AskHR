Tepper and Taylor (2003) emphasized that employees perform OCB with greater frequency when they perceive fairness from their supervi- sors or the organization. We argue that organizational justice is positively related to OCB for three main reasons. The first under- lying reason could be that high perceived organizational justice makes employees feel satisfied with the working procedures and the organization, so motivating them to engage in extra-role behaviors (Bingham, 1997). The second reason is that organiza- justice engenders employees’ trust in the organization tional (Aryee et al., 2002), which is relevant to the civic virtue dimension of citizenship behavior (Robinson, 1996; Robinson & Morrison, 1995). Konovsky and Pugh (1994) posited that procedural justice positively influences employees’ trust in their leaders and the organization, which motivates them to exhibit OCB.
