## Our information doesn’t align with the information in the world around

us. And that phase of disequilibrium, we then use it to help us. We don’t

like to be in disequilibrium.

So we seek to get to resolve. We need to relearn. We need to know again,

revise our mental models. And we’re collectively as a society going

through that process right now. A lot of the things that we understood

to be true are evolving. And now this period of disequilibrium can feel

really stressful because the mental models you operate on aren’t really

working anymore. But this is where, if we take that discomfort and

we stand in it and we get curious about it and we recognize that that

discomfort is actually the thing that’s going to help us get to a new level

of understanding, well, we can make really great things happen in that

process. And so disequilibrium is this beautiful stage that shows you

you’re in a mode of learning.

I’d offer to anybody listening to really embrace that stage and recognize

how essential it is for learning and growth, and that it is a creative

act. We actually have that capability in us to really bring creativity

and redesign the way we understand and the way we create the world
