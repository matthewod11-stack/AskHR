## Legality of Preferential Hiring and Promotion Plans

Recently, the courts have indicated that any form of preferential hiring or pro- motion must undergo a “strict scrutiny analysis,” in which the plan must be nar- rowly tailored and meet a compelling government interest (Gutman, ). The various courts have ruled that achieving diversity in such settings as a univer- sity ( Grutter v. Bollinger, ) and a police department (Petit v. City of Chicago, ) are compelling government interests.

If the plan does not meet a compelling government interest, it is illegal. If it does meet a compelling government interest, as shown in Figure ., the courts use five criteria to “strictly scrutinize” the extent to which an affirmative action plan involving preferential hiring is narrowly tailored. It is always legal to monitor employment statistics, actively recruit minorities, and remove bar- riers discouraging women and minorities from being hired or staying with an organization.
