Imagine that you are a salesperson. You’ve noticed that prospective

clients always contact you several times after your meetings with them,

asking you more or less the same kind of questions, which often delays

contract signing. One morning, you spend time and eﬀort thinking

about how to improve this aspect of the process, and after imagining

diﬀerent solutions, you opt for compiling a list of FAQs to provide to

prospective clients right before sending them your contract.
