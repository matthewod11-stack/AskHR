## such as a preference for indirect communication, formality, or long

investments in relationship building, the British negotiator observed

how she actually behaved.

From the start, he saw that she was extremely friendly, shook his hand,

greeted him in English with a slight American accent, and explained

that she valued quick decision-making and innovation, having worked

at a tech startup in Silicon Valley for many years prior to creating her

signaled her intention to collaborate. Noticing those traits, the British

negotiator reciprocated with an equally open, collaborative style, which

helped them establish a strong working rapport.
