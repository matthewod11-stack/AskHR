ABSTRACT:

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) is a crucial aspect of workplace management and employee well-being. It encompasses a comprehensive set of principles, practices, and regulations aimed at safeguarding workers from potential hazards and ensuring a safe and healthy work environment. OHS measures include risk assessment, hazard identification, and the implementation of safety protocols, training, and the provision of necessary safety equipment. By prioritizing OHS, organizations not only protect their employees from accidents and illnesses but also enhance productivity and morale. Additionally, adherence to OHS standards is often mandated by government authorities to ensure compliance with legal and ethical responsibilities. In today's rapidly evolving work landscape, OHS remains a vital consideration, especially as new technologies and work practices emerge, requiring ongoing adaptation and innovation to address emerging risks and protect the physical and mental well-being of employees in diverse industries and settings.
