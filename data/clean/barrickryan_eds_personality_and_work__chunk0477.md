## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 137

mance (Barrick & Mount, 1991). If performance feedback, both external and internal, can have affective consequences, then con- scientiousness may enter into an affect generation process. Specif- ically, those who are more conscientious do a good job and receive positive feedback, which leads to positive emotional reactions (pride); those who are less conscientious do not do such a good job, resulting in negative feedback and negative emotional reac- tions (dejection).

Reactivity to similar events can vary among individuals, and this variability can be related to personality differences. Weiss et al. (1999) showed that intraindividual variability in self-reports of mood over a three-week period could be predicted by individual differences in Larsen and Diener’s Affect Intensity Measure (AIM; 1987), and Kurek et al. (2001) replicated this ﬁnding in their sam- ple of graduate students. These studies replicate in the workplace numerous other studies conducted by Larsen and his colleagues on various nonwork samples. Larsen and Diener consider the AIM a measure of affective reactivity to events, both positive and nega- tive. In support of this interpretation, Larsen, Diener, and Emmons (1986) showed that AIM differences in a student sample predicted the strength of emotional responses to a constant set of emotional events among these students. Although more recent research has questioned the factorial purity of the AIM (Bryant, Yarnold, & Grim, 1996), Larsen’s research does illustrate stable individual dif- ferences in reactivity to emotional events.

Frequently found relationships between trait extraversion and neuroticism and aggregate mood states can also be explained by differential reactivity to positive and negative events. In a series of studies, Larsen and colleagues (Larsen & Ketelaar, 1989, 1991; Rusting & Larsen, 1999; Zelenski & Larsen, 1999) have shown that extraversion predicts responsivity to positive but not negative mood inductions, and neuroticism predicts responsivity to negative but not positive mood inductions.

An alternate personality structure, one coming from investi- gations into the physiology of affective reactions, also supports the logic of individual differences in reactivity to affective events. Gray (1987) proposed two physiological systems, one reacting to posi- tive stimuli and the other negative stimuli. These behavioral ap- proach and behavioral inhibition systems are thought to integrate motivational, emotional, and personality ﬁndings. Much research
