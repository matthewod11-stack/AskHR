# Give Positive Reinforcement

Now that you’ve taken the time to look back and assess what’s

happening, reset the focus to the present state. Set the tone of the

conversation by acknowledging the employee’s strengths and desire to

do well. Emphasizing empathy and understanding will show them that

the discussion is about growth and development rather than criticism.

You want to communicate that you believe improvement is possible

and that you and the team are here to support them through their self-

improvement journey. As Charles Schwab said, “The way to develop the

best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.”
