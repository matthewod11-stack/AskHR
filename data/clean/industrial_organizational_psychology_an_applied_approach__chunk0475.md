# Conducting a Job Analysis

Although there are many ways to conduct a job analysis, the goal of most job analyses is to identify the tasks performed in a job, the conditions under which the tasks are performed, and the KSAOs needed to perform the tasks under the conditions identiﬁ ed. Th is section will begin with a commonly used strategy for conducting a job analysis and conclude with descriptions of alternative methods.

Step 1: Identify Tasks Performed Th e ﬁ rst step in conducting a job analysis is to identify the major job dimensions and the tasks performed for each dimension, the tools and equipment used to perform the tasks, and the conditions under which the tasks are performed. Th is information is usually gathered by obtaining previous information on the job, interviewing job incumbents, observing performance, or actually performing the job itself.

Gathering Existing Information. Prior to interviewing incumbents, it is always a good idea to gather information that has already been obtained. For example, one might gather existing job descriptions, task inventories, and training manuals. Th is information might come from the organization with which you are working, other organizations, trade publications, and journal articles.

Interviewing Subject Matter Experts. Th e most common method of conducting a job analysis is to interview subject matter experts (SMEs). SMEs are people who are knowledgeable about the job and include job incumbents, supervisors, cus- tomers, and upper-level management. Job analysis interviews diﬀ er greatly from employment interviews in that the purpose of the job analysis interview is to obtain information about the job itself rather than about the person doing the
