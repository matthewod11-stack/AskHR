# Brain Measurement

At midcentury observation of the structure and function of the living brain was conﬁned to measuring the electrophysi- ology of brain activity with the electroencephalogram (EEG) and x-ray photography. These were replaced by various kinds of brain imaging that depended on the availability of high- powered computers and upon new ways of scanning the brain’s metabolic activity. The major forms of brain imaging (brain “scanning”) are positron emission tomography (PET), computerized tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All of these methods rely on the fact that

brain activity requires energy and this energy comes from in- creased metabolic activity in the brain area doing the work. PET and CT scans begin with an injection of brieﬂy acting radio-active material into the blood stream to mark changes in blood ﬂow and blood concentration, thereby indicating where the increased metabolic activity is taking place. These scan methods require keeping radioactive material in the lab- oratory, and the injections are somewhat intrusive. These methods also are expensive and are limited as to the clarity of the images of brain structure they provide.

For all of these reasons, use of these scans has been gen- erally superseded by magnetic resonance imaging. Not until 1959 was MRI used for medical diagnosis, and not until the 1970s did it came into general use for body imaging. MRI could detect natural changes in blood oxygen levels (an index of metabolic activity) without using radioactive materials. High-speed scanning of the whole brain in a few milliseconds enabled the investigator to study rapid localized brain activ- ity changes during mental activity. Additionally, improve- ments in EEG made it possible to study the rise and fall of electrophysiological activity at speciﬁc points in the brain in real time.
