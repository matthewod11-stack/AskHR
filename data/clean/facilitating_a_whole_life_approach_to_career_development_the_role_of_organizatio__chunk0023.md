## How Organizational Leadership Supports Whole-Life Career Development

Whereas finding balance between work and nonwork was once viewed as a burden that fell to employ- ees’ to manage, many employers now grasp the benefit of being involved in work–life management (Major, Burke, & Fiskenbaum, 2013). Across organizational leadership levels, managers play an essential role in supporting the balance of employees’ needs for whole-life development. In this sec- tion, we focus on the contributions of upper- and lower level organizational leaders and the importance of aligned work–life support across leadership levels. Upper level leadership is comprised of executive managers, senior leaders, and human resource (HR) executives. Lower level leadership includes immediate supervisors and frontline managers. We contend that organizational leadership plays a vital role both in restructuring the organizational culture to be flexible and accepting of employees’ personal growth needs and in communicating and facilitating their policies and expectations at an individual level.
