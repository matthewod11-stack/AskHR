# an issue?

In our research, across multiple studies, we asked respondents to

indicate to what extent they believed inequity was a problem. In one

survey, managers reported that inequity was 13% less of an issue in

their workplace compared to non-managers. In a diﬀerent survey, we

found that managers scored only 2% lower than non-managers when

rating inequity in other workplaces — but when rating it in their own

workplace, they scored 17% lower.
