# Conclusions

The extraordinary popularity of the NPS question resulted in market demand for a similar construction in employee satisfaction and engagement research. In the author opinion, the eNPS item is good for a general opinion evaluation. Still many differently constructed questions may lead to similar results. Using a single-item measure provides information about general opinion but does not give the compa- ny’s managers any further information. The manager will know if his team is happy or not, but will not have access to the reason of such an opinion. The eNPS alone will not help to improve the situation in the company as it is not directed at any factors causing satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

On the plus side of the eNPS, there is certainly simplicity. The question does not require any special instructions for respondents, it is easily understood by manage- ment. An exception is the score itself which may be below 0 in situations when the majority of the people chose, for example, 7 and 8 on the 0 to 10 scale. This last is- sue in the authors opinion is the biggest disadvantage of the eNPS, especially when used by people who do not know how the score is calculated.
