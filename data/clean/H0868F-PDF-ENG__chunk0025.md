## Be Patient and Prepare to Invest in What Matters

There’s no magic app to make people happier at work. Becoming a

more mentally healthy organization is a commitment to change the

fundamentals, and it starts with leadership. Psychologist Emily Anhalt

says organizations must embrace this reality: “This will not be a quick

and easy thing. This is a forever journey that you have to decide is worth

your while.”
