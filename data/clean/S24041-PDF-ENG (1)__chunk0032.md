## HBR / Spotlight Article / Power, Influence, and CEO Succession

For example, engineering and scientiﬁc organizations usually respond

best to assertive persuasion because it’s based on facts and logic.

People at sales-oriented companies tend to respond to incentives and

disincentives and to praise for achieving targets and feedback on

Enhance your power by acting in a humble manner. Even once she’s

been publicly identiﬁed as the heir apparent, the designated successor

should tread carefully and never act as if her promotion to CEO

is inevitable. Coming across as too conﬁdent oﬀers ammunition to

opponents and strengthens resistance. She should solicit opinions and
