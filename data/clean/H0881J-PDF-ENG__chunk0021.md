# HBR / Digital Article / How to Talk to an Employee Who Isn’t Meeting Expectations

I architect a well-structured meeting. I prepare a clear agenda and

assign sections of it to speciﬁc team members. Giving everyone a

role in how the meeting runs makes everyone feel involved, sets the

expectation that everyone is accountable for coming prepared, and

ensures no one dominates the conversation. It also allows me to lead

by example: The team sees what a well-run meeting looks like and

how they can adapt the structure for their own meetings.

Ask your employee to share their honest opinion about what is leading

to this feedback, then sit in silence and give them space to share their

thoughts. More often than not, they will take some accountability for

their results. If they don’t, they may not be coachable.
