## the gatekeepers for all learning and development, and collaborate to

develop talent. Mark recast his strategy in this way, and a few months

later it received a green light. And in time it has delivered. During

Mark’s tenure, leadership development has come to span all regions

and business groups—and the percentage of senior leadership roles

ﬁlled by internal candidates has reached the company’s target. In a

recent round of top management appointments, 100% were internal

candidates, saving the company money and raising its proﬁle as a

workplace where talent is given opportunities to develop and lead.
