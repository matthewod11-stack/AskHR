I would also like to thank my family, friends, and students for accommodating my time spent writing and for all their ideas and support. I appreciate my col- leagues Mark Nagy, Tom Pierce, Michael Surrette, and David Cohen, who patiently allowed me to bounce ideas oﬀ them, vent, and ask dumb questions. Th anks also to my SIOP, IPMA, IPMAAC, and SHRM colleagues for their insight and stories. Th ere is no way I can properly express my gratitude to my mentor, Dr. Wilson W. Kimbrough, who taught me much more than facts and theories, and to Dr. Al Harris and Dr. Daniel Johnson, who have been so supportive throughout my career.

Finally, I thank my wife Bobbie and son Josh for their love and emotional sup- port. Most of the time, writing a book is an enjoyable process. However, during the times I was stressed or confused (an increasingly common occurrence), my family was always patient and understanding. I could not have done this, or much of anything, without them. I would also like to thank Bobbie for her contributions in helping write the stress chapter, the section on organizational culture, all of the Focus on Ethics boxes, and several of the Career Workshop boxes.
