# The ACT IF Framework

An organization can respond to employee activism in diﬀerent ways

depending upon the issue and context. In the opening example, we

outlined how diﬀerent executives wanted to respond. Some reacted

angrily, pushing for the employee to be reprimanded and cautioned.

Others appeared more open, and there was even the suggestion that

this activist employee be invited to the next leadership meeting to

lead a discussion. Our ACT IF framework describes ﬁve key inﬂuencing

factors that should shape the leadership response. (It can also be used

by activists in choosing which actions to take.)
