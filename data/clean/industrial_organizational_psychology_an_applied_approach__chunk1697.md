# Motivation

Quality is a relevant criterion for many jobs.

Quality of Work. Another method to evaluate performance is by measuring the qual- ity of the work that is done. Quality is usually measured in terms of errors, which are defined as deviations from a standard. Thus, to obtain a measure of qual- ity, there must be a standard against which to compare an employee’s work. For example, a seamstress’s work quality would be judged by how it compares with a “model” shirt; a secretary’s work quality would be judged by the number of typos (the standard being correctly spelled words); and a cook’s quality might be judged by how her food resembles a standard as measured by size, temperature, and ingredient amounts.

Kentucky Fried Chicken, for example, evaluates the quality of its franchises’ food by undercover inspectors. These inspectors purchase food, drive down the road, and after parking, use a thermometer to see whether the food has been served at a standard acceptable temperature and also a scale to determine whether the weight of the mashed potatoes is within the acceptable range.

Note that the definition of an error is any deviation from a standard. Thus, errors can even be work quality that is higher than a standard. Why is this an error? Suppose a company manufactures shirts that are sold for $. To keep down the manufacturing cost of its shirts, the company probably uses cheaper material and has its workers spend less time per shirt than does a company that manufactures $ shirts (these are not the shirts I buy). Thus, if an employee sews a shirt with  stitches per inch instead of the standard , the company will lose money because of higher quality!

When I was working my way through school, I held a summer job at an amusement park. The job involved wearing a pink and purple uniform and cook- ing prefabricated pizza. The standard for the large pepperoni pizza was  hand- fuls of cheese and  pieces of pepperoni. Now all pizza lovers recognize this to be a barren pizza. The cooks thus tried to increase the pizza quality by tri- pling the number of pepperoni pieces. The management quickly explained to the young “gourmet chefs” that exceeding the standards was considered poor work performance and that employees who did so would be fired.
