A similar situation developed at a factory that produced parts for telephones. Most of the employees were older and took great pride in their work quality and in the fact that their parts had the lowest percentage of errors in the company. They were told, however, that their quality was too high and that the parts were lasting so long that the company was not getting much repeat business. Quality errors can occur in many strange ways!

Attendance. A common method for objectively measuring one aspect of an employee’s performance is by looking at attendance (this is discussed in greater detail in Chapter ). Attendance can be separated into three distinct criteria: absenteeism, tardiness, and tenure. Both absenteeism and tardiness have obvious implications for the performance appraisal process. The weight that each has in the overall evaluation of the employee largely depends on the nature of the job.

Tenure as a criterion, however, is used mostly for research purposes when evaluating the success of selection decisions. For example, in a job such as food preparer at McDonald’s, there is probably little difference in the quantity and quality of hamburgers or French fries that are cooked. But an employee might be considered “successful” if she stays with the company for at least four months and “unsuccessful” if she leaves before that time. In fact, the importance of ten- ure can be demonstrated by noting that several major fast-food restaurants and convenience stores have established bonus systems to reward long-tenure employees—that is, those who have worked for a company at least six months. For each hour the employee works, the company places a specified amount of money into an account that can be used by the employee to pay such education expenses as books and tuition.

Safety. Another method used to evaluate the success of an employee is safety. Obviously, employees who follow safety rules and who have no occupational accidents do not cost an organization as much money as those who break rules, equipment, and possibly their own bodies. As with tenure, safety is usually used for research purposes, but it can also be used for employment decisions such as promotions and bonuses.

Ratings of Performance The most commonly used option in evaluating performance is to have supervi- sors rate how well the employee performed on each dimension. Though there are many variations of how these rating scales can be created, the two most common are the graphic rating scale and the behavioral checklist.

Graphic Rating Scale. The most common rating scale is the graphic rating scale. An example is shown in Table .. As you can see, such scales are fairly simple, with  to  dimensions accompanied by words such as “excellent” and “poor” anchor- ing the ends of the scale.
