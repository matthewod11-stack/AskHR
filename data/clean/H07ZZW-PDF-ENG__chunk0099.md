# work awaits.

Once you have been explicit and deliberate about employee

involvement in strategy, ethics, politics, and human rights, you’ll be

better equipped to make consistent decisions on how to address social

and political issues. Your employees may not always agree, and you

must be clear from the outset as to whether they’re allowed to disagree

publicly. But because they’ve been involved throughout the process,

and there has been clear consideration of how these issues will aﬀect

organizational culture, they should better understand what you are (or

are not) saying — and why.
