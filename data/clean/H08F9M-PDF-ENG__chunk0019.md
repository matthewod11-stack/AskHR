# miserable.

But the glimmer of promise we saw in the earliest days of the Covid-19

crisis should give us hope. When we loosen our grip on consolidated

power and control and expand our myopic focus on short-term costs

(to prioritize people, purpose and real productivity) something great —

even miraculous — can happen. This is the lesson of the last few years

— and it isn’t a new one.

But still — almost universally — we revert to power and control in

the name of the need of the times for quick ﬁxes. In doing so, we

continue to embrace a legacy paradigm that is driven by the pursuit

and maintenance of power over people. And the story we tell ourselves

— and the one we reward — is that this is good leadership.

But the truth is that this paradigm — what we call the “power-over”

paradigm — is the very reason executives ﬁnd themselves frustrated

that they aren’t getting as much out of their people and organizations as

they believe they could be.

This is the paradox of the power-over paradigm: We have a tendency

to default to its ways of thinking, behaving, and organizing, even as it

serves to limit our capacity to make things better.
