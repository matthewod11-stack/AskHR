## HBR / Digital Article / Research: The Gender Wage Gap Tipping Point

While there are numerous proposed explanations for this persistent

gender wage gap—including women choosing to work in lower-

paying jobs or working fewer hours than men, leaving the workforce for

caregiving responsibilities, or facing gender bias and discrimination—

some have argued that simply increasing the representation of women

in the workforce is enough to naturally eliminate the gap.

We know that this “add women and stir” approach is important and can

yield some improvements, but it isn’t enough on its own to solve the

persistent wage gap problem. However, we wondered whether there is

a speciﬁc point where the proportion of women in a given occupation

meaningfully aﬀects how much they’re paid compared to men.
