# Making the Decision

For some matters, such as setting the overall performance targets of the

company, the CEO may be the principal decision-maker, choosing to

make the ﬁnal call after a set of recommendations have been presented.

In other situations, the CEO may choose to consult with a small group of

key executives and board members, as in the case of M&A deals, or while

selecting top management team members. In other situations, such as

formulating a business unit’s strategy, the CEO may let others, such as

the business unit heads, make decisions, and then endorse them. In yet

other circumstances, such as deciding which R&D projects the company

should pursue, although the CEO may participate at some stage to better

understand the choices under consideration, the CEO may delegate the

ﬁnal decision to a senior manager such as the head of R&D, because the

CEO may lack the technical expertise to weigh in.
