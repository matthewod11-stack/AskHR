When Alex took on his new C-suite role, he realized that some of the

skills he was cultivating with his family—active listening, recognizing

and managing his own emotions, asking more than telling—might be

useful to him as a leader, so he tried them out. The feedback he received

was positive, and he kept going. Previously, he had sought to push his

unit’s interests over those of his peers’, but now, gradually, he started

seeing win-win opportunities. What he had learned on the inside, in his

personal life, helped accelerate his journey.

Enlisting helpers. At every stage in the development journey, you need

partners who can hold you accountable, provide honest feedback, help

you connect the dots, and hold up mirrors revealing your true nature.
