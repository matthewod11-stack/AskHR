y found that

when people saw rudeness among colleagues, their creativity and

decision-making suﬀered. Over time, teams that tolerate low-level

unkindness risk normalizing it, eroding group cohesion, psychological

safety, engagement, and retention. That breakdown of social capital

weakens the organization’s edge as a service provider and employer of

# choice.

Kindness changes the picture. When staﬀ feel noticed, valued, and

respected, they are more willing to help each other, collaborate, and

solve problems. The biggest predictors of retention aren’t money or

workload; they are social. What matters most is respect, inclusion,

pride in our work, and team relationships. Kindness supports all of

these. It builds cultures of safety, trust, and care. And when people

often align. When staﬀ feel respected, patients tend to feel respected

too. When teamwork is strong, patients notice, and safety outcomes

improve. But when staﬀ don’t feel respected or safe enough to speak up,

they are more likely to leave, and patients trust the care less.

# A Leadership Imperative

Creating workplaces where kindness is the norm starts with a

company’s top leaders. They need to make kindness visible and align

it with what people experience. In other words, don’t just say it matters,

show it. Kindness is easy when things are smooth. The real test is how

people behave when work gets tense or relationships strain. That’s when

leaders need to create space for diﬀerent views, listen for points of

friction, and understand what gets in the way of kindness.

In diﬃcult situations, silence is a manifestation of unkindness. If people

aren’t speaking up, problems linger, and mistakes get buried. Rejecting

silence with kindness requires leaders to be intentional about what

gets rewarded, appreciated, challenged, or ignored. Unkindness must

be actively discouraged.

One CEO who understands this is Microsoft’s Satya Nadella. He has

made kindness, empathy, and curiosity integral to what it means to

lead well at his company. He has recognized that such an environment

## fosters innovation, collaboration, and trust.

Leaders who take kindness seriously build systems to support it. One

such system is Cleveland Clinic’s annual professional review process.

All physicians take part in a structured, face-to-face review each year,

where their performance, goals, and direction are discussed. Each

physician is required to set a personal improvement goal for the year

ahead; some might want to learn a new technique, improve their

communication skills, or get better at teaching. Feedback ﬂows both

ways, and people are asked to reﬂect on what’s working, what’s not, and

what support they might need. That kind of structure sets the tone. It

builds a culture of trust, clarity, and shared responsibility. It is a way

of hardwiring kindness into the organization in the sense that people

are given time, attention, and respect. That signals to people that they

matter, and that the organization is invested in their s
