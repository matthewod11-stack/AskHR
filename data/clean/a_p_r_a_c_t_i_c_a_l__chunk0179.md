# Guardrails

Well-designed guardrails help you manage data privacy risks (for example, preventing system prompt leaks) or reputational risks (for example, enforcing brand aligned model behavior)., You can set up guardrails that address risks youâ€™ve already identi(cid:8)ed for your use case and layer, in additional ones as you uncover new vulnerabilities. Guardrails are a critical component of any LLM-based deployment, but should be coupled with robust authentication and authorization protocols, strict access controls, and standard software security measures.
