Creating physical and temporal spaces for motherhood.

This enables a postpartum mother to have the place and time to engage

in motherhood-related responsibilities. For example, encouraging

ﬂexible work hours, providing access to lactation spaces that are high-

pumping equipment, and comfortable seating), structuring breaks that

allow for pumping, and encouraging work-family boundaries.

Validating the worker identity. This aﬃrms the mother’s professional identity and signals that her

contributions are valued. For example, celebrating a postpartum
