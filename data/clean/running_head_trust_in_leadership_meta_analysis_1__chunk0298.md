## Ethical Leadership The demonstration of normatively appropriate

conduct through personal actions and interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of such conduct to followers through two-way communication, reinforcement, and decision- making.

Theorised link to trust

Authentic leaders build benevolence and integrity by encouraging open communication, engaging their followers, sharing critical information, and sharing their perceptions and feelings. This form of individualised concern and respect should build trust through positive SEs. Further, high moral standards, integrity, and honesty, should fosters positive expectations among followers, enhancing their levels of trust.

Servant leaders are concerned with the betterment of their followers. For instance, a servant leader encourages followers to plan for future opportunities, is willing to delegate responsibilities and share authority with followers. When followers feel that they are receiving such benefits from the servant leader, they should be motivated to trust their leader.

Ethical leadersâ€™ fair treatment, consistent behaviour, and clear communication likely result in trust from followers. Such behaviours signal SE behaviours that are likely to promote positive interactions and reciprocity from followers. Further it is argued that ethical leaders are likely to inspire trust in followers as ethical behaviour signals these leaders take an interest in issues beyond themselves, rather than being egotistical.
