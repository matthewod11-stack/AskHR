## and Loewenstein, Bazerman and Thompson, 1989).

Sensible models of this type face a difficult challenge: Sometimes people sacrifice to increase payoffs of

others, and sometimes they sacrifice to lower the payoffs of others. The challenge is to endogenize when the

weights placed on payoffs of others switch from positive to negative. A breakthrough paper is Rabin’s (1993),

based on psychological game theory, which includes beliefs as a source of utility. In Rabin’s approach, players

form a judgment of kindness or meanness of another player, based on whether the other player’s action gives

the belief-forming player less or more than a reference point (which can depend on history, culture, etc.).

Players prefer to reciprocate in opposite directions, acting kindly toward others who are kind, and acting meanly

toward others who are mean. As a result, in a coordination game like “chicken”, there is an equilibrium in

which both players expect to treat each other well, and they actually do (since doing so gives higher utility, but

less money). But there is another equilibrium in which players expect each other to act meanly, and they also

do. Rabin’s model shows the thin line between love and hate. Falk and Fischbacher (2005) and Dufwenberg and

Kirchsteiger (2004) extend it to extensive-form games, which is conceptually challenging.

A different approach is to assume that players have an unobserved type (depending on their social

preferences), and their utilities depend on their types and how types are perceived (e.g., Levine, 1998 and

Rotemberg, 2004). These models are more technically challenging but can explain some stylized facts.

Simpler models put aside judgments of kindness based on intentions, and just assume that people care

about both money and inequity, either measured by absolute payoff deviations (Fehr and Schmidt, 1999) or by

the deviation between earnings shares and equal shares (Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000). Charness and Rabin

10

(2002) introduce a “Rawlsitarian” model in which people care about their own payoff, the minimum payoff

(Rawlsian) and the total payoff (utilitarian). In all these models, self-interest emerges as a special case when the

weight on one’s own payoff swamps the weights on other terms.

These models are not an attempt to invent a special utility function for each game. They are precisely the

opposite. The challenge is to show that the same general utility function, up to parameter values, can explain a

wide variety of data that vary across games and institutional changes (e.g., Fischbacher, Fong and Fehr, 2003).

Bayesian statistical judgment: The idea that people’s intuitive judgments of probability obey statistical

principles, and Bayes’ rule, is used in many applied microeconomics models (e.g., in games of asymmetric

information). Tversky and Kahneman (see Kahneman, 2003) used deviations between intuitive judgments and

normative principles (“biases”) to suggest heuristic principles of probability judgment. Their approach is

explicitly inspired by theories of perception, which use optical illusions to suggest principles of vision (Tversky

and Kahneman, 1982), without implying that everyday visual perception is badly maladaptive. Similarly,

heuristics for judging probability (like availability of examples, and representativeness of samples to underlying

processes) are not necessarily maladaptive. The point of studying biases is just to illuminate the heuristics they

reveal, not to indict human judgment. Thus, their original view is consistent with the critique that heuristics can

be ecologically rational.

The Bayesian approach is so simple and useful that is has taken some time to craft equally simple formal

alternatives which are consistent with the heuristics Kahneman and Tversky suggested. An appealing way to do

is to use the Bayesian framework but assume that people misspecify or misapply it in some way. Rabin and

Schrag (1999) give a useful model of “confirmation bias”. They define confirmation bias as the tendency to

overperceive data as more consistent with a prior hypothesis than they truly are. The model is fully Bayesian

except for the mistake in encoding of data. Rabin (2002) models representativeness as the (mistaken)

expectation that samples are drawn without replacement, and shows some fresh implications of that model (e.g,

11

perceiving more skill among managers than truly exists). Barberis, Shleifer and Vishny (1998) show how a

similar misperception among stock investors, that corporate earnings which actually follow a random walk

either exhibit momentum or mean-reversion, can generate short-term underreaction (“earnings drift”) and long-
