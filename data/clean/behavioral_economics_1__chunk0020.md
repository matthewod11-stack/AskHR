Choice over time: If choices are dynamically consistent, then the discount weight put on future utilities

must be exponential (u(xt)=δt). While dynamic consistency is normatively appealing, it seems to be contradicted

by everyday behavior like procrastination and succumbing to temptations created by previous choices.9 To

understand these phenomena, Laibson (1997) borrowed a two-piece discounting function from work on

intergenerational preference. His specification puts a weight of 1 on immediate rewards, and weights u(xt)=βδt

on rewards at future times t. This “quasi-hyperbolic” form is a close approximation to the mountains of

evidence that animal and human discount functions are hyperbolic, d(t)=1/(1+kt), and is easy to work with

analytically. (Rubinstein, 2003 suggests an alternative based on temporal similarity.) The β-δ model has been

calibrated to explain regularities in aggregate savings and borrowing patterns (Angeletos, Laibson, Tobacman,

2001), and applied to the study of procrastination and deadlines by O’Donoghue and Rabin (2001).

Self-interest: The idea that people only care about their own monetary or goods payoffs is not a central

tenet of rational choice theory, but it is a common simplifying assumption. Economists also tend to be skeptical

that people will sacrifice to express a concern for the payoffs of others. As Stigler (1981) wrote, “when self-

interest and ethical values with wide verbal allegiance are in conflict, much of the time, most if the time in fact,

self-interest theory…will win.”

Despite skepticism like Stigler’s, there is a long history of models that attempt to formalize when people

trade off their own payoffs for payoffs of others (e.g., Edgeworth, 1881; “equity theory” in social psychology;
