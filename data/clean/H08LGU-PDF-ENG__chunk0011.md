## Ruchika T. Malhotra, author of Inclusion on Purpose. “Actions most

often change as a result of intentionally designed processes. For

example, designing a more equitable hiring process actually beneﬁts

people of all backgrounds. But if people are resistant to the word

‘equitable,’ it shouldn’t stop leaders from designing for better hiring

outcomes using the same principles.”
