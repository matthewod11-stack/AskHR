# problem.

Have you met resistance from middle managers? Do they feel

threatened by AI’s capabilities?

We’ve made great strides, but we still have a percentage of people who are

resistant. I would like to think I’ve created a safe space for people to explain

why. Rather than have them hide it, it gives me the opportunity to speak to

them about their fears. I tell them that AI can’t do one of the most critical

aspects of their job. They know how to speak to our clients. They can read

between the lines, and help others articulate a problem, and explain what

they need to solve it. These are human-centric conversations AI can’t have

today. And they were conversations middle managers seldom had time to

have before.
