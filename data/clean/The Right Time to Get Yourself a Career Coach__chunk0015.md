Hi, Erna. I got your contact from Mark Dupont. I’m lookingfor some help with my career. I feel stuck in my job and I’mnot sure if my decision to get into creative services was theright one. When I accepted the job, I believed this area wasmy strength, but as time goes by, I feel I’m more suited tobusiness development and winning the contract for theteam, not actually doing the creative work. I’m looking forsome guidance, and I’d love to chat with you aboutpotentially working together. Do you have some time thisweek? Thank you. Best regards, Priya.

Don’t just go with the first person who responds. Even the coachwas referred, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to be a fit.It’s okay to have a few conversations and decide who you’d like towork with and who you can trust. Most coaching engagementswill last many months and making that journey with somebodyyou feel comfortable with is important. Here are some practicalquestions you might ask coaches when you interview them.

What is your coaching expertise? Have you worked withyoung professionals before? Make sure your coach hasexperience and/or certiﬁcations and can share some successstories. Expect the more experienced coaches to be pricier.

What is your coaching style? Coaches use diﬀerentapproaches, and some might match your needs better thanothers. Do you prefer a more action-oriented coach or a coachwho will require you to be more introspective?

Will the sessions be online or face to face? Some people feelmore comfortable interacting online than face to face.Understand what type of interactions you prefer, as well as theﬂexibility of the coach.
