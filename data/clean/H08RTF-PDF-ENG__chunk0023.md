# tough times.”

. . .

The past few years have taught us a couple things: It’s not reasonable to

expect employees (or yourself) to check their emotions at the door when

they come into work, and simply spending money on interventions like wellness apps isn’t suﬃcient on its own to support them. As a leader,

taking a more holistic view of your employees’ mental health—and

working through and sharing your own experiences—can make them

feel more engaged and improve the health of your organization.
