# output modalities.

- Memory Management: This includes short-term working memory for immediate context,

cache, and sessions . It also can include long-term storage for learned patterns and

experiences, as episodes, examples, skills or reference data. It also includes “reflection”

to decide which short term items (eg: user preference) should be copied into long term

memory (eg: user profile), and if that can be shared across agents, tasks, or sessions.

- Cognitive Functionality: This is often underpinned by Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct,

reasoning, thinking, or a planner subsystem - it allows agents to decompose complex

tasks into logical steps and engage in self-correction. In some cases this also includes

user intent refinement, to ask a clarifying question if uncertain.

- Tool Integration: This subsystem enables agents to utilize external tools, expanding

their capabilities beyond natural language processing. Dynamic tool registries allowing
