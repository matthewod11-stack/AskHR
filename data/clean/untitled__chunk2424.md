## The 1950s: Social Ferment and the Incubation of Community Psychology

Theconventionalviewamongpsychologistsisthatthefound- ing of the ﬁeld of community psychology was a “’60s phe- nomenon.”Accordingly, the turbulence of this decade roused citizens and professionals to believe that communities were important sources of well-being and that mental health ser- vices should be directed at the level of the community rather than at the level of the individual (Reiff, 1971). In contrast, the 1950s are often perceived as peaceful times, relatively free from turmoil.Against this myth, we contend that cultural and historical events in the 1950s created a sensitivity and consciousness about injustices that provided the basis for more direct attacks on social issues 10 years later.To this end, Halberstam (1993) identiﬁed the 1950s as a source of change.

“Social ferment . . . was beginning just beneath the placid sur- face” (p. ix). Events of the 1950s foreshadowed future issues of social dislocation, discontent, and unrest (Gitlin, 1987). Moreover,accordingtoKennedy(1999),“Thesocialandeco- nomic upheavals of wartime laid the groundwork for the civil rights movement as well as for an eventual revolution in women’s status” (p. 857). These assertions testify to the sig- niﬁcance of the post-World War II 1950s as a major era of incubation for the future of community psychology.
