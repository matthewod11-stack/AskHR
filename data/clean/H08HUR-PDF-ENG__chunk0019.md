## HBR / Digital Article / 10 Signs of a Toxic Boss — and How to Protect Yourself

and energy in hobbies, relationships, and goals outside of work can help

maintain perspective and reduce the impact of work-related stress.

Journaling has also been shown to be an eﬀective method to manage

emotions. In fact, writing about negative experiences has a positive

eﬀect on our mental health. Expressive writing, for example, can result

in a reduction in stress and anxiety, and can even bring us greater focus

and clarity. Set aside a few minutes each day to write freely about your

emotions and experiences at work. Use prompts like “Today I felt…” or

“A situation that aﬀected me was…” to explore your feelings.

Mindfulness can also help, and can be practiced in many ways,

including using techniques like meditation or deep-breathing exercises

to stay grounded and manage stress. This can help you remain calm in diﬃcult situations. A good place to start would be with the 4-7-8 exercise

where you breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and

then breathe out for 8 seconds.

- 2. Seek constructive dialogue.

If you feel you can talk to your boss, attempt to have calm, professional

conversation about how their behavior makes you feel. It’s important

to be factual. State speciﬁc examples, link them to your feelings, and

talk about how it undermined your ability to do the work asked of you.

Don’t be accusatory or apportion blame. Simply and calmly state how

their actions made you feel. It’s important to remain in control of your

feelings, and also to make note of anything they may say, in case you

need to take the issue further.

Instead of saying: “You signaled that you don’t value me when you

passed me over for the new client’s project and said I couldn’t handle

competing priorities. It crushed my conﬁdence. I knew I could do

it, but it seems you didn’t trust me enough. You also point out my

mistakes in front of everyone, making me appear careless.”
