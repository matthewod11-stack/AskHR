For example, with my value of freedom, there are many ways todefine it. Here is how I define it versus how one of my clientsdefines it:

My deﬁnition: Ability to do whatever I want, whenever I want,and however I want it. This applies at the macro level (e.g.,travel) and micro level (e.g., mental freedom).

My client’s deﬁnition: I want to have independence in myactions and decision-making and not be micromanaged.Same value, but two very different definitions.At first, you may be tempted to write long paragraphs for each ofyour values to justify or explain them. But try to keep yourdefinition as short as possible — you want to be able to easilyremember your values and how you define them. Just onesuccinct sentence will do.
