## conversations, and potentially contentious interactions so you can

schedule time to prepare and reset.

. . .

Not every emotionally charged moment comes with a warning—to be

sure, some take you by surprise. But when you do see one ahead, eﬀective preparation makes all the diﬀerence. By visualizing success,

focusing on the positives, deliberately modifying the situation, and building in buﬀer zones, you will navigate fraught meetings more

conﬁdently and successfully. Leadership will always involve some

intense interactions, but with the right strategies, you can turn them

into deﬁning moments that drive real progress.
