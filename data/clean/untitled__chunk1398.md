# The Case of Locus of Control

Furby and Baistow both recognize several main features of concepts articulated through notions of internal psychologi- cal control, such as locus of control, level of aspiration, learned helplessness, and self-efﬁcacy. First, emphases on in- ternal control reﬂect the discipline’s class-based interests in “maintaining a prevailing control ideology that is as internal as possible” (Furby, p. 180) and contributed to a fashioning of a “self-management subject” (Baistow). Second, emphases on self-determinism ﬁt well with prevailing Protestant ethic beliefs in the value of internal control, an integral ingredient of capitalist ideology. Third, while for Furby this promulga- tion of a self-determining subject indicates a repressive role of psychology’s social control interventions, Baistow takes this one step further to show a more productive potential of psychology’s self-control ideologies. Drawing on Nikolas Rose’s (1992) extension of Foucauldian analysis to psychol- ogy, Baistow (2000) shows how, for example, increased senses of internality could eventuate in challenges to the sta- tus quo, such as black civil rights protests and the rise of black militancy. In these cases, increasingly widespread notions of locus of control introduced as solutions to problems of disad- vantaged groups may have helped to make possible empow- erment talk, now “commonplace in political rhetoric in the USAand the UK in recent years and a seemingly paradoxical objective of government policy and professional activities” (p. 112). Contrary, then, to being overly individualized and locus of depoliticized psychological notions of control,

control discourses became instead politicized through their use in collective action to transform being powerless into empowerment (Baistow, 2000).
