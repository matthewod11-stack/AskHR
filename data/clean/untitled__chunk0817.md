# Models of the Nature of Intelligence

some of these common elements might be. For example, they might include understanding the problems and responding to them.

Theory of Connections. Thorndike, Bregman, Cobb, and Woodyard (1926) proposed a quite similar theory, based on Thorndike’s theory of learning. They suggested that

in their deeper nature the higher forms of intellectual operations are identical with mere association or connection forming, de- pending upon the same sort of physiological connections but requiring many more of them. By the same argument the person whose intellect is greater or higher or better than that of another person differs from him in the last analysis in having, not a new sort of physiological process, but simply a larger number of con- nections of the ordinary sort. (p. 415)

According to this theory, then, learned connections, similar to Thomson’s bonds, are what underlie individual differences in intelligence.
