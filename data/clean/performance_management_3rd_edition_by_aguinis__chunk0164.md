# 1.4.3 Short-Term Incentives

Similar to contingent pay, short-term incentives are allocated based on past performance. However, incentives are not added to the base pay and are only temporary pay adjust- ments based on the review period (e.g., quarterly or annual). Incentives are one-time payments and are sometimes referred to as variable pay.

A second difference between incentives and contingent pay is that incentives are known in advance. For example, a salesperson in a pharmaceutical company knows that if she meets her sales quota, she will receive a $3,000 bonus at the end of the quar- ter. She also knows that if she exceeds her sales quota by 10%, her bonus will be $6,000. By contrast, in the case of contingent pay, in most cases, the specific value of the reward is not known in advance.
