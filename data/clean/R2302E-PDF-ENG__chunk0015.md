# escape that trap.

Question the assumption that hierarchy is ﬁxed. Yes, most companies

have—and need—an organizational chart with job titles and reporting

requirements that spell out who has the authority to make key

decisions. But savvy leaders know that the messy and ever-evolving

nature of organizational life means it’s unwise—if not impossible—to

keep the same pecking order in the organization at all times.

Members of the best teams don’t treat rules and roles like a

musical composition that’s played exactly as written. Instead, like jazz

musicians, they improvise, trying new things and constantly making

adjustments in response to one another’s moves, while still being

guided—and often constrained—by the original theme. Jazz bands

routinely rotate leadership, giving each player a chance to have a solo

or develop a musical idea while others play a supporting role. This

ability to support another musician is known as comping—listening and

responding without overshadowing—and it’s one reason jazz players are

so respected by other musicians.
