# Summary Points

- The first step in measuring performance by adopting a results approach is to iden- tify accountabilities. Accountabilities are the various areas in which an individual is expected to focus.

- After all key accountabilities have been identified, the second step in the results

approach is to set objectives for each. Objectives should be (1) specific and clear, (2) challenging, (3) agreed upon, (4) significant, (5) prioritized, (6) bound by time, (7) achievable, (8) fully com- municated, (9) flexible, and (10) limited in number.

- Finally, the third step in the results approach involves determining per- formance standards. These yardsticks are designed to help people understand to what extent the objective has been achieved. In creating standards, we must consider the dimensions of quality, quantity, and time. Good standards are (1) related to the position; (2) concrete, specific, and measurable; (3) practical to measure; (4) meaningful; (5) realistic and achievable; and (6) reviewed regularly. â€¢ The first step in measuring performance adopting a behavior approach involves identifying competencies. Competencies are measurable clusters of KSAs that are critical in determining how results will be achieved. Examples of competencies are customer service, written or oral communication, creative thinking, and dependability.

- The second step in the behavior approach involves identifying indica- tors that will allow us to understand the extent to which each individual possesses the competency in question. These indicators are behavioral mani- festations of the underlying (unobserv- able) competency.

- In describing a competency, one must first clearly define it, then describe behavioral indicators showing the pres- ence of the competency, describe behav- ioral indicators showing the absence of the competency, and list suggestions for developing the competency.

- After the indicators have been identi- fied, the third step in the behavior approach includes choosing an appro- priate measurement system, either comparative or absolute.

- Comparative systems base the measure- ment on comparing employees with one another and include simple rank order, alternation rank order, paired
