This low level of reliability probably results from the point cited earlier that a reference writer has not seen all aspects of an applicant’s behavior. Thus, a reference provided by a professor who has observed an applicant in a classroom may not agree with a reference provided by a supervisor who has observed the same applicant in a work setting. Although there may be good reasons for the low levels of reliability in reference letters that limit their validity, research has yet to answer this question: If two references do not agree, which one should be taken the most seriously?

Extraneous Factors. The fourth problem with letters of recommendation concerns extraneous factors that affect their writing and evaluation. Research has indicated that the method used by the letter writer is often more important than the actual content. For example, Knouse (), but not Loher, Hazer, Tsai, Tilton, and James (), found that letters that contained specific examples were rated higher than letters that contained generalities. Mehrabian () and Weins, Jackson, Manaugh, and Matarazzo () found that even though most letters of recom- mendation are positive, letters written by references who like applicants are lon- ger than those written by references who do not. This is important because Loher and colleagues () found that the longer the recommendation letter, the more positively the letter was perceived.

A promising approach to increasing the validity of references is to increase the structure of the reference check. This can be done by conducting a job analy- sis and then creating a reference checklist that is tied directly to the job analysis results. When such a process is used, research has demonstrated higher levels of predictability (McCarthy & Goffin, ; Taylor, Pajo, Cheung, & Stringfield, ; Zimmerman, Triana, & Barrick, ).

As this discussion illustrates, references and letters of recommendation often are not great predictors of performance. But with further refinement and research, techniques such as the trait approach or increased structure may increase the predictive abilities of references.
