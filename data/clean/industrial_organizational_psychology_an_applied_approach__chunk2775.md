# Leader Performance

In contrast to leader emergence, which deals with the likelihood that a person will become a leader, leader performance involves the idea that leaders who per- form well possess certain characteristics that poorly performing leaders do not. For example, an excellent leader might be intelligent, assertive, friendly, and independent, whereas a poor leader might be shy, aloof, and calm. Research on the relationship between personal characteristics and leader performance has concentrated on three areas: traits, needs, and orientation.

Traits As shown in Table ., a meta-analysis by Judge et al. () found that extra- version, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were positively related to leader performance and that neuroticism was negatively related to leader performance. A meta-analysis by Youngjohn and Woehr () also found that management, decision-making, and oral-communication skills were highly correlated with leadership effectiveness.

As was the case with leader emergence, high self-monitors tend to be better leaders than do low self-monitors (Day & Schleicher, ; Day et al., ). The concept of self-monitoring is especially interesting, as it focuses on what leaders do as opposed to what they are. For example, a high self-monitoring leader may possess the trait of shyness and not truly want to communicate with other people. She knows, however, that talking to others is an important part of her job, so she says hello to her employees when she arrives at work, and at least once a day stops and talks with each employee. Thus, our leader has the trait of shyness but adapts

her outward behavior to appear to be outgoing and confident. To determine your level of self-monitoring, complete Section A in Exercise . in your workbook.

An interesting extension of the trait theory of leader performance suggests that certain traits are necessary requirements for leadership excellence but that they do not guarantee it (Simonton, ). Instead, leadership excellence is a function of the right person being in the right place at the right time. The fact that one person with certain traits becomes an excellent leader while another with the same traits flounders may be no more than the result of timing and chance.

For example, Lyndon Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr. were considered successful leaders because of their strong influence on improving civil rights. Other people prior to the s had had the same thoughts, ambitions, and skills as King and Johnson, yet they had not become successful civil rights leaders, perhaps because the time had not been right.

Cognitive Ability A meta-analysis of  studies by Judge et al. () found a moderate but signifi- cant correlation (r = .) between cognitive ability and leadership performance. The meta-analysis further discovered that cognitive ability is most important when the leader is not distracted by stressful situations and when the leader uses a more directive leadership style. In studies investigating the performance of U.S. presidents, it was found that the presidents rated by historians as being the most successful were smart and open to experience, had high goals, and interestingly, had the ability to bend the truth (Dingfelder, ; Rubenzer & Faschingbauer, ). Sternberg () has expanded on the importance of cognitive ability by theorizing that the key to effective leadership is the synthesis of three variables: wisdom, intelligence (academic and practical), and creativity.

Needs A personal characteristic that has received some support pertains to a leader’s need for power, need for achievement, and need for affiliation. In fact, as shown in Table ., a meta-analysis by Argus and Zajack () found a sig- nificant relationship between need for achievement and leader performance. Research by McClelland and Burnham () and McClelland and Boyatzis () demonstrates that high-performance managers have a leadership motive pattern, which is a high need for power and a low need for affiliation. The need is not for personal power but for organizational power.

This pattern of needs is thought to be important because it implies that an effective leader should be concerned more with results than with being liked. Leaders who need to be liked by their subordinates will have a tough time mak- ing decisions. A decision to make employees work overtime, for example, may be necessary for the organization’s survival, but it will probably be unpopular with employees. Leaders with high affiliation needs may decide that being liked is more important than being successful, causing conflict with their decision.

This theory would also explain why internal promotions often do not work. Consider, for example, a person who worked for six years as a loan officer. He and ten coworkers often went drinking together after work and went away on weekends. One day he was promoted to manager, and he had to lead the same people with whom he had been friends. The friendships and his need to be liked hindered the new manager when giving orders and disciplining his employees. When he tried to separate himself from his friends, he was quickly thought of as being “too good” for them—a tough situation with no apparent solution, according to this theory.

This does not mean that a leader should not be friendly and care about sub- ordinates. But successful leaders will not place their need to be liked above the goals of the organization. President Richard Nixon was thought to have a high need to be liked. He would often make a tough decision and then apologize for it because he wanted to be liked by both the public and the press.

Needs for power, achievement, and affiliation can be measured through various psychological tests. The most commonly used is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). The TAT is a projective test in which a person is shown a series of pictures and asked to tell a story about what is happening in each. A trained psychologist then analyzes the stories, identifying the needs themes contained within them. Obviously, this technique is time-consuming and requires a great deal of training. Another commonly used measure is the Job Choice Exercise (JCE), developed by Stahl and Harrell (). With the JCE, the person reads descriptions of jobs that involve varying degrees of power, achievement, and affiliation needs and rates how desirable he finds each particular job. These ratings are then subjected to a complicated scoring procedure that uses regression analysis to reveal scores on the three needs categories. To find your own need- for- achievement, need-for- power, and need-for-affiliation levels, complete Section D of Exercise . in your workbook.

Another method to determine leaders’ needs is to examine the themes that occur in their writing and speeches. In one interesting use of this method, it was found that Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Kennedy, and Reagan had high needs for power; Presidents Harding, Truman, and Nixon had high needs for affiliation; and Presidents Wilson, Hoover, and Carter had high needs for achievement (Winter, ).

Gender As with leader emergence, meta-analyses suggest that the role of gender in leader effectiveness is complex. When all studies are combined, men and women appear not to differ in leadership effectiveness (Eagly, Karau, & Makhijani, ). How- ever, men were more effective as leaders in situations traditionally defined in masculine terms and in situations in which the majority of subordinates were men. Women were more effective as leaders in situations traditionally defined in less masculine terms. Though men and women appear to be equally effective leaders, a meta-analysis of leadership styles indicated that women were more likely than men to engage in behaviors associated with high-quality leadership (Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen, ).

Task Versus Person Orientation Over the last  years, three major schools of thought—Ohio State Studies (Fleishman, Harris, & Burtt, ), Theory X (McGregor, ), and Managerial Grid (Blake & Mouton, )—have postulated that differences in leader performance can be attributed to differences in the extent to which leaders are task versus person oriented. As shown in Figure ., though the three schools of thought use different terms, they say similar things.

Person-oriented leaders such as country club leaders, Theory Y leaders, and leaders high in consideration act in a warm and supportive manner and show concern for their subordinates. Person-oriented leaders believe that employees are intrinsically motivated, seek responsibility, are self-controlled, and do not necessarily dislike work. Because of these assumptions, person-oriented lead- ers consult their subordinates before making decisions, praise their work, ask
