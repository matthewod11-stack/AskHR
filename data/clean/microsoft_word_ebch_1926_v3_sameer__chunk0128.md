ABSTRACT:

The public and private sectors, performance appraisal plays a significant role in the overall operations of human resource management. Employee motivation is greatly impacted by performance reviews.For example, if employees believe it would negatively impact their next pay rise, they are less likely to want to be honest about work challenges or disclose that they need more training. This study aimed to ascertain the impact of performance appraisal systems on worker productivity in Kenya's Kiambu County water and sewerage corporations. The study's goals were to ascertain the relationship between evaluation feedback and employee productivity as well as the effects of appraisal criteria, methodologies, and feedback on employee productivity. The resource-based view theory, goal-setting theory, and expectancy theory served as the study's foundations.The following departments were chosen for the study's target participants human resources, finance, information technology, technical assistance, and customer service. Department leaders, section heads, and supervisors were among the responses.
