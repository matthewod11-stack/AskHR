# What Would Be a Big Three?

Findings from most lexical studies to date suggest the general rule that if three factors are extracted and rotated, these factors tend to be broad versions of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Consci- entiousness, the ﬁrst three factors from the Big Five (Saucier & Goldberg, 2001). All lexical studies that have identiﬁed the Big Five in ﬁve-factor solutions and also report the character of the three- factor solution report this Big Three. Moreover, some studies that did not straightforwardly replicate the Big Five did replicate this lexical Big Three (Di Blas & Forzi, 1998, 1999; De Raad & Szirmák, 1994; Hahn, Lee, & Ashton, 1999), so it appears more robust than the Big Five. And the Big Three (like the one- and two-factor so- lutions already described) seem relatively unaffected by how wide versus narrow a variable selection one employs (Saucier, 1997).

However, at least two lexical studies have not replicated this Big Three in three-factor solutions, these being the studies in French
