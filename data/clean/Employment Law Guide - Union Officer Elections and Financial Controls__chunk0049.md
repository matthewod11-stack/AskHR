# period).

If the organization went out of existence during its ﬁscal year, a terminal ﬁnancial report must be ﬁled within 30

days after the date it ceased to exist. A terminal ﬁnancial report must be ﬁled if the labor organization has

gone out of business by disbanding, merging into another organization, or being merged and consolidated

with one or more labor organizations to form a new labor organization. The last president and treasurer, or the

oﬃcials responsible for winding up the aﬀairs of the labor organization, must ﬁle a terminal ﬁnancial report for the period from the beginning of the ﬁscal year to the date of termination. A terminal ﬁnancial report is not

required if the labor organization changed its aﬃliation but continues to function as a separate reporting labor

organization. In addition to initial and semiannual trusteeship reports, the organization imposing the

trusteeship is required to ﬁle an annual ﬁnancial report on Form LM-2 on behalf of the trusteed organization.

The Form LM-2 is due within 90 days after the end of the trusteed organization's ﬁscal year and must report the ﬁnancial activities of the entire ﬁscal year. If the trusteeship was imposed during the subordinate labor

organization's ﬁscal year, the ﬁrst report must cover the period prior to the imposition of the trusteeship as

well as the ﬁnancial transactions occurring during the trusteeship. A terminal trusteeship ﬁnancial report on

Form LM-2 is also required within 90 days after the date that the trusteeship is terminated.

Any Form LM-2 ﬁled on behalf of a trusteed organization must include the signatures of the trustees, in addition to the signatures of the president and treasurer or corresponding principal oﬃcers of the organization

which established the trusteeship.

Form LM-3 (Financial report). Labor organizations with total annual receipts of less than $250,000 may ﬁle

the simpliﬁed annual report Form LM-3, if not in trusteeship. Labor organizations with greater annual total receipts and those in trusteeship must ﬁle the more detailed Form LM-2.
