## your sabbatical through thoughtful preparation.

To start, you may not need to quit your company. Many organizations

without formal sabbatical policies are still willing to make exceptions

for their most valued employees — if they’re intrepid enough to ask.

Less attractive options can also work for both parties, including taking

unpaid leave, departing without a guaranteed position on return, or

compromising on a later departure date to better ﬁt business realities.

If you’re worried about retribution for appearing less serious about

your job, ask colleagues if they know of anyone who has taken leave
