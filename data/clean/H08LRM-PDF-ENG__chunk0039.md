## for self-renewal. A survey I conducted among Harvard Business School

graduates 10 years out found that more than one-third had already

taken a sabbatical, and more than 90% of those who hadn’t taken time

oﬀ viewed extended leave-takers in a positive or neutral light.

One of the best ways to alleviate this worry is to ﬁnd an exemplar:

someone you admire who has taken a successful sabbatical. This makes

it easier to envision yourself taking one. If no one immediately comes

to mind, ask around, search your LinkedIn connections for those taking

advantage of its “career break” designation, or post in dedicated forums
