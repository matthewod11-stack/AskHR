# The State of the Science

Over roughly the past two decades, careful academic studies exploring

the eﬃcacy of a blind hiring approach have been undertaken across

Europe, Canada, and the U.S. In these studies, researchers have

compared the proportions of job applicants from disadvantaged groups

who are selected for interviews — at organizations in both the public

and private sectors — when application materials are blinded or

evaluated in the normal fashion. Generally (but not entirely), these

studies have found that more applicants from disadvantaged groups

advance to the interview stage when a blind hiring approach is used.

In one study in the public sector in Sweden, researchers found

that more women and ethnic minorities were selected for interviews

when their applications were anonymized versus when names were

maintained. Another study in the Swedish public sector found that

women who uploaded their credential information to a database used

by potential employers were more likely to receive interview invites

when their gender information was blinded. And in the Netherlands,

researchers found that people of non-Western origin, who represent a

traditionally disadvantaged, Dutch job-seeker group, were more likely
