# Conclusion

We have sought to trace the multiple processes through which per- sonality may inﬂuence the occurrence of counterproductive be- haviors. Our central thesis has been that there are many ways in which personality traits may exert their causal inﬂuence in relation to these behaviors. In particular, we have argued that personality traits may exert their causal inﬂuence by initiating, both directly and indirectly, the occurrence of counterproductive behaviors and by moderating the relationship between organizational events and perceptions of job satisfaction, stress, and injustice and these per- ceptions and counterproductive behaviors.

As we mentioned at the outset, this chapter is part of an ongo- ing effort within personality psychology to understand the causal paths between personality and behavior generally. As such, the chapter is necessarily preliminary, provisional, and incomplete. It is our hope that we have sparked the interest of researchers inter- ested in the linkages between personality and counterproductive behaviors and provided direction for future research in this area.
