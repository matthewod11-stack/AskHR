# An Integrated Model of Job Performance

The taxonomies reviewed in the previous section can be integrated into a single taxonomy that can be used to link speciﬁc personal- ity constructs to speciﬁc performance constructs. The taxonomy is hierarchical but is not a latent variable model such as would be tested using factor analysis. Consistent with other conceptualiza- tions of performance (for example, Motowidlo et al., 1997), this taxonomy is an aggregate model. The performance components at the higher levels are aggregate multidimensional constructs, or mathematical functions of the lower-order dimensions. This means that the dimensions assigned to the same higher-order dimension are not necessarily highly correlated with each other. For example, non-job-speciﬁc task proﬁciency refers to performance on tasks that may be performed in many jobs within an organization (for example, planning and organizing, making decisions, and using computers; Johnson, 2001). These tasks may have little in common with each other, but the aggregate of performance on all of these tasks represents a meaningful construct.

Table 4.1 contains the taxonomy, which has three components at the highest level: task performance, citizenship performance,
