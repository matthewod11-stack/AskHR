# beneﬁciaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing beneﬁts and defraying reasonable expenses of

administering the plan. In discharging their duties, ﬁduciaries must act prudently and in accordance with documents governing the plan, to the extent such documents are consistent with ERISA.

ERISA prohibits certain transactions between an employee beneﬁt plan and "parties in interest," which include

the employer and others who may be in a position to exercise improper inﬂuence over the plan, and such

transactions may trigger civil monetary penalties under Title I of ERISA. The Internal Revenue Code ("Code")

also prohibits most of these transactions, and it imposes an excise tax on "disqualiﬁed persons" (whose deﬁnition generally parallels that of parties in interest) who participate in such transactions.

Exemptions. Both ERISA and the Code contain various statutory exemptions from the prohibited transaction

rules and give the Departments of Labor and Treasury, respectively, authority to grant administrative

exemptions and establish exemption procedures. Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 transferred the

Department of Treasury's authority over prohibited transaction exemptions to the Department of Labor, with certain exceptions.

The statutory exemptions generally include loans to participants, the provision of services needed to operate a

plan for reasonable compensation, loans to employee stock ownership plans, and investment with certain

ﬁnancial institutions regulated by other state or Federal agencies. (See ERISA Section 408 for the conditions

of the exemptions.) The Department of Labor may grant administrative exemptions on a class or individual basis for a wide variety of proposed transactions with a plan. Applications for individual exemptions must
