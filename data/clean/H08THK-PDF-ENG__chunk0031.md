## email, a formal document, a social post, or something else.

First, determine the purpose of what you’re writing. What result do

you want to achieve? Are you looking to inform, persuade, or make

a request? Let that purpose inform the substance and style of your

communication from beginning to end.

Then, identify exactly who your audience is and speak directly to them.

This means using language that they understand and a voice that

resonates with them. It also means anticipating and answering their

questions—before they need to ask.
