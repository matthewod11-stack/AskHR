## Construct Issues: Different Referents and Definitions of Trust in Leadership

Past research has demonstrated a diversity in construct focus. In this section, we examine two issues regarding the construct of trust in leadership. As suggested by Clark and Payne (1997), the con- struct of trust has two independent facets: the referent of the trust in leadership and the definition of trust in leadership. In other words, in responding to a survey, the follower is asked to assess a particular referent on a particular dimension. We use the theoret- ical framework described earlier to examine how a focus on a particular referent or a particular definition of trust affects the primary relationships between trust and other variables. We dis- cuss hypotheses only for those relationships for which we have both sufficient data and a theoretical rationale.

Attributes of the relationship. The length of a relationship between individuals may affect the level of trust between them. For example, the level of trust may be greater in a relationship of long duration than in a relationship of short duration owing to the level of knowledge and familiarity acquired. Lewicki and Bunker (1996) suggested that deeper levels of trust develop over time, largely as a function of the parties having a history of interaction. Length of a relationship is one proxy for the extent of interaction. As a counterpoint, an individual may over time recognize that trust in a leader is not warranted. In sum, it is unclear whether length in relationship will be related to trust in leadership.

Hypothesis 2: Trust in leadership will be positively related to transformational leadership, perceived organizational sup- port, interactional justice, transactional leadership, procedural justice, PDM, distributive justice, propensity to trust, and length of relationship and will be negatively related to unmet expectations.
