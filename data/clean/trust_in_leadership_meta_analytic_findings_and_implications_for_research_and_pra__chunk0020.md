We have classified satisfaction with leader and leader–member exchange (LMX) as correlates of trust in leadership. Trust in leadership and satisfaction with leader are conceptually similar because they both reflect an attitude or assessment that individuals hold about the same referent: the leader. Given the similarity, we expect the two variables to covary at a high level with no distinct direction of causality.

The relationship between trust and LMX is particularly com- plex. Some research has conceptually or empirically separated LMX from trust in leadership (e.g., Cunningham & MacGregor, 2000; Lagace, 1987); other studies have treated it as a subdimen- sion of LMX (for a review, see Schriesheim et al., 1999). Brower, Schoorman, and Tan (2000) suggest that LMX comprises two trust constructs that do necessarily have to be “balanced” or recipro- cated: the leader’s trust in subordinate and the subordinate’s trust in leader. Given the complex relationship that remains a point of
