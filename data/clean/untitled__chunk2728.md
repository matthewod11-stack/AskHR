## A. TOY CALDWELL-COLBERTAND VELMA M. WILLIAMS

Nearly a half century ago, the sociopolitical climate of the civil rights movement set the stage for changes and the need to work differently with people of color. In the 1950s and 1960s the public at large came to realize that race, skin color, oppression, segregation, and discrimination issues cut across society and impacted ethnic groups in various ways. Political activists and peoples’ cries for help raised public conscious- ness to the realities of racism and oppression and their role in dealing with the problems of everyday living for people of color in the United States.

Serious attention by psychologists to diversity issues began in 1973 during the Vail Conference (H. F. Myers, Echemendia, & Trimble, 1991). The recognition of a need for change was stepped up a notch when the 1977 Presi- dent’s Commission on Mental Health’s Special Populations Task Force (1978) concluded that culturally different indi- viduals were clearly underserved or inappropriately served by the mental health system in this country. Yet in 1994, the Center for Mental Health Services in Rockville, Maryland, reported a bleak ratio of 3 to 1 of ethnic minorities needing mental health services to available minority professionals. According to Wohlford (1992), active minority mental health professionals were around 8.8% of approximately 148,579 active mental health service providers in the United States.

H. F. Myers et al. (1991) very poignantly summarized the situation, “Given the present state of professional training,

the average new PhD in psychology is only slightly more competent to meet the mental health needs of our culturally diverse population than are psychologists who completed training 20 years ago” (Casas, 1995, p. 311).

Two events in the last decade had a leading impact on psy- chology and on the preparation of all psychologists to work with ethnic minority clients, not only new students to the ﬁeld, but also those trained 20 years ago. First, the American Psychological Association’s endorsement of the August 1990 Guidelines for Providers of Psychological Services to Ethnic, Linguistic, and Culturally Diverse Populations; and, second, the National Institutes of Health issuance in 1994 of guide- lines requiring representation of women and ethnic minori- ties in research in order to receive funding.

The signiﬁcance of the APA Guidelines was documented by surveys mailed to 500 randomly selected psychologists in the fall of 1986 and again in the spring of 1992 (Caldwell- Colbert, 1998). An increase in people responding from 1986 to 1992 suggested a heightened awareness to the importance of therapy with the ethnically diverse.

Despite the apparent awareness of the needs, there were only slight changes in the number of adult clients seen when looked at by ethnic group. Except for Native Americans and Asian Americans, the reported percentages of clients treated decreased for all other ethnic groups in 1992. Native American clients treated increased from 2% to 3% and Asian Americans clients treated stayed the same at 2%.
