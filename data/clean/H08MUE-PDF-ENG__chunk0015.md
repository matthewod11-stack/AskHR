## HBR / Digital Article / The Pandemic Proved That Remote Leadership Works

With geography no longer a limitation, organizations can look almost

anywhere to ﬁnd the best leaders for the job, broadening the applicant

pool signiﬁcantly. And recruiters can approach talented people who

otherwise might turn down an opportunity that requires relocation—

critical for star leaders who may have excellent alternatives.

This shift is also hugely beneﬁcial to leaders themselves as they manage

their careers and lives. As the head of a retained executive search ﬁrm

noted, many executives “no longer want to move for work,” but rather

prefer to maintain roots in a community and avoid disrupting their

families. Perhaps that is why recent surveys have shown that 68% of

“bosses” (middle managers, functional leaders, executives) would like to

continue working remotely.
