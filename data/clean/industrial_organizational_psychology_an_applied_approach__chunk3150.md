# Least acceptable result

Negotiating territory

An important influence on the outcome of a negotiation is what is called the best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA). A BATNA is the best alter- native that negotiators have if they can’t reach an agreement. For example, if I am buying a car and I already have an offer of $, from one dealer (my BATNA), my least acceptable result when I negotiate with a new dealer will be less than the $,. If the dealer won’t go lower, I can walk away knowing I already have a better deal. If the dealer is aware of my BATNA, it will reduce his initial offer because he knows that an initial offer greater than my BATNA will not be effec- tive (Buelens & Van Poucke, ).

Seitz and Modica () have suggested four indicators that tell when nego-

tiations are coming to an end so that each side can prepare its final offer:

. The number of counterarguments is reduced. . The positions of the two sides appear closer together. . The other side talks about final arrangements. . The other side appears willing to begin putting things in writing.

Although this conflict resolution strategy appears to be the best approach to take, it often is not. Sometimes, compromise results in a bad solution. For exam- ple, if Congress wants to include $ million in the federal budget to construct a new nuclear power plant and the president wants to budget only $ million, then the two are likely to agree on a median figure such as $ million. But if the project cannot be completed for less than $ million, then the compromise may waste millions of dollars that could be spent elsewhere.

Determining Confl ict Styles A person’s method of dealing with conflict at work can be measured by the Rahim Organizational Conflict Inventory II (Rahim & Magner, ) or the Cohen Con- flict Response Inventory (Cohen, ). To determine your own conflict style, complete Exercise . in your workbook.

Resolving Conﬂ ict Prior to Confl ict Occurring An organization should have a formal policy on how conflict is to be handled. Usually such a policy will state that employees should first try to resolve their own conflicts, and if that is not successful, they can utilize a third-party interven- tion. Employees should receive training on the causes of conflict, ways to prevent conflict, and strategies for resolving conflict. For example, at the Timken plant in Alta Vista, Virginia, all employees received  hours of training on how to resolve conflicts, which included role plays to practice what they learned. Similarly, the City of Plano, Texas, offers employees an optional -hour training program in conflict mediation and facilitation.

When Confl ict First Occurs When conflict first occurs between coworkers or between a supervisor and a subordinate, the two parties should be encouraged to use the conflict resolu- tion skills they learned in training to resolve the conflict on their own. These skills include expressing a desire for cooperation, offering compliments, avoid- ing negative interaction, emphasizing mutual similarities, and pointing out common goals. A key to resolving conflict is to reduce tension and increase trust between the two parties. This can be accomplished by stating an intention

to reduce tension, publicly announcing what steps will be taken to reduce ten- sion, inviting the other side also to take action to reduce tension, and making sure that each initiative offered is unambiguous. By taking these steps early on, minor conflict can be resolved quickly, and serious conflict can be resolved through negotiation.

The two parties meet in a private location to address the problem—prior to this meeting, the two parties should not talk to others about the problem. When the two parties actually do sit down together, the employee who arranged the meeting explains his perception of the problem, when it occurred, and the impact that it has had on him (e.g., anxiety, anger, depression, lower productivity). For example, an employee might say, “When you made fun of my accent at lunch last week, it made me feel that you were putting me down and didn’t respect me.” Or an employee might tell a supervisor, “When the promotion was given to John instead of me, I thought it was because he is a male and I am a female.” It is important that the employee address the behavior of the other person rather than such aspects as the person’s values, personality, and ability. For example, an employee would not want to say, “You demonstrated what a racist you are by giv- ing the promotion to Henry instead of me.” In other words, the focus should not be on who an employee is but rather what he has done.

The second party then responds to what was said by the first party. If the second party agrees, he might apologize and then agree to stop the behavior. If the second party doesn’t agree, she would explain her perception of what hap- pened. The two parties would then exchange views and suggestions until they have reached an agreement on how to resolve the issue. If the two can’t agree, the conflict is labeled a dispute, and the parties should seek third-party intervention (Lulofs & Cahn, ).

An interesting aspect of this idea is called cooperative problem solving. An example of this approach is when the president of an organization forms a task force or committee with representatives from all of the departments or divisions that will be affected by the solution. Together these representatives work to define the problem, identify possible solutions, and arrive at the best one.

This process doesn’t always go smoothly, but it is important that employees try to resolve their own conflicts before seeking help from a third party. Employees who resolve their own conflicts are more likely to buy into a resolution than employees who use a third party. Furthermore, bringing in a supervisor makes it more difficult for employees to admit that they have done something wrong. Of course, employees should not be forced to try to resolve all conflicts on their own. When emotions are high, alcohol or drugs are involved, or one party feels threat- ened by the other, a third-party intervention is in order.

Third-Party Intervention If conflict cannot be resolved by the parties involved, it is often a good idea to seek help—that is, to ask for third-party intervention. This third party usually is provided through mediation, and if that doesn’t work, through arbitration. Mediation. With mediation, a neutral third party is asked to help both parties reach a mutually agreeable solution to the conflict. Mediators are not there to make decisions. Instead, their role is to facilitate the communication process by providing the parties with a safe and equitable venue so that they are more willing and able to reach a solution. Mediators can be employees of the organi- zation (e.g., team leader, supervisor, human resource manager) or professional

mediators who work with a variety of organizations. Mediators are most success- ful when two parties do not trust one another (Ross & Wieland, ), and they provide the best results when both sides consider the mediator to be competent and trustworthy. For mediation to be successful, both parties must agree that there is a conflict and that a solution can be found by working together.

Mediation has been effective in resolving even the most difficult conflicts. For example, in , % of the employment discrimination claims that were sent to mediation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission were resolved. Furthermore, the mediation process took  days—substantially less time than did the typical lawsuit. Interestingly, % of charging parties were willing to accept mediation, yet only % of employees agreed to mediation (Clark, ).

According to Lovenheim and Guerin (), mediation is better than filing
