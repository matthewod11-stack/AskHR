Contribution by the Researcher The study discovered a link between a toxic workplace culture, which is defined by high levels of rudeness, bullying, and abusive management, and poor results for employees' mental health, including melancholy and anxiety. These detrimental effects may damage an employee's relationships and personal life in addition to their employment. According to the study, an encouraging workplace culture significantly affects the mental health and general wellbeing of employees. Positive mental health outcomes were more likely to be reported by employees who felt supported by their coworkers and managers, had a sense of belonging, and felt that their work was meaningful. According to this research, encouraging employees to take calculated risks, think creatively, and seek out learning opportunities at work may benefit their mental health and general wellbeing. A sense of autonomy, mastery, and purpose, all of which are crucial for fostering better mental health outcomes, may be fostered in innovative workplace cultures. It has been demonstrated that toxic workplace cultures, which are characterized by rudeness, bullying, and abusive behaviour, significantly affect employee churn. Workers who encounter these unfavourable behaviours are more likely to quit their jobs, either voluntarily or as a result of being fired without cause, which can result in high turnover rates for the company. As employees are more likely to feel valued and involved in their work, a pleasant workplace culture can result in better levels of employee retention. Increased job satisfaction, motivation, and company loyalty may result from this. Employees are less likely to quit their job and look for work elsewhere
