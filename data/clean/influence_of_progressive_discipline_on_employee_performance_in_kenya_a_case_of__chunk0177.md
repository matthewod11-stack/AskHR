The study adopted the inferential statistical analysis. The tests of significance to be used are multiple regression analysis expected to yield the coefficient of determination (R2), t – tests, z – tests and p – values. The choice of these techniques was guided by the variables, sample

size and the research design and multiple regression model at 5% level of significance to establish the strength and direction of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The employee performance was four independent variables. The equation was expressed as follows: Y= β0+ β1X1+β2X2+ β3X3+ β4X4+ ε, Where; Y= E(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ee perfor(cid:373)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e, β(cid:1004)= constant (coefficient of intercept); X1= Employee reprimand system; X2= Codes of conduct; X3= Employee disciplinary measures; X4= Employee rules and regulations; ε = error ter(cid:373); β(cid:1005)…β(cid:1008)= regression coefficient of four variables.
