They ﬁrst lay out the stages linking immediate mood states with judgments and pro- cessing outcomes. Working from the “affect as information” ap- proach, they propose the key stages of reaction, attention (to affective states or reactions), and attribution (for affective states or reactions). They then propose a classiﬁcation of individual differ- ence measures relevant to these stages and organize relevant ex- isting trait measures into their classiﬁcatory scheme. The program has the virtue of tying personality directly to process and the added advantage of using personality moderator predictions as a way of testing the validity of process.
