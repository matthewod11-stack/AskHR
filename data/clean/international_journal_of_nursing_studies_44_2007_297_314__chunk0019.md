Job satisfaction is considered within empirical studies either as an overall (global) feeling about the job, or as a related set of attitudes about various aspects of the job (facet approach) (Spector, 1997). The global approach to measurement is used when the interest is in overall attitude to the job. However, facet approaches can determine which particular aspects of the job are producing satisfaction or dissatisfaction for therefore, important in determining areas for improvement. Facets of job satisfaction can involve any aspect of the job and those frequently assessed include pay, co-workers, super- visors, organisational factors and work environment (Smith et al., 1969; Stamps and Piedmonte, 1986).
