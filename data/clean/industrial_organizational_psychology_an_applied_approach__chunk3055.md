best networks depend on the situations and goals of their groups. For example, if the goals of fraternities and singles clubs are to encourage members to get to know one another, then a centralized structure will be less conducive than a completely open one. Conversely, if the goal of a group is to solve a problem as quickly as possi- ble, then the centralized network will be the best structure. A good leader carefully chooses the communication network that best facilitates the goals of his group.
