Think like a coach. These discussions tend to be straightforward with

high-performing employees, but for those not performing at their best

says that while you must “avoid making your employees feel penalized

or held accountable for things they don’t have any control over,” it’s

crucial to address their mistakes.

Mondal suggests adopting the approach of a football coach debrieﬁng

with a player after a challenging game played in bad weather. The player

might complain about the snow and the slippery ﬁeld, she says. “And as

a coach you need to say, ‘Yes, the conditions were tough. Here are three

things you did well during the game, and here are two things you could

have done better.’” By acknowledging what they did right under the

circumstances, but also where they can improve, you strike a balance

between recognition and constructive criticism. And remember: “If a

she says.

deal with an employee who’s consistently underperformed over the

year depends on many factors, including the nature of the job,

the employees’ capabilities, their willingness to improve, and your

bandwidth to support them and get back on track.
