Prolonged eye contact is the norm in Arabic cultures, but it shows a lack of respect in many African, Latin American, and Caribbean countries. Touching another person is common in Latin and Middle Eastern countries, but not in northern European or Asian countries.

Research has shown that body language can affect employee behavior. For example, a meta-analysis by Barrick, Shaffer, and DeGrassi () found that the use of appropriate nonverbal communication is highly correlated with interview scores.

Though body language can be a useful source of information, it is important to understand that the same nonverbal cue can mean different things in different situations and cultures. So, be careful and try not to read too much into a par- ticular nonverbal cue.

Use of Space. The ways people make use of space also provides nonverbal cues about their feelings and personality. Dominant people or those who have authority are given more space by others and at the same time take space from others. For example, people stand farther away from such status figures as executives and police officers (and even college professors), and stand in an office doorway rather than directly enter such a person’s office. These same status figures, however, often move closer as a show of power. Police officers are taught that moving in close is one method of intimidating a person.

On the other hand, status figures also increase space to establish differences between themselves and the people with whom they are dealing. A common form of this use of distance is for an executive to place a desk between herself and another person. An interesting story is told by a sports agent who was negotiat- ing a player’s contract with George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees. When the agent arrived at Steinbrenner’s office, he noticed that Steinbrenner sat at one end of a long desk. At the other end was a small chair in which the agent was to sit. Recognizing the spatial arrangement to be a power play, the agent moved his chair next to Steinbrenner’s. As the story goes, the Yankee owner was so rattled by this ploy that the agent was able to negotiate an excellent contract for his player client.

The following example also illustrates how the use of space can enhance a person’s status by adding an image of importance. Recently, the psychology build- ing at Radford University was renovated, and with efficient use of attic space, every faculty member was given an office. Students who visited during office hours had been accustomed to faculty members sharing offices. Many of these students commented on how important the psychology faculty member they had come to see must be to receive his/her own office. (Of course, we never told them that we all had our own offices and that faculty members in other departments would also soon have their own.)

Four major spatial distance zones in the United States have been recognized and defined (Hall, ): intimacy, personal distance, social distance, and public distance.

The intimacy zone extends from physical contact to  inches away from a person and is usually reserved for close relationships such as dates, spouses, and family. When this zone is entered by strangers in crowded elevators and the like, we generally feel uncomfortable and nervous. The personal distance zone ranges from  inches to  feet away from a person and is the distance usually reserved for friends and acquaintances. The social distance zone is from  to  feet away

and is the distance typically observed when dealing with businesspeople and strangers. Finally, the public distance zone ranges from  to  feet away and is characteristic of such large group interactions as lectures and seminars.

The way an office is furnished also communicates a lot about that person. As mentioned earlier, certain desk placements indicate openness and power; visitors and subordinates prefer not to sit before a desk that serves as a barrier (Davis, ). People whose offices are untidy are perceived as being busy, and people whose offices contain plants are perceived as being caring and concerned.

Use of Time. The way people make use of time is another element of nonverbal communication. If an employee is supposed to meet with a supervisor at : and the supervisor shows up at :, the supervisor is communicating an atti- tude about the employee, the importance of the meeting, or both. Tardiness is more readily accepted from a higher-status person than from a lower-status person. Dean Smith, the great former basketball coach at the University of North Carolina, suspended any player who was even a minute late for a practice because he believed that tardiness was a sign of arrogance and worked against the team concept.

In a similar fashion, a supervisor sets aside  minutes for a meeting and tells others that she is not to be disturbed because she is in conference. A definitive message thus is conveyed, one that is likely to prevent constant inter- ruptions by telephone calls or people stopping by to say hello because they saw an open door.

Care must be taken when considering how others use time, as there are tremendous cultural differences in such things as being late and keeping to time schedules. For example, punctuality is important in the United States, Austria, Canada, and Japan, but not a priority in Brazil, France, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia (Olofsson, ).

Paralanguage Paralanguage involves the way we say things and consists of variables such as tone, tempo, volume, number and duration of pauses, and rate of speech. A message that is spoken quickly will be perceived differently from one that is spoken slowly. In fact, research has shown that people with fast speech rates are perceived as more intelligent, friendly, and enthusiastic (Hecht & LaFrance, ) than people with slow rates of speech. People who use many “uh-hums,” “ers,” and “ahs” are also considered less intelligent. Men with high- pitched voices are considered to be weak, but women with high-pitched voices are considered to be petite. People telling lies talk less, provide fewer details, repeat words and phrases more often, have more uncertainty and vocal ten- sion in their voice, and speak in a higher pitch than do people telling the truth (DePaulo et al., ).

Simple changes in the tone used to communicate a message can change the entire meaning of the message. To demonstrate this point, consider this sentence: “I didn’t say Bill stole your car.” At first reading, it does not seem unusual, but what does it actually mean? As Figure . shows, if we emphasize the first word, I, the implication is that someone else said, “Bill stole your car.” But if we empha- size the word Bill, the meaning changes to “Someone else stole your car.” And so on. Thus, a simple written message can be interpreted in seven different ways. As you can see, many messages are better communicated orally than through memos or email.
