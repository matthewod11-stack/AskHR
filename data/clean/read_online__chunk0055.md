# Stress and engagement

The Subjective Job Stress Scale (SJSS) was used to measure individual job stress (Motowidlo, Packard & Manning 1986). This scale included Likert-type scale items that sampled responses ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’. The alpha for this scale was 0.80. The Employment Engagement Survey (Wilson 2009) was utilised to measure employee engagement. These items have demonstrated reliability in Wilson’s previous study, with an alpha of 0.77. The alpha found for this study is 0.80.
