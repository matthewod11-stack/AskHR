## HBR / Magazine Article / Revitalizing Culture in the World of Hybrid Work

“I ﬁnd it ironic when leaders say they need to bring workers back to

the oﬃce because of culture,” says Alexia Cambon, a research director

in Gartner’s HR practice and a principal author of the study. “They’re

going to get the opposite of what they hope for. Instead of viewing

hybrid work as a disruption to the cultural experience, leaders should see it as an opportunity to build culture diﬀerently.”

Culture can be evaluated on the basis of two components, Cambon

explains: alignment (meaning that employees know what the culture

is and believe that it is right for the ﬁrm) and connectedness (they

identify with and care about the culture). A Gartner survey of more

than 4,500 knowledge workers and 200 HR leaders showed that in-

oﬃce mandates drove connectedness sharply down. Among employees

with “radical ﬂexibility” (deﬁned as considerable freedom over location,

schedule, work volume, team, and projects), 53% reported a high degree

of connectedness, whereas just 18% of those with low ﬂexibility did so.

That’s important, the research shows, because more-connected workers

perform at a higher level than others (by as much as 37%) and are

36% more likely to stay with the organization. In another Gartner

survey, half of knowledge workers said they would jump ship if their

company rescinded their Covid-era ﬂexibility. “Some CEOs may think

that workers will grumble a bit but eventually habituate to a full-time

return,” Cambon says. “Without a sense of connectedness, though, they

have nothing to stop them from going to a less-rigid company.”

Before the pandemic, ﬁrms tended to focus their culture-building eﬀorts on alignment, trusting that connectedness would occur more or

less by osmosis. “Leaders hoped that the way oﬃces were designed and

decorated and the frequent interactions among workers would foster

an emotional connection with the organization,” Cambon says. That

approach had limitations even before the pandemic, she adds, and it is
