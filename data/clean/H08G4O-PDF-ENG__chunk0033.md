# execution.

One investor shared, “By deﬁnition, founder CEOs have built something

from nothing and have been successful at it. This can create positive

bias. As a result, they frequently overestimate what is feasible. Other

CEOs may not think big enough; they see budgets as way too aggressive,

while the founder CEO will say, ‘We can do much more than that.’”
