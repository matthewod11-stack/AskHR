# 4.2 Gradient Boosting

Gradient boosting is a dynamic algorithm employed for both classification and regression tasks, facilitating the development of prediction algorithms. What distinguishes Gradient Boosting from the rest is its scalability and remarkable speed during deployment. In the setting of classification, gradient boosting functions sequentially, with every novel predictor learning from the errors made by preceding predictors. This repeated learning process enables swift classification and faster production of outcomes because of the algorithmâ€™s capability to learn from previous mistakes (Jain & Nayyar, 2018). The performance measure of the Gradient Boosting classifier is demonstrated in Figure 3 below, illustrating the evaluation of its effectiveness.
