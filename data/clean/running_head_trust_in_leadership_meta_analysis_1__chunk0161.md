## over-positive leadership styles (e.g., Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2018).

The focus of the primary studies involved in our sample led to some further limitations

and highlight important areas to be addressed by future empirical work in the area. First, the

nascent nature of some of the styles included in our meta-analysis, combined with the rarity

of studying multiple styles within a single empirical study, means it is not yet possible to

compare the influence of all styles within a single model. We recommend that scholars

investigating novel leadership styles include the role of established styles in their models to

determine issues of relative influence. In addition, an insufficient number of primary studies

were available for some of the leadership styles to meaningfully test the mediated

relationships for both cognitive and affective trust. As such, greater uptake of

multidimensional measures of trust are needed to help to tease out their differential roles. As

noted, many styles also have subdimensions that may logically be more related to cognitive

or affective forms of trust. As research often only reports on the overall style, it is not
