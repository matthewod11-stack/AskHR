## HBR / Digital Article / Maternity Leave Isn’t Enough to Retain New Moms

How will you know if you are successful?

What gets measured gets done. How do you know if you are retaining

mothers? Track how many return from leave (and don’t assume it’s

because they don’t want to work anymore). Measure how long they stay

out after their ﬁrst child and any subsequent children. Patagonia is a

great example of a company that focuses on this data and has strong

retention. It supports working mothers with policies such as onsite child

care and an organizational culture that embraces rather than ignores
