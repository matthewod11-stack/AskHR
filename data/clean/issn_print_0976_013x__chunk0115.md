processing unit. Also, the processing unit is engaged in extracting the pulp only. However, there

converting custard apple pulp into powder and sell the same on various online platforms. Thus,

a seasonal venture can be converted into a round-the-year enterprise for the tribal women.

For example, custard apple can also be used for making jam, fruit-flavoured yoghurt, fruit drinks

and syrups, with fruit extracts from custard apple (Hoyos, 1980), juices (Sinthiya and Poornima,
