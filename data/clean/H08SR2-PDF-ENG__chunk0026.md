## grateful to this senior leader for the help.

Building a culture of support

Our study also shows that employees, especially of large companies,

appreciate the opportunity to feel supported by, and to support,

leaders who often felt out of reach. For example, Margo described her

excitement about riding “with” her CEO: “We would let [a coworker]

know when I had my 500 ride. I was like, ‘Here’s the ride I’m going to

do.’ And to have the CEO do the ride with me was just incredible…We were all in diﬀerent departments, diﬀerent levels of the organization,

but found this commonality.”
