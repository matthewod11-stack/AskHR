## The strategy-du-jour CEO in the opening story of a tech ﬁrm hinders

performance because she changes course “at a moment’s notice,”

chasing new ideas before the last one gained traction. Early on, this

approach created buzz and energy. But over time, employees grew

frustrated with the constant whiplash. One month, the priority was

international expansion; the next it was pivoting to a new product—all

without clear reasons. Productivity gave way to chaos. As one former

team member noted, “the CEO hit a wall and so did the company.”

This is strategy fatigue at its most acute: talented people rendered

ineﬀective because leadership can’t stick to a direction long enough to

reach a successful ﬁnish line.
