## HBR / Digital Article / How to Prevent Strategy Fatigue

- A fashion company that keeps ﬂipﬂopping about its strategic

directionJennifer had been Senior Account Manager for a company

that sells high-end women’s fashion clothing, bags, and accessories.

She had been hired to “expand the business internationally via

wholesale” (B2B) and had identiﬁed a critical but complicated path to

make this happen. But after just two years she had left due to strategy

fatigue brought on by her CEO’s ﬂipﬂopping about corporate direction.

When I asked why the CEO kept changing course, Jennifer said she

“lacked a retail background, came from a large strategy consulting

ﬁrm, and didn’t have industry knowledge.” The CEO had trouble

staying on track with the plan and “changed the strategy every three

months,” switching from international expansion to extra focus on

retail (B2C), to opening more stores, to using a diﬀerent brand for a

certain product—to anything the board okayed. “The CEO was always

looking for a silver bullet to deliver unrealistic ﬁnancial results,”

Jennifer observed, none of which worked. In the end, the CEO was

ﬁred a year after Jennifer left.
