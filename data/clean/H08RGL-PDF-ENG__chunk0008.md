# What Is Unhelpful Help?

Unhelpful help occurs when givers oﬀer assistance that misses the

mark—because it’s poorly executed, not what was promised, or simply

not what the recipient needed. These failed attempts aren’t usually

malicious. In fact, they often stem from good intentions. But they can

still drain energy, slow down work, and erode trust.
