# discussions.

- If you trust your employee’s technical skills, try having them mentor a

newer team member or guide them through a complex task.

- If you trust your employee’s problem-solving abilities, try assigning

increasingly complex tasks or providing more autonomy in tackling

problems and coming up with their own solutions.

Focus on clear and frequent communication as you delegate and build

on their tasks and responsibilities. Communicate the purpose and

desired outcome of the task, your speciﬁc expectations and standards,

deadlines, and their level of authority in making task-related decisions.
