agent is ﬂexible and can deliver modules when the employee needs

them or skip over content when it’s not required.

R&D employees can use diﬀerent agents as assistants to help them

look at a given problem from an unusual perspective. Leo provided

a case where “an R&D employee facing a technological challenge can

choose multiple AI agents to help them with a technical explanation,

a fresh perspective, or instructions about how to tackle the problem

from a diﬀerent angle.” For example, an R&D employee facing a mining

technology problem can choose a software testing agent, a geology

agent, or a machinery agent to help them.

When selecting agents, R&D employees regularly asked themselves

which agents are most suitable in helping them with their type of

problem. So, Be Smarter decided to install a rating system for employees

to provide feedback on the usefulness of an AI agent for diﬀerent types
