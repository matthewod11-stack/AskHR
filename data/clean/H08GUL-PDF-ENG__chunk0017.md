## HBR / Digital Article / How 3 Companies Are Using AI to Mimic Expert Judgement

But crucially, the algorithms were based on observing the specialist’s

data processing decisions, not on rules provided by the specialist

themselves. That’s because people often aren’t all that great at

explaining how they make decisions. Rohan spelled out how this

works. “Instead of asking each specialist about their preferred ways

of treating, analyzing and interpreting satellite data to create a set

of recommendations, we monitored what each specialist actually did

with the diﬀerent data sets.” The analysis avatar started out with a

simple machine-learning based approach and continued to become

more complex as more data points about the specialists’ behavior were

collected.

Results: Today, the analysis avatars can mimic the data treatment

behavior of the company’s best remote sensing specialists to a level

of precision, recall, and accuracy that meets most simple application

demands. This has left the human specialists to focus on new or more

complicated tasks. Moreover, inexperienced remote sensing specialists

joining the company fresh from university can learn the company’s best

practices without distracting its human experts.

How to do it yourself: Look for existing AI platforms that enable AI

models to capture and replicate expert decision-making patterns

automatically through observation. Your ideal platform should support

continuous learning and real-time data processing. This will enable

your AI system to evolve as new data is gathered, thus making

intelligent decisions based on expert behavior without relying on

predeﬁned rules.
