The good news is you have more control over your career than you

might think. Here are ﬁve options to reignite your motivation at work—

no matter how remote you are.

Create your own mini performance review.

If you’ve been at your company for a while and have been through at

least one performance review cycle, now’s a good time to go back and

revisit it. In my work as a career coach, I’ve observed that most people

ﬁle away their reviews and only revisit them when the next one is due.

However, past conversations could hold clues about what you could be

doing right now to invest in your growth.

What themes came up in your last performance review? What are your

core strengths? What goals did you share in that conversation but

haven’t acted on? What constructive feedback did you receive?

Goals or suggestions from your last review can serve as a springboard

for thinking about speciﬁc, actionable goals to pursue in the next few

months. You can also reﬂect on any changes in your role, team, or the

company since that last performance conversation. In addition, if your

company has shifted priorities since your last review, consider what you

could explore to match those new needs.
