make up 36% of median CEO compensation.

→ Long-term incentives aren’t meaningful for CEOs at Asian companies. This is partly because some of the largest companies in China and Hong Kong are state-owned. At them compensation is regulated, base salaries and bonuses are not market-driven, and long-term incentives generally aren’t offered.

→ The median CEO base salary is 20% lower in the Americas than in Europe and Australia and meaningfully lower in Asia than in other regions.

→ The median total cash compensation (base salary plus annual bonus) of CEOs is 4% lower in Europe and Australia than in the Americas and is lowest in Asia.
