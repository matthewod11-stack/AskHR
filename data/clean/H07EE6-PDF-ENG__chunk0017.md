# Supervisor Deterrence

Many worker hotlines sit quiet because workers fear retaliation for

speaking out. Vulnerable workers often worry that their hours could

be docked, their wages reduced, or their position eliminated. This type

of direct retaliation is concerning, but our research uncovered another

way supervisors discourage (even unknowingly) workers from reporting

incidents: Many employers simply do nothing to address the concerns

that are raised, often because they fear that making changes will be too diﬃcult or costly to implement.

The MD program’s enforcement structure shakes farms out of this

status quo thinking. Employers receive a premium in exchange for

participation in the MD program; those who engage in or allow

retaliation against complainants face suspension from the program, and

loss of this premium. Furthermore, the MD program requires employers

to engage with and respond to all valid complaints — doing nothing

is not an option. As a result, farms develop a proactive approach to

complaint resolution, and become less resistant to change. The MD

hotline also rigorously protects complainant conﬁdentiality. Taken

together, these measures build employee trust, as workers see that

raising concerns can yield tangible improvements.
