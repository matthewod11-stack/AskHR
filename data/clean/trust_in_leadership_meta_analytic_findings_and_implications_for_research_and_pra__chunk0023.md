It is unclear whether these distinctions provide leverage for understanding how trust is created and how it operates. On one hand, distinctions between the definitions might not be meaning- ful, because all of the definitions may tap the same construct. On the other hand, the measures may be tapping somewhat different aspects of trust, each of which has a potentially unique relationship with other constructs. To date, research has provided almost no evidence on the implications of using alternative definitions.

We suggest that alternative operational definitions of trust result in relationships of different magnitude with other variables be- theoretical processes cause they are associated with different (relationship-based or character-based theory). Specifically, the character-based perspective seems to be logically associated with cognitive definitions of trust, the relationship-based perspective is logically associated with affective definitions, and both perspec- tives are likely to be relevant to some degree for overall definitions of trust. For example, cognitive items such as “I believe manage- ment has high integrity” and “[My leader] is not always honest and truthful” (Robinson, 1996) capture perceptions about the leader’s character that would create concerns about being vulnerable to him or her. In contrast, affective items such as “I would have to say that we have both made considerable emotional investments in our working relationships” and “If I shared my problems with [my leader] I know he would respond constructively and caringly” (McAllister, 1995) are likely to be indicators of a relationship that will operate beyond the standard economic contract and that in- volves the exchange of socioemotional benefits. The implications of these differences are discussed in the following two paragraphs. In the meta-analysis, we analyze the different relationships related to overall versus cognitive trust. We focus on these two types because we found that nearly all of the studies included in the meta-analysis used one of these two; there is presently insufficient data to directly examine affective trust.

Hypothesis 5: Interactional justice, procedural justice, and PDM will have a stronger relationship with trust in direct leaders than with trust in organizational leadership. Perceived organizational support will have a stronger relationship with trust in organizational leadership.

We begin with differential relationships with outcomes. The assumption that cognitive operationalizations are primarily asso- ciated with and operate by means of the character-based theory, affective definitions are primarily associated with and operate by
