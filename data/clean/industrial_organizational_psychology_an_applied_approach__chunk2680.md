Communication can be improved if we choose our words carefully and ask, “How might the other person interpret what I am about to say?” If I use the word girl, will anyone be upset? If so, what word could I use that would be better?

Communication Channel Problems in communication can occur as a result of the communication channel through which the message is transmitted. Information can be communicated in a variety of ways, such as orally, nonverbally, through a second party, or through a written medium such as a letter or memo. The same message can be interpreted in different ways based on the channel used to communicate it. For example, an employee being reprimanded will receive the message very differently if it is communicated in a memo or an email rather than face to face. A miffed employee who gives the cold shoulder to a coworker will receive a different response than if she yelled at the coworker or discussed the anger with her.

Another example of the channel’s importance is a supervisor criticizing an employee in front of other employees. The employee might be so embarrassed and angered that she would not hear the content of the message. Again, transmit- ting a message through an inappropriate channel interferes with the message’s meaning and accurate interpretation.

Often, the communication channel is the message itself. For example, if top management sends a “gofer” to deliver a message, it is essentially communicating that either the message or the receiver is not important. A colleague at another university tells about a former boss who always personally delivered good news (e.g., promotions, raises) as well as doughnuts on Friday. But lower-level manage- ment always had to communicate the bad news, a practice that was resented by employees.

Perhaps the worst choice of a communication channel occurred in , when Radio Shack emailed  of its workers in their Fort Worth, Texas, headquarters that they would be losing their jobs. Even worse than the choice of communication channel was the actual wording of the communication, “the work force reduction notification is currently in progress. Unfortunately your position is one that has been eliminated.” Employees were given boxes and plastic bags to pack their personal belongings and given  minutes to leave. What message do you think this sent to the employees?

Noise The noise surrounding a transmission channel can also affect the way a message is received. Noise can be defined as any interference that affects proper reception of a message. An obvious example is actual auditory noise, such as the sound of a subway or elevated train interfering with conversation. Other examples are the appropriateness of the channel, the reputation of the person sending the mes- sage, and other information being received at the same time.

Nonverbal Cues Much of what we communicate is conveyed by nonverbal means. Our words often say one thing, but our actions say another. For example, a supervisor may tell an employee that she is interested in hearing her opinions, while at the same time she is frowning and looking out the window. The verbal message from the super- visor may be “I care,” but the nonverbal message is “I’m bored.” Which message will the employee pay attention to? Most likely, it will be the nonverbal one, even

though nonverbal cues often lead to incorrect impressions. Nonverbal cues can be divided into five categories: body language, paralanguage, use of space, use of time, and artifacts.

Body Language. How we move and position our body—our body language—com- municates much to other people. For example:

When one’s body faces another person, it is often interpreted as a sign of liking, whereas when a person’s body is turned away from another, it is often interpreted as a sign of dislike or lack of interest. Superiority is communicated by interrupting others, leaning back in a chair, moving closer to someone, or sitting while others stand. Making eye contact implies interest. In a casual conversation, increased eye contact is interpreted as a sign of liking, in a bar it may be a sign of flirting, and on a football field it may be interpreted as a sign of aggression. Lack of eye contact can mean many things, including disinterest, discomfort, or embarrassment. A person who makes eye contact while speaking but not while listening is often perceived as being powerful or dominant. Raising or lowering the head or the shoulders may indicate superiority or inferiority, respectively. Touching someone usually indicates liking, friendship, or nurturance. In fact, a review of several studies indicated that servers who touch their customers will receive a larger tip than those who do not (Azar, ). Another study found that library clerks who briefly touched patrons as they were being handed books were rated by the patrons as being better employees than clerks who did not touch (Fisher, Rytting, & Heslin, ). Men initiate contact more often than women (Major, Schmidlin, & Williams, ). A meta-analysis by DePaulo et al. () found that when people lie, they are more likely to purse their lips, raise their chin, fidget, and show nervousness than when they are not telling a lie.

As one might expect, gender differences occur in the use of nonverbal cues. For example, Dolin and Booth-Butterfield () found that women use nonver- bal cues such as head nodding to show attention more often than do men. In social situations, women touch, smile, and make eye contact more than men do (DePaulo, ).

Not surprisingly, there are many cultural differences in nonverbal communi-

cation. Here are a few examples:

In the United States, a thumbs-up indicates agreement. In Australia, it is considered a rude gesture. In Japan, bowing is preferred to shaking hands. In the United States, people point at objects with their index finger. Germans point with their little finger, and Japanese point with the entire hand. In Japan and the Middle East, pointing with your index finger is considered rude. Showing the soles of one’s feet is common in the United States but is considered offensive in Thailand and Saudi Arabia. Sitting with one’s legs crossed shows relaxation in the United States but is considered offensive in Ghana and Turkey.
