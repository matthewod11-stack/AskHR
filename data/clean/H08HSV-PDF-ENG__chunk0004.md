# Pause

Instead of charging ahead, take a beat. Set aside 15 to 30 minutes in your

week to ask yourself the following questions:

- How long have I had these standards in place?

- Are they in line with the company’s goals and needs?

- When did I last consider how I’m measuring success for the current

situation? Do I need to recalibrate?

- Have I ever discussed these standards with my team? (It’s not

uncommon for leaders to have incredibly high standards…which

they’ve never communicated.)
