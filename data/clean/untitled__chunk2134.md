# Psychological Forces

Psychological forces are developments in thought, theories, research, and practice in psychology generally. I-O psychol- ogy can trace its roots to the inception of psychology as a discipline at the end of the nineteenth century, the period de- scribed as the ﬂowering of science (Roback, 1952). The intel- lectual zeitgeist consisted of positivism, materialism, and empiricism; consequently, scientists became interested in em- pirically investigating the mind and behavior. In his Germany laboratory, Wilhelm Wundt used the experimental method to control observations for studying objectively mind and be- havior in order to separate psychology from philosophy as a scientiﬁc discipline (Hergenhahn, 1997).

During this time, functionalism, which is based on Darwinism and individual differences, was formulated. This school of thought emphasized the importance of adaptations, functions, and ﬁtness as keys to survival (Angell, 1907). Psy- chologists became interested in how and why the mind adapts the individual to its environment. Functionalism served as the foundation for the mental-testing movement that took place at the turn of the twentieth century and the birth of a second

psychology, or applied psychology. In addition to functional- ism and the mental-testing movement, great emphasis was placed on empirical methods because psychologists felt com- pelled to legitimize their science and to address society’s skepticism of the profession. Industrial psychology evolved from these developments in psychology (see Goodwin, 1999, or Hergenhahn, 1997, for a lengthier discussion of the devel- opment of American psychology).

ConnectionsareapparentbetweenI-Opsychologyandpsy- chology perspectives such as behaviorism, neobehaviorism, gestalt, humanistic, and cognitive psychology. Behaviorism was a catalyst for conducting objective studies of behavior, developing practical applications, and including environmen- tal or situational variables in theories of work behavior. For example, I-O theorists identiﬁed behaviors and situational conditions for effective leadership and developed behavioral measures for evaluating performance. One manifestation of Skinner’s neobehaviorism was organizational behavior modi- ﬁcation (Katzell & Austin, 1992). Similarities exist between the systems view of organizations and gestalt theory. The humanistic perspective inspired theorists and researchers to consider self-actualization and noneconomic motivators in the workplace. Lord and Maher (1991) described several developments in I-O psychology derived from the cognitive revolution. For example, cognitive theory has helped I-O psy- chologists understand cognitive processes in evaluating per- formance and designing jobs. Further exploration of the links between psychology and I-O psychology is needed.
