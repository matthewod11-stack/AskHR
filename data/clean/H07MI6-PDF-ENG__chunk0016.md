# HBR / Digital Article / 6 Key Levers of a Successful Organizational Transformation

organization,” as Dr. Patrick Liew, executive chairman at GEX Ventures,

told us.

In our interviews, leaders spoke of working on their own development,

including engaging more with their emotions and becoming

accustomed to the discomfort that accompanies personal growth.

Leaders needed to “look into a mirror,” as one told us, and realize that

they were part of the problem before the shift to a positive trajectory

could take place. They needed to remove their own fear before they

could help their employees get through this change.

“As someone who was tasked to lead this [transformation], if I’m being

honest with you, it was pretty unsettling at the start, because I think by

nature most of us like to know the path we’re going on,” as one COO

from the automative industry told us. And a senior vice president in

the global business services industry described needing to become more

vulnerable and honest on their path to self-discovery: “I think I became

even more aware of myself, who I am.”

- 2. A shared vision of success

Creating a uniﬁed vision of future success is another all-important

foundation point of a transformation. In our research, 50% of

respondents involved in successful transformations said the vision

energized and inspired them to go the extra mile to a signiﬁcant extent

(as compared 29% of respondents in low-performing transformations).

Employees must understand the urgent need to disrupt the status quo.

A compelling “why” can help them navigate the inevitable challenges

that will arise during a transformation program. Many of the workers

who took our survey said that they “wanted” and “needed” the vision

to be communicated clearly. When leaders share a clear vision, the

workforce is more likely to get on board. But if people don’t understand

the vision or need for transformation, success is hard to achieve.
