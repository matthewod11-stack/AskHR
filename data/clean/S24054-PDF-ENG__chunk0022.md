## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

In his leadership style, Coach Belichick never got too close to his

players. He wasn’t one to mingle and form personal relationships with players or coaches, because it’s diﬃcult to do that when you know

you’ll have to trade, cut, or ﬁre most of them at some point down the

road. So I often took the opposite approach: I tried to get to know

my teammates deeply and show that I cared about them personally.

I asked about their families and the things going on in their lives

oﬀ the ﬁeld. I made it clear that if we connected as teammates,

they’d be my teammates for life, and I’ve tried to live up to that. My

relationships are the most important thing in my life. I like to think my

style complemented Coach Belichick’s. I was lucky to play for a coach

who was so smart, hardworking, and focused on discipline—a coach

who relentlessly held people accountable for doing their job. He was

fortunate to have someone like me who could recognize where the team

was at emotionally, rally the troops, and pull people together.
