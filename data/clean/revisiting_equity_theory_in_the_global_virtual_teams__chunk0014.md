The following considerations are made to support the following hypotheses. It should be noted that all three propositions were initially laid out by Huseman et al. (1987) t al. (1987) near

and our objective is to empirically test them in the context of GVTs. As Huseman e pointed out, Benevolents’ perceptions of equity and job satisfaction have a negative, li relationship. Accordingly, we propose:

H1.

There is a negative, linear relationship between Benevolents’ perceptions of equity and job satisfaction in GVTs.

H2.

There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between Equity Sensitives’ perceptions of equity and job satisfaction in GVTs.

Finally, for Huseman et al. (1987), there is a positive, linear relationship betw perceptions of equity and job satisfaction in GVTs. Accordingly, we propose:
