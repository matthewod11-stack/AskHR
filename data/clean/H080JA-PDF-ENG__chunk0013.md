## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Redefine Our Gendered Idea of “Ambition”

of development, even when employees have to prioritize ﬂexibility in

the short term, as women so often have to do. In these companies,

opportunities to advance are not ultimatums.

For example, at one Fortune 100 company we support, a senior

executive remained at a middle-management level for eight years while

she was raising her children. Yet the experience she built over this

period gave her deep expertise, relationships, and conﬁdence that led

to rapid advancement when the time was right. Her acceleration came

when she was ready, but her pace did not cost her the opportunity to

grow. She now often tells others that her being able to ﬂex in this way

was critical for both her career and her family.

Rather than penalizing women for lacking stamina or drive, savvy

companies recognize how systemic barriers (such as gendered divisions

of labor at home) can overwhelm women at key moments in their

careers. These companies aﬀord women a sense of agency about when

to accelerate and don’t force them to drive at the same speeds as their
