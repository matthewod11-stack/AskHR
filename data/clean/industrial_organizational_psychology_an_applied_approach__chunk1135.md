# Example 2:

In Example 1, the first figure, the cube, is correct. You should have darkened the answer space above the first figure. In Example 2, all of the figures are correct in shape, but only one of them is shaded correctly. The last figure is correct.

Remember the surfaces you are shown in the pattern must always be the outside of the folded figure.

When the signal is given turn the page over and begin. Work as quickly and as carefully as you can.

NOTE: If you change an answer, mark a heavy “X” on the answer you wish to change then darken the correct answer.
