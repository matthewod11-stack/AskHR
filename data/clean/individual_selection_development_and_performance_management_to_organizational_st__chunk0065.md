# Developing Competency Models to Promote Integrated Human Resource Practices â€¢ 323

Occupational information allows HR to bring useful information and data to the decision- making process, while reducing the risk of le- gal challenges for their organization.

The federal government, as well as many other organizations, must be able to more quickly adapt to changes. OPM will continue to leverage technology and improve method- ology to ensure the competency models re- main current and applicable and that these models are quickly distributed. By building partnerships with the public and private sec-

tors, OPM will work to ensure a common lan- guage for describing jobs. OPM will continue to provide data to support national initiatives. Although many organizations will probably never conduct the large-scale occupational analyses that OPM does, organizations can build on the publicly available competency models developed by OPM. OPM plans to continue its work with competency models and ensure that results are publicly available so that these models may be a source of infor- mation for other organizations.
