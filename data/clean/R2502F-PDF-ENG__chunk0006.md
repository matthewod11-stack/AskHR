ter, many people believe they should

shake hands ﬁrmly to signal their commitment to working together. But

in some cultures, a strong handshake may be seen as an attempt to

# intimidate or assert dominance.

If you go in with a ﬁrm handshake and see

a negative reaction, explain the intention

behind your gesture: “It seems that I

squeezed your hand unexpectedly hard. In

my culture, strong handshakes are usually

a way to show enthusiasm and an intention

to collaborate. Until now, I thought it was

something everyone did. I apologize if my

actions sent the wrong message.”

Heiko Hellwig photographed the complex choreography of Siamese fighting fish for his series Grand Ballet.

Conversely, if you were on the receiving

# end of such an unexpectedly strong

handshake, remember the heightened

potential for cross-cultural misunderstandings before reacting

negatively. Adopt a principle of charity in interpreting the behavior and

say: “That is a ﬁrm handshake indeed. I assume that you are signaling

your commitment to this negotiation. I appreciate your gesture.”

Casting people’s words and actions in a positive light may look naive,

but it is a best practice in cross-cultural negotiations—even if you are

facing a win-lose counterpart. If the gesture was indeed the expression

of a good intention, you’ve shown that you understood and have

validated the behavior. If the counterpart had a win-lose intention,

you’ve shown that the person’s power move did not faze you, thus

reducing the odds that the domineering behavior will continue. Even

if it persists, you’ll have given an early warning that you will not be

intimidated.

# Don’t Adapt Rituals, Co-Create New Ones

Cross-cultural negotiations are further complicated by rituals—the

established and sometimes symbolic actions, behaviors, or even

ceremonies through which people convey messages and meaning

within a social or cultural group. If all members in a group accept and

adopt similar rituals, social interactions become smoother, faster, more

pleasant, and automatic. In other words, rituals are culturally approved

shortcuts for communicating important messages eﬃciently within a

group. They facilitate the process of relationship building.

## But among people from diﬀerent cultures, variances in rituals may

expand the communication gap and cause misunderstanding and

conﬂicts. Unfortunately, people often express themselves or act without

thinking consciously about how others who are unfamiliar with their

rituals will interpret their words, behaviors, and moves. For negotiators, this can hamper eﬀorts to build a trusting relationship and increases the

chances that benign behaviors will be misconstrued as adversarial.

Note that diﬀerences in rituals have an impact not on what the parties

want but on how they prefer to achieve their goals. Some cultures—

and individuals—tend to be rigid with time or deadlines; others are

lax. Some like to tackle problems head-on; others like to go around

them. Some like to talk straight; others are more indirect and careful.

Some prize independence and empowerment; others prefer collective

# decision-making and consensus-building.
