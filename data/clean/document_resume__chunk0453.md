# Supervisor Appraisal

Probably the most important source of judgmental data is the immediate superior. A manager has both a right and a duty to make appraisal and developmental decisions regarding subordinates. In addition, the superior normally assigns the w oil, and is responsible for rewards and sanctions. The liabilities of super\ isory appraisal include the familiar objection to "playing God" as well as the lack of interpersonal skills needed to maintain positive relationships with subordinates. Moreover; there is always the possibility of rater errors, including favoritism and bias.
