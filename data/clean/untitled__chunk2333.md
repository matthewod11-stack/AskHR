# Historical Periods Deﬁned

Although derived from similar origins and early develop- ments, contemporary school psychology is a specialty dis- tinct from clinical, counseling, and educational psychology. The historical development of school psychology has been described as consisting of two broad periods, the Hybrid Years (1890–1969) and the Thoroughbred Years (1970– present) (Fagan & Wise, 2000). During the Hybrid Years,

school psychology was often a blend of educational and psy- chological practice; its dominant role was assessment to meet public education’s need for diagnoses for special class place- ment. Even in the latter decades of this period, school psy- chology was a mix of practitioners trained and certiﬁed in various ﬁelds (e.g., clinical psychology, teacher education, and guidance counseling) as well as many whose training and experience were speciﬁcally in school psychology.

The Thoroughbred Years period differs from the previous period because of the rapid growth in the number of training programs, practitioners, and state and national associations, the expansion of literature, and increasing professional regu- lationfromforceswithinandoutsideoftheﬁeld.Collectively, these changes contributed to a stable professional entity known as school psychology. Since 1970, school psychol- ogists have been more consistently employed in positions titled “school psychologist”; they work in states offering school psychology credentials to those who have completed training programs speciﬁcally in school psychology and accredited as such and whose trainers have been school psy- chologists. This greater uniformity has been modal in the Thoroughbred Years, although it could be observed in more advanced locales in the latter Hybrid Years, especially in urban and suburban areas (Mullen, 1967). The Thorough- bred period was not achieved simply because of an identity made possible by more purely bred school psychologists. The Hybrid Years had many persons who championed the cause and identity of school psychology despite their own backgrounds in clinical and educational psychology, teacher education, and guidance counseling.Among the nota- bles were Harry Baker, Jack Bardon, Ethel Cornell, Susan Gray, Leta Hollingworth, Bertha Luckey, Grace Munson, Frances Mullen, T. E. Newland, Marie Skodak, and Percival Symonds.
