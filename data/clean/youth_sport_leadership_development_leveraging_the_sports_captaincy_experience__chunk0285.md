## DETERMINING THE LEADERSHIP CAPACITY OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

Developmental research tells us that while high school students may look like adults, they differ developmentally in many ways. For example, while they have the ability to be empathic and focus on the needs of others, they are still more egocentric, or self-focused, than adults (Kegan, 1982). This developmental consideration certainly affects their leadership capacity since much of leadership requires self-sacriﬁce and a focus on the welfare of oth- ers. We constantly ﬁnd ourselves asking questions like, what is the capacity for youth leaders to develop transformational leadership skills, like playing a role in developing the team’s vision? Or, given the emphasis on peer ap- proval, how likely is it that youth leaders will feel comfortable calling out teammates who are not giving maximum effort or conforming to team rules? We are hoping to provide answers to questions like these by continuing to acquire information through research and professional practice.
