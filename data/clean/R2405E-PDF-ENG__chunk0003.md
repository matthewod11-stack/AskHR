As the markets celebrate the success of gen-AI and green-tech

start-ups, many experts are urging established companies to emulate

those ventures by committing to radical innovation—by disrupting

themselves before someone else does. But for a lot of incumbent

companies, that’s just not a feasible strategy. Their owners don’t like

risk and won’t kill the goose that lays the golden egg. As a result large

enterprises end up defaulting to incremental innovation, perversely

increasing the chances that they’ll get upended.
