# WORK/LIFE BALANCE

To assess how various work/life initiatives aﬀect the man-

agement workforce, we looked at data from over 800 U.S. companies across more than 30 years and talked to dozens of managers. We found that when companies had universal policies for family leave time, ﬂexible scheduling, and help with childcare, the percentages of Black, Hispanic, and Asian American male and female managers increased sig- niﬁcantly. So did the percentage of white female managers. Why do those groups beneﬁt so much from work/life

support? Because they face the greatest work/life challenges. Women and people of color are, for example, more likely to be single parents than white men are. Single mothers head 41% of Black families, 25% of Hispanic families, 13% of white families, and 11% of Asian American families. Single fathers head 12% of Black and Hispanic families and 7% of white and Asian American families.

Then there’s the fact that people of color in the United States, on average, have fewer resources than white people do. They’re more likely to be in poorly paid jobs, with even two-parent households needing both partners’ 40 (or 60) hours’ worth of weekly wages just to make ends meet. Before Covid-19, the median Black or Hispanic family of three earned just 61% of what the median white family did and was twice as likely to live in poverty. Those numbers have barely changed since the 1970s.

people of color need it the most. But they are the least likely to actually get it. Three reasons for this stand out. First, many companies oﬀer work/life perks only informally and dole them out to prized high-wage employees. When the CEO’s white right-hand man has twin newborns, he gets whatever he needs, but the Hispanic woman in the mailroom who is in the same situation may not be so lucky. Second, many com- panies oﬀer support only in workplaces dominated by pro- fessionals and managers—notably, headquarters and R&D labs—where white men typically prevail. Third, supervisors often have to sign oﬀ on requests for ﬂextime and leave and have to rank-order employees for childcare spots. When they do those things, they tend not to be very accommodating to people in frontline jobs that they view as easy to ﬁll.

The problem, at heart, is that many companies’ attitudes toward work/life balance have changed little since the 1950s. Sure, big companies today list generous work/life beneﬁts on their websites and during recent hiring sprees may even have expanded the support they oﬀer. But those same companies signal in countless ways that their ideal worker is somebody unencumbered by family obligations who can adhere to the kind of demanding daily schedules and career trajectories that were standard for white-collar white men 70 years ago. That model rarely worked back then for Black, Hispanic, or Asian American employees or white women. And it rarely works for anyone now.

People of color also more often lack access to reliable and aﬀordable childcare—which allows parents to stay in their jobs and develop the skills and reputation needed for career advancement. On top of that, they often face stronger performance pressures and have to work harder to prove their talents. For instance, as Ella Bell Smith and Stella Nkomo document in the pathbreaking book Our Separate Ways, Black women are more likely than white women to be underestimated by their supervisors and to be disciplined. When employees lose childcare or when their partners’ work schedules change, they sometimes have to quit their jobs. That sets their seniority clock to zero if and when they take on a new job, delaying their opportunities for promotion. This pattern has prevented many women and people of color from moving into supervisory roles and helps explain why the face of corporate management has been changing so slowly. To succeed, almost every employee needs work/life

support at some point, and the data suggests that women and

Covid-19 provided the ultimate proof of the concept that

ﬁrms can remain eﬃcient while allowing employees more leeway in where and when they do their work: Even though millions switched to ﬂexible and remote work arrangements during the pandemic, productivity didn’t decline. But as the pandemic faded, many companies reverted to what execu- tives still perceive as their safe place: oﬃce work. However, two-thirds of Covid-era remote workers report that they don’t want to return to the oﬃce. When required to, many who can aﬀord to resign do just that. Others who appreciate the extra time they’ve had with their families negotiate to keep their newfound ﬂexibility. In fact, in a recent survey 64% of employees at top companies said they would forgo a $30,000 raise if it meant they didn’t have to return to the oﬃce.

But stepping out of the labor force is rarely an option for the many workers in low-wage positions where people of color prevail or those who have worked hard to build
