# HBR / Magazine Article / HR’s New Role

kind of beneﬁt, including training and development, got squeezed.

Work demands went up, and job security fell.

Now the pendulum has swung sharply the other way. The U.S.

unemployment rate has been below 4% for ﬁve years, with the exception

of the Covid shutdown period. Productivity growth has lagged, with

the 2010s being the worst decade for it in modern times. That,

along with slow growth in the labor force, will probably keep the

job market tight for some time. Meanwhile, overwork, fear of layoﬀs,

lack of advancement opportunities, and worries of being replaced by

technologies like artiﬁcial intelligence have created an epidemic of

workplace stress in the United States. Evidence that companies have hit the limits of lean staﬃng includes the remarkable Kaiser Permanente

strike of 2023, which was the largest health-care labor dispute in U.S.

history, and pharmacists’ walkouts and sick-outs at CVS and Walgreens.

In all those disputes one of the main worker demands was that the

companies staﬀ open positions.

HR’s focus on minimizing personnel costs was not a problem when

job markets were cool. But now keeping positions ﬁlled and preventing

employees from burning out or becoming dissatisﬁed are the priorities.

To meet the fundamental challenge of hiring and retaining good

people, HR needs to return to its traditional role of taking care of

employees. It must play a lead role in persuading top management to

treat employees better and to change company policies on pay, training,

layoﬀs, vacancies, outsourcing, and restructuring.
