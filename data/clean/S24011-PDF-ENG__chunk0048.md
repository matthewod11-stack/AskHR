soliciting advice, inviting the team members to share their perspectives

on the challenges they faced. Seeing that some were nervous, he gently

nudged them and thoughtfully probed. As team members got more

comfortable sharing their perspectives, one suggested that they start

saying no to new requests, while another pushed back because that

would compromise their objective of being a responsive team. Roger

fused these opposing viewpoints by proposing that they become better

at setting and resetting expectations about deliverables and deadlines

with their internal clients. “Every person in the room felt personally

accountable, engaged, and invested,” he recalls. As a result, valuable

ideas emerged about how the team should prioritize work, and the

chronic delays were alleviated.

using the chosen actions, and what they learned from it. Even when

things don’t turn out as desired, this practice can produce valuable

insights. As a vice president of business development at Wilton Re told

us, postmortems have helped him “translate instances of ‘failure’ into

opportunities for growth,” allowing him to ﬁnd pride in moments when

he honored his intention and tied it to his values.
