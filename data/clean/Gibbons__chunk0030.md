### **[The new reality of human-AI collaboration culture]{.underline}**

[Creating an effective human-AI collaboration culture requires
abandoning old mental models. This isn\'t about \"upskilling\" humans to
use AI tools. It\'s about reimagining how different forms of
intelligence work together.]{.underline}

[Think of AI systems as colleagues with unique characteristics: they
never tire but lack intuition, they process vastly more information but
miss emotional nuance, they identify patterns humans can\'t see but
can\'t explain why something matters to a human being. Your job is to
create a culture where these different intelligences complement rather
than compete.]{.underline}

[This demands new approaches to fundamental HR practices. Onboarding
must include not just introducing human colleagues but explaining AI
teammates\' capabilities. Team formation must consider the optimal mix
of human and artificial intelligence for different challenges.
Development conversations must help humans find their unique value when
AI can do much of what they previously did. Recognition systems must
celebrate human contributions that transcend productivity
metrics.]{.underline}
