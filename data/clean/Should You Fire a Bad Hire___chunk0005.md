- 1) Reevaluate their onboarding experience.Maybe a new hire isn’t performing as you’d expected, or they’renot just clicking with the team. At around 30 days, it’s still earlyenough to give them the benefit of the doubt and make surethey’re receiving the support they need to succeed. In fact, astheir manager, you owe them that opportunity.Take a step back and reflect on whether you’ve set them up forsuccess.

Did you set clear expectations? Poor performance might be asymptom of a new hire’s failure to understand organizationalnorms and the expectations of their position. Clearlycommunicating these upfront during the hiring andonboarding process can mitigate many pitfalls later on.

Have you given them the tools necessary to succeed?Determine if they have received adequate training to performtheir job functions, or if there are other resources or guidanceyou could provide that would help them get up to speed faster.Pairing them with a mentor or providing additional training onthe various technologies your department uses are just a fewideas of ways you can support their success.

Have you been accessible? There should be lots of back andforth during the onboarding process, with regular one-on-onecheck-ins during the early weeks of employment. If you’re sobusy you don’t have time to deal with a new employee, chancesof failure are high.If you identify gaps in their onboarding experience, then you canwork to fill those in and chart a more successful course forward.
