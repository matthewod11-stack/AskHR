# in any environmental analysis:

- Economic. For example, is there an economic recession on the horizon? Or, is the current economic recession likely to end in the near future? How would these economic trends affect our business?

- Political/legal. For example, how will political changes in domestic or inter- national markets we are planning on entering affect our entry strategy?

- Social. For example, what is the impact of an aging workforce on our organization? • Technological. For example, what technological changes are anticipated in our industry and how will these changes affect how we do business?

- Competitors. For example, how do the strategies and products of our competi- tors affect our own strategies and products? Can we anticipate our competitors’ next move?

- Customers. For example, what do our customers want now, and what will they want in the next five years or so? Can we anticipate such needs?

- Suppliers. For example, what is the relationship with our suppliers now and is it likely to change, and in what way, in the near future?

Although an examination of external trends is important for all types of organiza- tions, this issue is particularly important for multinational organizations because they are concerned with both domestic and international trends. In fact, monitoring the external environment is so important in the strategic planning of multinational organizations that a survey of U.S. multinational corporations showed that 89% of departments responsible for the assessment of the external environment report directly to a member of the board of directors.10

An examination of the internal environment includes a consideration of strengths and weaknesses. Strengths are internal characteristics that the organization can use to its advantage. For example, what are the organization’s assets and the staff’s key skills? At Frontier, several key executives from other airlines were recruited, an important strength that was considered before launching the airline in 1994. These executives created a senior management team with long-term experience in the Denver market.

Weaknesses are internal characteristics that are likely to hinder the success of the organization. These could include an obsolete organizational structure that does not allow for effective organization across units and creates the misalignment of organiza- tional-, unit-, and individual-level goals.
