# enforcement histories.

2.(cid:32) Number of Title I complaints filed with the EEOC per 100,000 people in the workforce. 3.(cid:32) The existence or not of state-level disability laws and enforcement tools. 4.(cid:32) Legal assistance, employer advocacy, and employer training are being made available. 5.(cid:32) The practice of employer accommodations based on surveys of policy and the record of public

documentation. This was developed into a compliance index that has a maximum score of 100. States were subsequently grouped into quartiles, and there was a comparative analysis between the high and low performing states. Strategic states at either extreme and acting as case studies are given, but also charts and tables used to visualize differences are provided. 4.2 High-Compliance States: Best Practices and Models California California is one of the leading states in the application of the ADA, with a score of 92 in the compliance index. This can be most credited to the liberalistic laws that govern the state, to the effective enforcement agencies, and the employer culture that embraces inclusivity (Miller, 2024).

- (cid:32) State Level Legislation: The Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) extends the protection offered under the ADA. It requires reasonable accommodation and forbids disability discrimination in the public as well as in the private sector.

- (cid:32) Enforcement Bodies: The Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) receives the complaint at the state level level relieving the federal EEOC agencies and enhancing the efficiency with which cases can be resolved.

- (cid:32) Employer Practices: Major companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, often do even more than what the ADA requires, introducing adaptive technologies, allowing people with disabilities to work, and having disability advocacy programs. Massachusetts The compliance index for Massachusetts placed its score in the high category of compliance on quality institutional commitment to disability rights and enforcement, which stands at 89 (Miller, 2024).

- (cid:32) Supplementary Protections: Massachusetts General Laws treats anti-discrimination with Chapter 151B, which contains strict anti-discrimination provisions. There is a quick handling of cases as facilitated by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD).

- (cid:32) The Public Sector Leadership: State: The ADA training is mandatory for state employees, and the government workplace accessibility is also regularly audited by the state.

- (cid:32) Ecosystem of Education: Universities and research centres are strategic stakeholders that can influence best practice, HR training type, and policy.
