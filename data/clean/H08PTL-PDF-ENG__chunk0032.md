# Fence and control AI involvement

With those power-conduit tasks in mind, establish clear policies for

where AI can be used and where human oversight must be maintained,

ensuring AI supports rather than replaces strategic decision-making.

“Fencing” a task means setting boundaries on AI’s role in executing

it. This doesn’t mean rejecting AI outright but rather deﬁning clear

conditions under which AI may assist while preserving human

oversight. For example, AI may suggest agenda structures, but the ﬁnal

decision should rest with the board chair. Similarly, AI may generate

discussion summaries, but the chair should review and reﬁne them

to ensure alignment with strategic objectives. By fencing AI’s role,

organizations can ensure that automation enhances rather than erodes
