out of organizations. Furthermore, a key factor inﬂuencing a per- son’s decision to join and remain with an organization is the ﬁt be- tween his or her personality and the modal personality of the organization (Schneider, 1987; Schneider, Goldstein, & Smith, 1995). A test of this basic ASA principle using a sample of approx- imately thirteen thousand managers from 142 companies across a broad sampling of U.S. industries revealed the hypothesized ASA effect for organizational membership on the personality charac- teristics of managers (Schneider, Smith, Taylor, & Fleenor, 1998). An implication of this ﬁnding is that organizational members have contact with others who are more like themselves in terms of their personality attributes than in the society at large. Organizational constraints that tend to perpetuate homophily are the result of the dispositionally driven choices people make with regard to which organizations to join and remain with.
