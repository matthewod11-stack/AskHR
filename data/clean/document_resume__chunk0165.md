# 1 ::gal Aspects

Reducing or eliminating adverse impact and improv ing the utilization of protected group members in all parts of the v ork force is more properly an objective than a strat- egy. Employers whc find themselves accused of Title VII violations because members of protected groups are either rejected for promotion at a disproportionate rate, under- represented in the work force, or receive lower pay are usually unable to successfully defend in court the practices in question. An analysis of these cases strongly sugge,ts that these employers have almost always waited until they got into trouble before they attempted to justify their practices, many of which were not job-related. These employ- ers were, to use a common expression, "a day late and a dollar short." Thus, a strategy of validation would seem to hav two major advantages. First, it addresses the problem of systemic discrimination, which Congress and the courts have identified as the major barrier to fair employment. Second, validation contributes to better administrative decisions.

The best sr ategy for demonstrating that a performance appraisal system is job- related is known as content validity, in w hp:h a procedure is justified by showing that it representatively samples significant parts Df a job. The following excerpts from the "Uniform Guidelines" define content validity in more detail.

A selection procedure* may be supported by a content validity strategy to the extent that it is a representative sample of the content of the job.

.. a content validity strategy is not appropriate for demonstrating the validity of selection procedures which purport to measure traits or constructs such as intelligence, aptitude, personality, common sense, judgment, leadership, and spatial ability. Content validity is also not an appropriate strategy when the selection procedure involves knowledge, skills, or abilities which an employee will be expected to learn on the job.

There should be job analysis which includes an analysis of the important work behaviors required for su :cessful performance and their relative importance. Any job analysis should focus on work behavior(s) and the tasks associated with them.

To demonstrate the content validity of a procedure, user should show that the behaviors demonstrated in the selection procedure provide a representative sample of the work product of the job. . The closer the content and the context of the selection procedure are to work samples or work behaviors, the stronger is the basis for showing content validity.10

- The term selection procedure refers to any procedure used for any employment deci- sion; thus a performance appraisal procedure is a selectioa procedure within the meaning of the "Uniform Guidelines" (see Section I6Q).
