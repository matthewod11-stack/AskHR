## CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING THIRD PARTY PROCEDURES

To compare third party procedures in their application and appropriateness for any given dispute, we need an understanding of them across a meaningful set of criteria to appreciate similarities and differences. There are also other practical reasons for clearly deﬁned criteria; agencies are accountable to clients or funding agencies and individual third parties may be given a performance evaluation based on particular criteria. In addition, we must recognize that particular procedures are not deﬁned the same way and might be implemented differently across cultures, making direct comparisons of procedures challenging. This paper builds on existing literature (e.g., Lissak & Sheppard, 1983; Meyer, Gemmell, & Irving, 1997; Sheppard, 1983, 1984; Thomas, Jamieson, & Moore, 1978; Thomas, 1992) to evaluate criteria arranged into four categories or sets: process criteria, issue criteria, and relationship criteria. Table 1 settlement criteria, categorizes the procedures detailed in the previous section according to these criteria. We then consider several speciﬁc dimensions of each category of criteria and discuss how these dimensions may be inﬂuenced by cultural factors.2 We conclude each section with propositions.
