# Absenteeism

As discussed earlier in this chapter and depicted in Figure ., when employees are dissatisfied or not committed to the organization, they are more likely to miss

work and leave their jobs than satisfied or committed employees. In the remain- ing two sections of the chapter, absenteeism and turnover will be discussed and methods to decrease these negative employee behaviors will be presented.

As shown in Table ., depending on which survey data are used, between .% and .% of the U.S. workforce is absent each day, at a cost to employers of $ per employee each year. In , employees in the United States were given an average of . sick days per year, and on average they took . of those days (Commerce Clearing House [CCH], ). Although comparable international data are difficult to come by, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry indicates that workers in the United Kingdom missed an average of . days per year in . The typical worker missed . days in Canada in , . days in Ireland (Dooley, ), and  days in the Netherlands (Karaian, ). In , the typical employee missed  days in Sweden and  days in Norway (Karaian, ). Including absences due to holidays, sickness, and parental leave, the average employee in Sweden took  weeks off work in  (OECD, )! Comparing U.S. absenteeism rates with those in other countries can be difficult because many countries require employers to provide paid days off for absenteeism whereas the United States has no such laws. In fact, data from the U.S. Department of Labor indicate that % of low-paid or part-time employees do not get a single day of paid absence.

Nutreco, an international supplier of food products, provides an excel- lent example of international differences in absenteeism. In , the overall absenteeism rate for Nutreco was .%, yet the rate varied tremendously across national borders. Absenteeism was lowest for its plants in Canada (.%), Ireland (.%), and Poland (.%) and highest for its plants in the Netherlands (.%), Norway (.%), and Belgium (.%). The absenteeism rates for Chile (.%), the UK (.%), Spain (.%), and France (.%) fell in the middle. Organizations throughout the world are concerned with absenteeism, not only because of its high monetary cost, but also because absenteeism is correlated with turnover (r = .) and is thought to be a warning sign of intended turnover (Griffeth et al., ).
