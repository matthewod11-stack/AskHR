## Aspen Institute’s Economic Opportunities Program and MIT’s Institute

for Work and Employment Research, we lay out a more collaborative

—and eﬀective— approach to leading the organized, and organizing,

workforce. We’ll focus on the U.S. landscape in this article, but we’ll

also highlight approaches that work in Europe and around the world.

how business and organized labor need to modernize, and how to bring

about changes in the law to accommodate new realities.
