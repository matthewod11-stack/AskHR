# 9 EXPLORING EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS IN SEARCH FUND–ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

Beyond digital tools, there is the tangible, physical side of offboarding: reclaiming physical and digital assets. Teams may forget to retrieve items like laptops or ID badges, leading to unnecessary follow-ups and sometimes even security risks. Laptops, phones, credit cards, and even uniforms need to be returned promptly. Digital storage devices, like USB drives and external hard drives, are equally important, as they could hold sensitive company data.

It is easy to focus on digital security and hardware, but manual systems often get overlooked. Forgetting to update physical keys, building access codes, or security badges can create vulnerabilities that are easy to avoid with a bit of planning. Updating access control logs immediately is a simple yet essential step that can prevent headaches later.

Finally, it is imperative to close the loop with a thorough audit. Partnering with IT and HR teams to confirm that all access points have been addressed and assets returned is a vital step. There’s nothing worse than discovering weeks later that an old account is still active or that a key piece of hardware is missing. Preparing an internal communication plan ensures that the team understands the offboarding changes without breaching confidentiality or professionalism. Notifying departments like finance for payroll adjustments or facilities for security updates ensures a seamless transition and avoids disruption to the broader team.25

04 Conducting the termination meeting

The timing of employee terminations significantly impacts the process’s effectiveness and its effects on both the departing employee and the organization. Research suggests that early-day terminations are advantageous as they allow employees to access support services during business hours, enable administrative teams to promptly handle offboarding tasks, and provide the employee with privacy to process the news.26 Conducting terminations earlier in the week, such as on Tuesday or Wednesday, further ensures resource availability, facilitates task redistribution within the team, and allows colleagues to provide and receive emotional support. Experts caution against end-of-week or late-day terminations due to the risks of isolation over the weekend and delayed administrative processes, which can exacerbate distress.27

During the meeting itself, creating the right environment is key. Hold the conversation in a private setting,28 ensuring two people are present—one to deliver the message and another to observe and document.29 In most instances, having a lawyer present heightens anxiety and may escalate the situation, so avoid having one attend the termination meeting. A clear and rehearsed script helps maintain focus, providing a concise explanation of the termination, the effective date, and any separation terms. Avoid lengthy explanations or emotional escalation by sticking to the facts and framing the conversation with professionalism.30

Tone and approach play a critical role in the success of the meeting. It is vital to remain direct and unambiguous, avoiding overly vague or sympathetic language that could confuse the situation. At the same time, keep the meeting brief to minimize stress for both parties. While empathy is essential, the meeting should not devolve into a counseling session—focus instead on clarity, fairness, and respect. By handling the termination with thoughtful timing and a professional tone, organizations can balance operational efficiency with compassion for the departing employee.31
