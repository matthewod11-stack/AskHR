# Focus on the Fundamentals

When it feels like everything is changing, it helps to focus on the things

that stay the same, the things that need our attention, and where we can

make a tangible diﬀerence. You can start with these three actions.

Step back and take stock.

It’s easy to become distracted by the challenging economic, social, and

geopolitical context in which organizations currently operate. But also

use these times to focus on where exactly you are at the moment and where you want to get to. How can you reaﬃrm the core purpose of your

(and indeed all) organizations, which is to deliver a service or product

that is valued by its customers and to provide an environment where

people want to belong? The leadership challenge looks a little simpler

if you stay focused on those goals and encourage the people you work

with to do the same.

Strengthen the ties that bind.

Organizations exist to bring together people of diﬀerent expertise and

abilities to undertake activities that cannot be achieved by acting

alone. We learn to collaborate with colleagues we may not like or even

particularly respect because we need their help to get the work done.

When steering an organization through liminal times, expressions of

personal diﬀerence can easily come across as defensive. It’s worth

remembering that some diﬀerences contribute to a job done well.

Sustaining organizational connections feeds a sense of collective
