# A Scientiﬁc Art? 339

preventive social action. . . . We should offer the slum parent something better than a choice between race suicide and child murder.”

He began to subtitle The Psychological Clinic as A Jour- nal of Orthogenics, and each issue thereafter carried that subtitle and a deﬁnition of orthogenics: “While orthogenics concerns itself primarily with the causes and treatment of retardation and deviation, it is by deﬁnition the science of normal development, and comprehends within its scope all the conditions which facilitate, conserve, or obstruct the nor- mal development of mind and body” (Witmer, 1925). Obvi- ously, in view of the title of this chapter not too many people warmed up to orthogenics as a new designation, but Witmer’s vision for the scope of the ﬁeld he began has gained in acceptance over the years.

A SCIENTIFIC ART?

Scientiﬁc psychiatry is probably best regarded as originating around the nineteenth century, though like scientiﬁc psy- chology it can trace its origins back over 2,000 years to the philosophers and medical practitioners of ancient Greece. Hippocrates spoke of mania, melancholia, phrenitis, hysteria, and paranoia and thought of these as medical disorders, prob- ably brought about by an excess of one type or another of humor, or bodily ﬂuid (Routh, 1998). By and large, however, he recommended that patients with mental disorders be treated with kindness, soothing music, and rest. The Roman physician Galen (A.D. 129–198), promoted the view that the etiology of speciﬁc disorders lay with excess humors, such as black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm, which led to the treatment of the mentally ill with purges, vomits, bleeding, and expectorants; these were the treatments widely used in Western societies to the end of the eighteenth century.

During the eighteenth century, there emerged on several fronts a different way of looking at people. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) argued that people are naturally good but that they are corrupted by their society. If allowed to develop naturally, or freely to experience the world and the consequences of their behaviors, a natural goodness or nobility would be expressed. Rousseau argued it was the artiﬁcialities of the social order that drove people to despair and that a simple life, close to nature, was best. Clearly Rousseau’s inﬂuence can be seen today in natural remedies and holistic medicine.
