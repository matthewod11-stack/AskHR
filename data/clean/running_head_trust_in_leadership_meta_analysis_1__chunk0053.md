# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

yet know whether effects are distinct from those of other leadership styles. Typically,

leadership styles are studied in isolation, or at best alongside few others. As such, scholars in

the leadership domain often fail to show the incremental effects of one leadership approach

over others (Hunter et al., 2007; Piccolo et al., 2012). This makes it hard to discern the

distinctiveness of leadership constructs (DeRue et al., 2011) and understand their relative

ability to affect trust.

What is needed to resolve the fragmentation in the field are critical tests of theory

where key leadership styles are examined concurrently to build a more parsimonious

understanding of their value. Initial attempts have been made through meta-analytical

methods (e.g., Banks et al., 2016; Hoch et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018, Lee et al., 2020, Ng &

Feldman, 2015). In the present study, we seek to contribute to this literature by meta-

analytically comparing the relative effects of eight leadership styles on trust and subsequent

performance outcomes (see below). In the first stage, we compare the relative variance

explained by each style over that explained by the full-range model of transformational and

transactional leadership. Given the dominance of this model in the literature, and its broad

coverage of leadership behaviours, it serves an important comparative function. Further,

recent critiques of transformational leadershipâ€™s theoretical foundations and practical

relevance (e.g., van Knippenberg & Sitkin, 2013), make it even more important to isolate

whether other styles are meaningfully different.

In the second stage, we compare the relative importance of the contemporary

leadership styles. Ideally, we would assess the relative importance of all six leadership styles

(ethical, servant, empowering, paternalistic, authentic and abusive) together. However, the

limited availability of primary data means that here we can only compare the effects of
