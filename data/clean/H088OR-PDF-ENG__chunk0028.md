# Using This Data to Improve Meetings

In addition to our analysis, we are also directly engaged with

a small group of companies to deﬁne and implement practical

applications for this data. After several rounds of conversations

with organizational leaders who’ve reviewed the insights from their

company’s collaboration data, as well as the benchmarks and broader

trends mentioned above, we’ve compiled some key takeaways you

might consider applying at your own organization.
