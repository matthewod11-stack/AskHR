# Illustration by Harriet Lee-Merrion

AI entered mainstream consciousness in November 2022 when

ChatGPT burst onto the scene and scooped up more than a million

active users in one month. No longer just for tech giants and scientists,

AI was suddenly pitched as a transformative force that anyone

could use. The proliferation of advanced AI models like DeepSeek

that lowered costs and made AI integration easier has only further

heightened expectations of what AI might be able to do for companies.
