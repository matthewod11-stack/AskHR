# Multiple Agents & Their Evaluation

Agent evaluation, which assesses the effectiveness, reliability, and adaptability of

autonomous AI agents, as seen in the previous section, has emerged as a key focus area.

We have seen a significant evolution in AI systems, transitioning towards multi-agent

architecturesâ€”where multiple specialized agents collaborate to achieve complex objectives.

A multi-agent system is like a team of experts, each specializing in a particular area, working

together to solve a complex problem. Each agent is an independent entity, potentially using a

different LLM, and with its own unique role and context. Agents communicate and collaborate

to achieve a common goal. This approach differs from traditional single-agent systems,

where one LLM handles all aspects of a task.

Multi-agent systems offer several advantages over single-agent systems:

- Enhanced Accuracy: Agents can cross-check each other's work, leading to more
