characteristics of managers and union officials; and 3) different types of supervisory behavior as they influence the level of grievance activity. The majority of this psychological research has centered on identifying demographic and job-related characteristics that differentiate employees who file grievances from those who don’t (e.g., Ash, 1970; Price, Dewine, Nowark, Shenkel & Ronan, 1976; Dalton & Tudor, 1982). As many as 40 separate independent variables have been employed in a single study. Unfortunately, psychologically based research on grievance filing uses many different vari- ables rather than a common set of indepen- dent variables and, perhaps because of this, there are few replication-type studies in this research.

emphasis that foremen placed on job/task structure. Later, Walker & Robinson (1977) found that “autocratic” supervisors had fewer grievances and were better contract adminis- trators than “democratic” supervisors. Unfor- tunately, the research instrument used by these researchers does not allow direct com- parison with the Ohio State Leadership Ques- tionnaire used earlier by Fleishman & Harris (1962). Studies by Bemmels (1994) and Bemmels, Reshef, & Stratton-Devine (1991), however, drew directly on Fleishman and Har- ris’ (1962) work to construct empirical mea- sures of supervisors’ “consideration” and “structure”. Consideration had a negative re- lationship with grievance filing rates in both of these studies, but structure was positively related to grievance filing rates only in Bemmels’ (1994) study.

Nevertheless, there is some evidence from these studies that grievants are more likely to be younger, male, have more education, and hold more skilled jobs than non-grievants. Further, grievants are more likely to have higher absenteeism rates, dispensary visits, and insurance claim filing rates than non- grievants (Labig & Greer, 1988). Even with respect to these variables, however, one or more studies were unable to identify any sig- nificant differences between grievants and non-grievants. Further, no significant differ- ences between grievants and non-grievants were found concerning marital status, and contradictory findings have emerged with re- spect to the effects of race, tenure, pay, and promotions on grievance filing in unionized settings. There has also been insufficient re- search on the role of personality variables in grievance filing to draw firm conclusions in this regard (Stagner, 1956, 1962; Gordon & Bowlby 1989).

Another strand of research by psycholo- gists has centered on differences in supervi- sory style and the effects of these differences on levels of work place grievance activity. Fleishman and Harris (1962) found that fore- men judged high on “consideration” showed a negative but curvilinear relationship with grievance filing by employees in their work groups, whereas the opposite was true of “task- oriented” foremen. Additional analysis showed that grievances occurred most frequently among work groups whose foremen were low in consideration regardless of the amount of

The research by Bemmels (1994) and Bemmels, Reshef, & Stratton-Devine (1991) is especially notable for the inclusion of shop stewards’ assessment of how frequently em- ployees approach them with complaints. The researchers propose that “employees’ com- plaining to their steward is a precursor to griev- ance filing” (p. 368). Both of these studies found that work groups with employees who more frequently complained to shop stewards had higher grievance filing rates than work groups with less frequent complaints. In ad- dition, both studies found that supervisor con- sideration was negatively related to the frequency of employee complaints to their stewards, supervisor structure was positively related to the frequency of employee com- plaints to their stewards, and the steward’s assessment of the supervisor’s knowledge of the collective bargaining agreement was nega- tively related to employee complaints. Over- all, however, Bemmels & Foley (1996) conclude that “the effect of structure on griev- ance rates from earlier studies were . . . mixed, and the mixed results from these two recent studies do not clarify what, if any, relation- ship exists between structure and grievance rates” (p. 367).

For senior human resource and labor re- lations executives, the key findings that emerge from this psychological research pertain to the types of employees who (are likely to) use the grievance procedure and
