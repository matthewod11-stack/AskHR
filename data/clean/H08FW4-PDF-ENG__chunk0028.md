Simply stated, governance is the act of regularly bringing together

the right roles, aligned against clear priorities, and equipping them

with the right data and authority to make informed decisions and to

hold the organization accountable for execution. Ultimately, well-run

governance aligns the organization, ensuring that all consequential

decisions are consistent with the organization’s stated objectives.

Where executive teams fall short Sadly, too many leadership teams struggle to establish suﬃcient

governance to keep their organizations focused and moving forward.

Despite their best intentions, they get mired in too many priorities,

fail to clarify decision rights, follow undisciplined resource-allocation

processes, and poorly document (then fail to communicate) outcomes.

One of the most common shortfalls is maintaining bloated membership.

This “more is better” trend toward greater inclusion, usually justiﬁed

by the complexities of industry dynamics or wide portfolios, denies the

reality that too many leaders seated at any governance table creates

unwieldy dynamics as the number of relationships to manage increases.
