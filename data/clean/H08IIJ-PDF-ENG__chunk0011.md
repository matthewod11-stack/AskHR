# The Costs for Relationship-Building

These interaction practices achieved what they aimed to do: namely,

cut out interactions at work that were not purely task-focused to

save time for caregiving. Despite being devoted professionals, these

workers generally spent the morning, evenings, and weekends with

their children while achieving professional success.

However, these interaction practices had a cost. Parents who extensively

tried to control interactions through these strategies ended up having

weak relationships with colleagues, which extensive research has shown

is important to being successful in the workplace. While they sometimes

had one or two close friends — which research shows is important even

if one cannot maintain a large social network — they did not feel they

had many close friends, did not feel a sense of belonging at work, and

were out of the loop on workplace gossip.

There was a tradeoﬀ between saving time for family and developing

relationships, as we saw by studying the set of workers who did not have

such caregiving responsibilities (men and women without children, and

the subset of fathers who had a wife who took charge of organizing care

for the kids — no mothers in our research had such a spouse). These

workers did engage more socially at work: taking longer lunch breaks

at restaurants, chatting in the hall, popping by one another’s oﬃce to

discuss work gossip, and going to the bar after work. However, because

they also had to get their work done, this meant less time for hobbies,

non-work friends, and — for these fathers — their children.
