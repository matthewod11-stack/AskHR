# opportunities for all individuals.

Ensure that all your oﬃces have a mother’s room, where women can

pump comfortably and privately. Consider installing a hospital-grade

pump so she can bring just her pump parts instead of her machine in.

Design rooms to include comfortable seating, a fridge, a sink, and a

microwave. Allowing women who travel for work the beneﬁt of shipping

their breast milk home can be a game-changer.

Back-up child care is another key oﬀering, which many companies

have added during the pandemic. Finally, tech companies including Facebook, Google and Salesforce, have also started to oﬀer additional paid time oﬀ for caregivers.
