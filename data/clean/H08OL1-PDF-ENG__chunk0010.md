## Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter’s landmark work

on tokenism. Kanter’s research examined group dynamics when one

group heavily outnumbers another, deﬁning a “skewed” group as one

where there’s 85:15 majority-to-minority ratio. Up to the point of 15%,

underrepresented individuals are known to face polarization from the

majority or be pressured to conform to stereotypes. Ultimately, these

people are often seen as symbols or “tokens” rather than individuals,

and may feel isolated based on how they are treated.

However, their sparse presence and anomaly status also heightens their

visibility. And when there are social or legal pressures to improve equity

or to achieve diversity goals—in our case, to improve gender equity

speciﬁcally—the incentives to protect the organization’s reputation and

image may motivate companies to increase the proportion of women

and/or improve pay equity. In short, a more deliberate eﬀort is made to

close the gap and early gains are made.
