Fair point. Does the research suggest a better way to select leaders?

We recommend that institutions de-emphasize ambition as a factor

in the selection process. Instead, they should focus on attributes that are known to predict leadership eﬀectiveness, such as intelligence and

sociability. Further, they should solicit a wider, more representative

pool of applicants and ﬁnd ways to target and inspire individuals who

have low ambition and high leadership potential.

Is there a risk that you will force people into leadership roles that they don’t want?

I don’t think forcing people into leadership roles is a sustainable

solution. However, there may be many people who would be perfectly

capable leaders but lack conﬁdence or just don’t recognize themselves

in the leaders they see around them. When discussing our research,

people often share with us that they know people who ﬁt that

description. Given the chance, those individuals may ﬂourish. We hope

that workplaces ﬁnd ways to target these low-visibility, high-potential

employees and boost their conﬁdence so that they don’t opt out of
