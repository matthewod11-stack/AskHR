# Non–Big Five Predictor Variables

Personality variables that are more speciﬁc than Big Five factors or simply not included in the Big Five are also important. An exam- ple of insights gained about important outcome variables and the role of a speciﬁc personality variable not a part of the Big Five is work by Stewart and Roth (2001) in their meta-analysis of risk propensity of entrepreneurs. Risk propensity is greater for entre- preneurs than managers; even larger differences exist between ven- ture- or growth-focused entrepreneurs and family income-focused entrepreneurs. A provocative study by Douglas and Martinko (2001) found that trait anger, attribution style, negative affectivity, attitudes toward revenge, self-control, and previous exposure to ag- gressive cultures (several non–Big Five personality variables) ac- counted for 62 percent of the variance in self-reported workplace aggression. (For a list of other variables not well represented in the Big Five, see Hough and Furnham, 2003.)

Entire domains of variables are not well represented in the Big Five and need to be incorporated into our taxonomy of personal- ity variables and theories about performance. In this section, two such domains—interests and emotions—are described and their importance portrayed.
