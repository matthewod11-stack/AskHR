## The Four Dimensions of Compensation Design

Modern compensation systems can generally be analyzed along four dimensions: fixed versus variable, short­term versus long­term, cash versus equity, and individual versus group. The factors that drive choices include the firm’s stra­ tegic objectives, ability to attract and retain talent, ownership structure, culture, corporate governance, and cash flow. Within the Russell 3000 Index, companies focus on aligning pay and company performance—something stakeholders

Short- versus long-term. A second dimension is the extent to which variable compensation is paid out in the year it is awarded or deferred and paid over some future period. This applies to awards where the amount (a specified cash payment or a fixed number of shares) is established up front and where it’s based on meeting specified future hurdles. Short­term variable compensation generally takes the form of cash; long­term generally is delivered in equity, through instruments such as stock options, restricted stock, and performance shares. (See the sidebar “The Elements of Long­ Term Compensation.”)
