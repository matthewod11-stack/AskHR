Although cognitive processes are important, and we argue below that the cognitive effects of humor on individuals might be important in and of themselves, we believe that the emotional responses to humor represent an important ﬁnal step in the humor appreciation process. Humor’s role in the activation of positive emotions, we believe, is a key aspect of the theoretical rationale for why humor in organizations is likely to be so important.

Finally, it is important to address the possibility that the use of humor in communications can be associated with negative affect as well. However, we repeat the same caution we raised above in relation to ‘‘negative humor.’’ That is, although communications that include a humorous form might result in negative affect in the audience, it is inappropriate to blame humor. Rather, Wyer and Collins’ (1992) principle of ‘elaboration’ suggests that if a humorous communication results in cognitive elaborations that are mostly associated with negative affect (e.g., self-doubt, uncertainty, dead puppies), then the ‘‘humor’’ will result in negative affect.
