# Overview

suggest a twofold, expanded view of this thesis. First, they consider worker happiness as psychological well-being. Second, incorporating Fredricksonâ€™s (1998, 2001) broaden-and-build model of positive emotions as the theoretical base, the authors suggest that the job satisfaction to job performance and job satisfaction to employee retention relationships may be better explained by controlling for the moderating effect of psychological well-being. Future research directions for human resource professionals are introduced.

In the seventh paper, Conlon, Meyer, Lytle, and Willaby focus on alternative dispute third party procedures and how these procedures are used in different cultural contexts. Next, the authors evaluate the procedures in terms of how they impact four key criteria that have been noted in the literature related to negotiation: process criteria, settlement criteria, issue-related criteria, and relationship criteria. Then, they subsequently explore the potential impact of culture on evaluations of these criteria. The authors conclude with a discussion of future directions for research and practice, emphasizing that procedural recommendations should be made carefully when the criteria for effective- ness and applicability are derived from US-centric research.
