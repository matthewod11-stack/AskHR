# Literary Development

Literary development followed quickly upon the expansion of the 1960s. The NASP founded its School Psychology

Digest (now the School Psychology Review) in 1972 as a member subscription journal, and it has one of the largest cir- culations of all psychology journals. The Division of School Psychology-APA founded Professional School Psychology (now School Psychology Quarterly) in 1986. The division’s journal was an indirect outgrowth of its monograph series in the 1970s. Both groups improved the content and size of their newsletters and provided other products in print and nonprint media. The NASPdeveloped an array of products speciﬁcally for school psychology training programs and practitioners, and the APAconducted a broad expansion of its publications. Both groups published codes of ethics, standards, and refer- ence materials (e.g., membership, training, and credentialing directories). Division 16 produced several “Conversation Series” interviews on videotape that were used in training programs in the 1990s. Also of interest to literary expansion in the United States was the founding of School Psychology International in 1979 and the Canadian Journal of School Psychology in 1985.

Numerous books on school psychology and related topics were published, including those that were revised peri- odically, for example, Best Practices in School Psychology (Thomas & Grimes, 1995) and The Handbook of School Psychology (Reynolds & Gutkin, 1999). In contrast to earlier periods, there were a considerable number of books on con- sultation, intervention, and service delivery alternatives.

Communication among school psychologists was spurred as well by the widespread use of computers with Internet and electronic mail capacity. Organizations, journals, school sys- tems, university programs, and many school psychologists disseminated information via Web sites and listservs.

National efforts were reﬂected at the state association level as well. The state school psychology associations produced a mass of literature and products of their own, including widely disseminated newsletters. Whereas school psychologists dur- ing the HybridYears had suffered a dearth of communication, the Thoroughbred Years approached communication over- load, especially in print and Internet communication. In addi- tion, practitioners with subspecialty interests often garnered information beyond the core school psychology sources. It was indeed the “information age” for all of psychology.
