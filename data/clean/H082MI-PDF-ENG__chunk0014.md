# Risks

I’ve heard employees say that forming human connections can be risky:

there’s a risk of exclusion, or being ignored or judged, all of which feel

heightened in remote work. Reﬂect and consider where your team may

stand in terms of barriers to making connections. If anyone on your

team has stated they feel like there’s a risk to making connections,

your ﬁrst step as their leader is to determine whether the risk is real

or perceived. Real risk is based on something that has happened, while

perceived risk is internal and possibly based on an employee’s negative

thought patterns. Regardless of why the risk is there, empathetically

address it so your employees feel safe and so they can trust that work

can be a place of community.
