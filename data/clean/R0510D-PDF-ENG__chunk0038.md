## How to Wield Influence and Stay Informed by Graham Sher

As the chief executive of the nonproﬁt that manages the supply of blood products for all of Canada except the province of Que- bec, I instituted an ofﬁce of strategy man- agement to help me cope with three big challenges in implementing a strategic agenda. First, I spend a great deal of time dealing with external demands and constit- uents. In addition to reporting to the board of directors of my organization, Canadian Blood Services (CBS), I must also focus on the 12 Canadian provincial and territorial governments that provide its funding. So I have limited time and information with which to manage internal issues.

Also, while many people believe that chief

executives wield direct and easy inﬂuence, the reality is that any CEO has a difﬁcult time inﬂuencing his or her organization. A CEO’s attempts to command and control un- dermine the authority of senior executives. I want to exert my inﬂuence indirectly and in a way that empowers my executives and cre- ates an environment in which they can lead and manage their parts of the organization. I set the tone, and I deﬁne the strategic agenda, communicate it, and ensure that it gets undertaken, but I don’t command any parts of the organization.

My third challenge is staying informed.

Information, particularly bad news, is ﬁl- tered before it gets to me. I typically do not see the most timely, valid information about CBS’s current performance. Before our OSM was implemented, we were spending way too much time debating the quality of our information—obviously an unwieldy way of executing strategy and a very time-intensive way of conducting management meetings.
