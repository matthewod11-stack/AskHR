# HBR / Digital Article / Why Mentoring Programs Fail — and How to Make Them Worthw…

Sharing compelling stories of employees who have achieved signiﬁcant

career milestones through mentoring brings the beneﬁts of, and need

for, mentoring to life for each individual employee.

These stories can be communicated through internal newsletters,

video testimonials, and company meetings, capturing employees’

imaginations by giving them scenarios they can aspire to match and

illustrating the tangible beneﬁts of participation. Focus on the end

result — what mentoring helped individuals achieve — rather than

simply talking about mentoring without context. Your employees need

to be drawn toward mentoring when hearing the stories, seeing it as

important to help them meet their own career objectives.
