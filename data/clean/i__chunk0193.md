# employee text analytics= and so on.

The forthcoming third wave of analytics is anticipated to fulfill all expectations, empowering

businesses to harness advanced and predictive analytics capabilities. As McCartney and Fu

(2021, page 5) quoted from Angrave et al. (2016) suggest: <Rather than providing strategic

and predictive analytics that allow organizations to ask and answer big questions about how

value can be created, captured and leveraged, HRIS typically provide answers to a more limited

set of questions focused on operational reporting [...] the costly analytics capabilities provided

by the latest forms of HRIS are failing to deliver strategic HR analytics capabilities=.

King (2016, page 491) suggests that <the ability for analytics to be applied in a meaningful way

has been hindered, not helped, by the growing HR analytics industry, which is often built upon

products and services that fail to meet the needs of HR professionals and organizations=.
