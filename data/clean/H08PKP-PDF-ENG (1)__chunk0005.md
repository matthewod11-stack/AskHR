## and a sharp decline in execution—in short, widespread change fatigue.

As executive coaches, we’ve consistently seen that leaders who take

on impossible goals don’t do it because they lack judgment—they do

it because pushing back feels risky to them. Pressure from the top, a

culture of “yes,” and intense market competition make committing the

only safe choice. Many leaders also fall into the well-known traps of

optimism bias, perfectionism, or a need to prove their worth, all of

which skew their decision-making ability.

The real leadership skill is not ﬁguring out how to do it all; it’s knowing

when and how to push back. That’s where strategic refusal comes in.

Strategic refusal is a structured method to force prioritization and push

back on unrealistic demands that jeopardize team productivity, morale,

or well-being. The idea isn’t to avoid responsibility, but rather to protect

the team, maintain long-term performance, and ensure sustainable

outcomes—all while safeguarding your reputation.

Strategic refusal has two main components: a matrix to help you

determine when to act and a framework to guide you on how to act.
