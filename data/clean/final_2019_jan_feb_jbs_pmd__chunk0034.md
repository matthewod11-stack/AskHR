of 1970-1995. The study indicated that the size, growth, domestic saving, country’s solvency, trade.openness and macroeconomic stability variable are catalyst of FDI. The UNCTAD (1999) advocated both positive and negative association between growth and FDI ,depending upon the incorporation of various variable like infrastructure, market integration etc.

economies during 1960 to 1987 by using a model based on traditional derived –factor of a multiple product monopolist .The study finds that FDI inflow are more elastic with respect to cost of capital than wages and also more elastic with respect to aggregate demand in export than domestic demand.

DierkHerzer(2009) “Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of outward foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth. In this Two econometric approaches are used: cross-country regressions for a sample of 50 countries and time-series estimators for the USA and Both approaches tell the same story: outward FDI is positively associated with growth. This finding is robust to several model specifications, potential outliers, and different estimation techniques. In addition, Granger-causality tests for the USA indicate that causality is bidirectional, suggesting that increased outward FDI is both a cause and a consequence of increased domestic output. This paper, in contrast, deals with the effects of aggregate outward FDI on the economy as a whole.

Balasubramanyan et al. (1996) found significant positive association between FDI and economic growth and suggest that the above relationship is more holistic in the export promotion policy in contracts to import substitution policy of the country.

Sing and Jung (1996) argued that political risk,business, condition and macroeconomics policies matter for FDI in developing countries.

The above studies indicate mixed result and mostly provided information about determinants related to FDI inflow in SAARC Countries. Thus the review helped in choosing the factors or alternative that may gauge empirical analysis of determinates of FDI in SAARC.

The classical model for determinants Of FDI begins from the earlier research work of Dunning (1973, 1981) which provide a comprehensive analysis based on ownership, location and internationalization paradigm. Lucas (1993) examined the determinates of FDI inflow for select East and south Asian
