# Journals and Textbooks

The 1970s saw the development of the ﬁrst journals in law and psychology. The American Psychology-Law Society began publishing Law and Human Behavior, and the American Association of Correctional Psychologists devel- oped Criminal Justice and Behavior. They were joined by the Law and Psychology Review, then in the 1980s by Behavioral Sciences and the Law, and ﬁnally the APA’s new journal, Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, in the 1990s. Several new journals also appeared in Great Britain in the 1990s: Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health, Legal and Crimino- logical Psychology, and Psychology, Crime and Law.

One of the ﬁrst forensic psychology texts in this modern era of forensic psychology was Brodsky’s Psychologists in the Criminal Justice System (1973). Few texts in psychology and law were available until the American Psychology-Law Society developed a book series in the mid-1970s, but by the 1980s the ﬁeld had spawned enough texts to provide the ﬁeld with a body of recognized knowledge that began to forge the ﬁeld’s identity.
