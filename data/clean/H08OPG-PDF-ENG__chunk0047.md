## HBR / Digital Article / What Is the Office for Today?

the long-term culture and work community that will be required to

accomplish their organizations’ goals.

To close, one of the big questions we asked you in 2020 was: What is

an oﬃce for? How would you answer that question today?

My overall position on the role of the oﬃce hasn’t changed—the

physical environment has a unique role to play in enabling human work

and endeavor. I know, however, that I would answer this question a bit diﬀerently today than I did ﬁve years ago.

Something I came across during the pandemic comes to mind now.

The writing was from a British educator from the late 1800s and, to

paraphrase, it noted the importance for children to explore and play

outdoors in nature as means for learning. The text described a young

child picking up a pebble from a stream and observing it at length,

holding it in his wet hands, rubbing its smooth surface with his ﬁngers

—all the while, below his own awareness, drawing a connection between

the object of his focus and the cold water, the current around his ankles,

the sound of the rushing brook, etc. The author instructed that in future

years, when the child would be old enough to be taught the abstract

concept of “erosion,” he would pull from his memory the experience by the stream and form a qualitatively diﬀerent and richer relationship to

the idea of “erosion” than had he learned the formal concept alone.

Being the mother of a young child, the simple example struck a personal

note back then. And as a researcher, my work over the years has

repeatedly conﬁrmed the lasting validity of this idea. I think it’s fair to

say we’ve all had similar experiences at work, perhaps during a summer

internship or our ﬁrst jobs, when the concepts we had learned in a

classroom suddenly came to life when we experienced them “in the real

world,” as we commonly say, with others.
