## How to Hone the Skill of Strategic Editing

Strategic editing is the skill of adjusting your communication to match

your role. It’s not about withholding information; it’s about choosing

what’s most essential to say, how to say it, and when it’d be more eﬀective to say nothing at all. Here’s how:

- 1. Recognize that everything you say (or don’t say) carries weight.

Executive communication is always ampliﬁed. A passing comment can

redirect strategy. A sigh in a meeting can spark anxiety. That’s why

being intentional about what you communicate and how you deliver it

is critical for creating the impact you intend.

Practice being explicit about what you’re communicating and what you

do and don’t know:

- “I’m just thinking out loud right now…”

- “I have feedback from the board that I want to share and discuss. We’re

not going to make a decision today; I want to explore the issue with

you ﬁrst.”

- “I’ve had some ideas on ways to adjust our strategy that I’d like

to discuss with you. To be clear, I’m not saying this is a new

direction. Today I just want us to consider where we are, the shifting

environment, and what might make sense going forward.”

- “We had a tough quarter, and we may need to shift our go-to-market

strategy. I don’t know if that’s true yet, but I want to discuss it.”
