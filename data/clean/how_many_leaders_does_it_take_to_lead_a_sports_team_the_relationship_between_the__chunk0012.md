team’s cohesion and communication, and establishing a strong work ethic [2]. This effective leadership is, in turn, an important driver of the team’s functioning and effectiveness [3, 4]; that is, the team’s ability to develop adequate cognitive, motivational, affective and coordi- native processes [5].

Traditionally, leadership research has focused on the coach as formal leader of the team, guiding the team to optimal performance from a top-down, hierarchical perspective [6, 7]. However, leadership is not restrictive to the coach; players within the team can also take on important leadership roles, which is a phenomenon known as athlete leadership. Athlete lead- ership has been defined as “an athlete occupying a formal or informal role within a team, who influences a group of members to achieve a common goal” [8]. By taking on leadership roles, athlete leaders can exert significant influence on the group. To illustrate this, previous research has demonstrated how high-quality leaders fostered the intrinsic motivation of their team- mates [9], strengthened their team confidence and their team identification [10], while also instigating cohesion within the team [11], and ultimately improving team performance [12]. In short, leadership within the team is considered an important driver of sports success, or, in other words, of the team’s ability to achieve its goals [5].
