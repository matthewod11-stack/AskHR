# Equality Theory

movement (Stiglitz 2011) and some of its associated social theorists (Eisenstein 2011) draw a clear link between a global Ô¨Ånancial system that is increasingly dysfunctional, and the (presumptively) equity-driven practices (such as Wall Street salaries) that preponderate in many organiza- tions. And such pertains to spheres of distributive justice other than inequality of income. For example, a recent study found that Americans today experience a decreasing degree of opportunity for upward mobility (Isaacs et al. 2008) in comparison to the past.

Again mirroring a strand of thought presented in the opening pages, Maynard and Mehrtens (1996) note that many businesses are already shifting to focus more on serving the needs of stakeholders, including a greater focus on the social problems of distribution, rather than on pro- duction per se. Sen (1999) asserts that organizations can and should play a proactive role in leading social change. In this context, beyond adopting distributive practices to augment their internal effectiveness, organizations have an ethical obligation to construct and to engineer organiza- tions that more accurately mirror the justice processes they wish to see unfold within the larger society.
