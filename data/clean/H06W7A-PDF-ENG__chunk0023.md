Daniel: The standard way to build transparency is that the

technology can and does provide that auditing — and that audit

should itself be available to the patient whose information has been

disclosed. The more detailed audit, the more transparency.

Ron: So, let me get this straight … what transparency means is

that the patient has access to every single point of access to his or

her record. They have an electronic paper trail of who it was that

accessed their data, when they accessed their data, and where they

accessed their data.
