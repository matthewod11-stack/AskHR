Regarding the antecedents, an individual may perceive some leadership actions as reflecting or signaling the leaderâ€™s character and intentions and may perceive other actions as reflecting or signaling the type of relationship they have with the leader. Fol- lowing our earlier theorizing, although distributive justice likely does not signal the nature of the relationship, it may signal the tendency of a leader to be generally fair and act with integrity. In contrast, interactional justice may signal respect and caring in the relationship. The relationship for procedural justice is unclear: according to the group value model, procedural fairness demon- strates respect for the employee and a valuation of the relationship (Brockner & Siegel, 1996); procedural justice may also, however, signal that the leader is generally fair and acts with integrity as a matter of principle.

Hypothesis 7: Distributive justice will have a stronger rela- tionship with cognitive trust than overall trust; interactional justice will have a stronger relationship with overall trust.
