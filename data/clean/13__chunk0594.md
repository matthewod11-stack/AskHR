# (j) Afﬁrmative action.

Research reveals sub-cultural differences in stereotypes about people who are hired under afﬁrmative action programs (e.g., Evans, 2003; James, Brief, Dietz, & Cohen, 2001; Stanush, Arthur, & Doverspike, 1998). For instance, Anglo-Americans typically stereotype those who have been hired under such programs as less qualiﬁed for jobs than those who are not hired under the same programs (Evans, 2003; James et al., 2001). One explanation for this is that U.S. culture stresses that everyone should be treated equally in society, and no one should be given special treatment because it might provide them with a competitive advantage. Interestingly, however, research by Stanush et al. (1998) showed that relative to Anglo-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and African-Africans were less likely to negatively stereotype qualiﬁed candidates hired under afﬁrmative action policies. This ﬁnding suggests that relative to members of groups that have not experienced unfair discrimination, members of groups that have are less likely to stigmatize afﬁrmative action beneﬁciaries.

Attributes that are viewed positively at one point in time may be viewed more negatively at a later point in time and vice-versa. For example, in the 19th century women with large body sizes were viewed as attractive in the U.S. However, by the 21st century women
