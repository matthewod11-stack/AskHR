# on priorities.

- Wins and learnings reviews: Celebrate progress and reﬂect on

lessons after completing important milestones.

- One-on-one coaching: Prioritize regular leader–team member

touchpoints with the purpose of having a growth-oriented,

developmental conversation. Equally important are the peer-to-peer

coaching conversations where colleagues help each other with

expansive questions aimed at strengthening skills.

A supply chain team we worked with took time to acknowledge the

progress they were making on active listening. They gave encouraging

feedback to a team member who had previously been dominating

conversations and had practiced stepping back in meetings. This

encouraged him to continue the journey, propelling the team forward.
