## increasingly common. Gallup data ﬁnds that over 72% of U.S. employees

work in a matrixed organization to some extent, giving way to org charts

with dual reporting lines. The rise of cross-functional and project-based

work means workers may also answer to project leaders, regional heads, or client partners in addition to their oﬃcial managers.

Keeping one boss happy is tough enough. Add a second to the

mix and suddenly your job description includes extra, unanticipated

coordination and inﬂuencing. There’s no question that managing up to

multiple bosses isn’t easy. But the very things that make it challenging

— navigating diﬀerent communication styles, negotiating workloads,

building consensus — are exactly the skills that will set you apart in

your career now and in the future if you play it right.

So, what do you do when you’re caught between two leaders who don’t

talk? The answer isn’t cc’ing each of them on every email or throwing

up your hands and saying, “Both of you ﬁgure this out!” Here’s how to

create alignment while also getting the support and clarity you need.
