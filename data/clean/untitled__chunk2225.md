# Signs of Maturation

Among the early signs that a ﬁeld is beginning to mature is the emergence of professional organizations and publications that provide a source of intellectual support for the ﬁeld, the identiﬁcation of a speciﬁc knowledge domain that constitutes the ﬁeld, and the development of professional training pro- grams. The 1970s and 1980s saw signiﬁcant development in all of these areas for forensic psychology and for psychology and law.
