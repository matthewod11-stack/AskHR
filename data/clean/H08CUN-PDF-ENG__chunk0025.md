# Focus on common goals

As humans, we’re hardwired to focus on threats and negative events

more than positive ones. “Psychologists call this positive-negative

asymmetry, and it explains why even small negative events wield such

power,” according to Klotz. To mitigate this, he suggests amplifying

positive events. “Take the time to celebrate wins, acknowledge

accomplishments, and focus your team on a common goal,” he says.

This way, instead of looking inward and ﬁghting, the team’s attention

shifts outward toward the future. “It helps cleanse the negative vibes.”
