# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 231

Kraiger, 1995), and learning outcomes such as knowledge and skill acquisition and training transfer (Kraiger, Ford, & Salas, 1993).

Approaches to studying personality effects applied to training or learning contexts have already led to some advances in our un- derstanding of individual differences, learning processes, and learning outcomes. The recent push toward self-directed learning and blended instruction, integrating traditional and more self- directed learning activities (Bassi & Van Buren, 1999), will increase our need to understand how personality inï¬‚uences the choices that individuals make. Such decisions include how much effort to place into the program, how much and what type of training con- tent to focus on, and how many practice exercises to complete in the training in which they decide to pursue and engage.

It is clear that the intent and goals of effective learning expe- riences such as those in training are to change how learners per- ceive, think, plan, and behave. What is not as clear is the context in which these changes occur: for whom, how, and when.
