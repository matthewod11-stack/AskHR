As the parents of Beau and Bitty, we quickly learned that in the United

States and most other places around the world, people with disabilities,

particularly intellectual and developmental ones, are treated diﬀerently

from everyone else. Sure, charitable and advocacy organizations and

some K–12 school systems are working to shift that dynamic. But in

all the years we’ve spent fundraising for and blogging and speaking

publicly about this issue, it often feels as if we’re preaching to the choir.

The disability community remains a subculture disconnected from

mainstream society. Adults especially still struggle to integrate. And one

of the greatest obstacles they face is a lack of access to employment.
