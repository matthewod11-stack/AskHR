## TABLE 4 Presenter Recommendations to Trainees

Include time for questions at the end if possible. Make sure you plan how you will introduce yourself. Be conﬁdent but don’t brag. Talk about your experiences and training brieﬂy (less than 30 seconds) (e.g., “My name is Darlene Smith. I am a third-year PhD student in sport psychology at Michigan State University. I was the captain of the women’s soccer team at Penn State, as well as the assistant captain of the girls’ ﬁeld hockey team in high school”).

Plan out the priorities to cover in each session. Then know what you will cut out if you

don’t have enough time.

By all means keep it active. Lectures don’t work well with this group. Be enthusiastic. Bring positive energy. Ask questions. Get them engaged. If you bring

energy to them, they will give energy back.

Don’t be afraid to challenge them subtly and slightly if they are not participating. Do this in

a jovial manner, not a frustrated one (e.g., “Don’t raise your hands all at once!” ☺). Have fun. Remember that you are helping the state’s youth and if one person gets it, then

you have done our youth a great service.

Be sure to mention/refer to the student-athlete guide at least once during your presentation.

We have created this guidebook and want them to use it (e.g., “On page 8 of your guidebook, you can ﬁnd more information on effective communication skills”; or “The material we will be covering in this session is discussed in chapter 3 of your guidebook”). Don’t wait until the night before to prepare even if you have done the presentation before! A professional prepares completely even when he or she feels they have the presentation mastered. We promise you this—you can be sharper, even if you are a veteran.

The captains are most receptive when the presentations are conversational, when you make

the information relevant to them (e.g., by using illustrative examples), and when you connect with the group (vs. reading off the screen). These objectives are easier to achieve if you know the presentation information inside and out.

Remember, these presentations are not lectures! Try to get the group involved in some way for every PowerPoint slide you have (e.g., through questions, activities, etc.)—the more the captains participate, the more they will get out of the sessions.

Don’t be afraid to adjust during and/or between sessions. Understand that you are not going to reach, please, or entertain everyone, but it is a good idea to pay attention to what is working, what isn’t working, and make changes when necessary.

Be enthusiastic and model interest in the material. Try chatting with the captains before and between sessions. The more they get to know

you, the more likely they are to be involved once your presentation starts.
