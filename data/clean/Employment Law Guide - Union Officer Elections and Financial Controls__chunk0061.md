Form LM-10 (Employer). The LMRDA requires public disclosure of speciﬁc ﬁnancial transactions or

arrangements made between an employer and one or more of the following: a labor organization, union

oﬃcial, employee, or labor relations consultant. Every employer who has engaged in any such transaction or

arrangement during the ﬁscal year must ﬁle a detailed report with the Secretary of Labor within 90 days after

the end of the employer's ﬁscal year. An employer required to ﬁle must complete only one Form LM-10 each ﬁscal year that covers all instances of reportable activity even if activity occurs at multiple locations.

These reporting requirements only relate to the disclosure of speciﬁed payments. The reporting requirements

do not address whether speciﬁc payments, transactions, or arrangements are lawful or unlawful. The fact that

a particular payment, transaction, or arrangement is or is not required to be reported does not indicate

whether it is or is not subject to any legal prohibition.

The types of ﬁnancial transactions, arrangements, or expenditures which must be reported are set forth in

Form LM-10. The report must include the following: (1) the date of each arrangement and the date and

amount of each transaction; (2) the name, address, and position of the person with whom the agreement or

transaction was made; and (3) a full explanation of the circumstances of all payments made, including the

terms of any agreement or understanding pursuant to which they were made.

The completed Form LM-10 and any additional pages must be mailed to the following address:
