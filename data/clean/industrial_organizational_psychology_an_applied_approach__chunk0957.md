# Point-of-Purchase Methods

The point-of-purchase method of recruitment is based on the same “POP” (point- of-purchase) advertising principles used to market products to consumers. For

example, consider shopping at a local grocery store. As you push your cart through one aisle, you see a special display for potato chips, in the next aisle a display for cookies. When you get to the checkout stand, items such as the National Enquirer, candy, and batteries are conveniently placed so you can examine them while you wait in line. The idea is to get you to buy more items once you are already in the store.

In employee recruitment, job vacancy notices are posted in places where customers or current employees are likely to see them: store windows, bulletin boards, restaurant placemats, and the sides of trucks. The advantages to this method are that it is inexpensive and it is targeted toward people who frequent the business. The disadvantage is that only a limited number of people are exposed to the sign.

Cabela’s, a retail chain specializing in hunting and fishing goods, is an excel- lent example of an organization that recruits current customers for job openings. Because Cabela’s needs employees with extensive knowledge of hunting and fishing, they find it much easier to hire customers who already have that interest and knowledge, than to train new employees from scratch. In addition to targeting current customers, Cabela’s also lures hunting and fishing clubs whose members are not only potential employees, but potential customers as well. A perk that also helps recruit avid hunters and fishermen is product discounts and a policy that allows sales staff to take a product home for  days so that they can provide customers with accurate opinions about the product (Taylor, ).

Because of the difficulty in obtaining employees, many fast-food restaurants are using unusual point-of-purchase techniques. McDonald’s, Arby’s, Burger King, and Carl’s Jr. have all printed help-wanted ads with application blanks on their paper placemats. To apply for a job, customers (can we now call them McApplicants?) simply wipe the spilled ketchup off the placemat, fill in their name and address, and give the placemat to the manager. Examples of these are shown in Figure ..

Wendy’s has printed announcements of job openings on its cash-register receipts (“Now hiring smiling faces”), as does Target and Home Depot; Domino’s Pizza placed help-wanted ads on its pizza boxes; and Kentucky Fried Chicken placed signs on vans that stopped at student gathering places to distribute free sodas and application materials. Because Store  had difficulty recruiting manager trainees, it took the unique approach of placing a help-wanted adver- tisement on one side of its milk cartons. The cost of the recruitment campaign was minimal, as the company already bore the expense of creating and printing the milk cartons. Other examples of innovative recruitment methods include Lauriat’s Books placing a job posting and mini-résumé on a bookmark; the cloth- ing store Rugged Warehouse putting help-wanted signs in its dressing rooms; and both SmithKline and Prudential Insurance posting help-wanted ads on billboards in the Philadelphia area.

Recruiters Campus Recruiters Many organizations send recruiters to college campuses to answer questions about themselves and interview students for available positions. Not surprisingly, the behavior and attitude of recruiters can greatly influence applicants’ decisions to accept jobs that are offered (Chapman, Uggerslev, Carroll, Piasentin, & Jones, ; Rynes, Bretz, & Gerhart, ).
