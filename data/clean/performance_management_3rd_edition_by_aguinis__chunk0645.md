## Task and Contextual Performance at Sprint Nextel

Sprint Nextel (http://www.sprint.com) is a provider of local, wireless, long-distance voice, and voice- over IP services. The company is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. At Sprint Nextel, all employees are evaluated, and development plans are created through the use of five core competencies or “dimensions.” These dimensions include act with integrity, focus on the customer, deliver results, build relationships, and demonstrate leadership. The dimensions are used not only for business strategy and objectives but also as a template for what successful performance looks like at the company. These dimensions include the consideration of both task and contextual performance, and employees in the evaluation and development process are asked to write behavioral examples of how they have performed on each dimension. For example, the delivering results dimension clearly links to performing specific tasks of one’s job. Each employee has certain tasks to complete on a regular basis to keep the business moving. On the other hand, the company is concerned about how the work gets done and contributing to a good work environment that allows greater effectiveness. This is apparent through the dimensions that look at how employees develop relationships with others and act with integrity in their day-to-day functioning. In summary, Sprint Nextel has recognized the importance of considering both task and contextual components of a job in its performance management system. Employees are evaluated not only on results but also on how they are achieved through working with others.19

emphasize the measurement of behaviors. For example, consider a situation involving two assembly-line workers, one of them working the day shift and the other the night shift. When the assembly line gets stuck because of technical problems, the employee working during the day receives immediate technical assistance, so the assembly line is back in motion in less than five minutes. By con- trast, the employee working the night shift has very little technical support and, therefore, when the assembly line breaks down, it takes about 45 minutes for it to be up and running again. If we measured results, we would conclude that the performance of the day-shift employee is far superior to that of the night-shift employee, but this would be an incorrect conclusion. Both employees may be equally competent and do the job equally well. The results produced by these employees are uneven because they depend on the amount and quality of technical assistance they receive when the assembly line is stuck.

We discuss the specific steps involved in measuring behaviors in Chapter 5. Next,

let’s discuss the results approach to measuring performance.
