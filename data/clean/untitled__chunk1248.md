# The Institutes of Child Development

Reﬂecting societal concerns about ways to improve the rearing of children, a number of research institutes were

established around the United States, including those at the University of Iowa, the University of Minnesota, Teachers College at Columbia, Yale, and the University of California, Berkeley. The goals of these new institutes were research, teaching, and dissemination. The programs were modeled after research stations. As Mrs. CoraBusseyHillis, anearlysupporterof theseactivities, envisioned,“ifresearchcouldimprovecornandhogs,itcould improve children” (Sears, 1975, p. 19).
