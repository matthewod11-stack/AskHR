# 208 Developmental Psychology

Limited, too, was their understanding of their own cul- ture. Contemporary developmental psychologists recognize that societal conditions in a variety of spheres—medical, ed- ucation, economic, political, and social—inﬂuence both development itself and research and theory about develop- ment. They have seen how historical conditions can shape choices of problems and theoretical interpretations. The most celebrated example, of course, is the inﬂuence of Victorian Vienna on psychoanalysis (Lerner, 1986). The repressive views concerning sex and sexuality held by European soci- ety in the early 1900s quite clearly contributed to the symp- toms exhibited by Freud’s patients and the focus on sexual feelings and processes in Freud’s theory. However, Freud himself and the other early theorists showed little awareness of the need to acknowledge the role of societal and historical inﬂuences in their theories of development.

Asanemergingdiscipline,notsurprisingly,developmental psychology was also an interdisciplinary enterprise.The early theorists looked to philosophy, biology, pedagogy, and sociol- ogy for ideas. Hall was particularly inﬂuenced by philoso- phy, religion, education, and evolutionary biology. Baldwin reached out to religion. Freud incorporated anthropology. At the same time, there was a strong push to disassociate the emerging ﬁeld from its roots—especially its philosophical roots—and to establish the new ﬁeld as a separate discipline, especially a scientiﬁc one. Baldwin’s theories as well as Binet’s experimental demonstrations represented clear depar- tures from the introspectionist approach of the past.

In brief, by 1914, American psychology had become established as an independent discipline, developmental psy- chology as a separate science was beginning to emerge, and themajorthemesofdevelopmentthatoccupiedusforthenext century were being deﬁned. In the next phase, the institution- alization of developmental psychology as a distinctive sub- ﬁeld within mainstream psychology began.

A PERIOD OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND FRAGMENTATION (1915–1940)

Two major themes characterize the next period in the history of developmental psychology. First, this was a period of establishment of major research institutes. Second, it was an era both of extraordinary theoretical and empirical advances in developmental psychology and of multiple voices and rau- cous cacophony.
