# APL BPL

126 361

2.1865 3.6958

.47824 .58002

.04261 .03053

Source: Survey Data From the results it can be found that the means of BPL(Below Poverty Line)and APL(Above Poverty Line) are 3.7 and 2.19 respectively and SDs are .48 and .58 . There is significant difference between the group

performances of APL( M=2.19, SD= .49) and BPL (M= 3.7,SD = .59) conditions t (485) = 26.254. This sho ws that there is significant association between social status and group performance. Hence null hypothesis is rejected.
