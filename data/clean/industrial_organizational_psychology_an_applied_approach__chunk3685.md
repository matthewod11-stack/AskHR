Place a dollar amount on your time and then determine if any activity is worth the money. For example, if you value your time at $100 per hour and you spend 30 minutes each morning gossiping with a coworker, ask yourself, “Was the conversa- tion worth $50?” If the answer is no, the conversa- tion was a time waster.
