# Individual Lives and Individual Differences: The Multidisciplinary Study of Personality (1900–1930) 183

histories based on their investigations of clients and their families. Psychologists’ role in these interdisciplinary teams “generally came down to the construction and application of scales that would subject ‘personality’ to the rigors of mea- surement and so convert it from merely an object of social in- tervention to an object of science” (Danziger, 1990, p. 164). The movement thus supported psychologists as purveyors of expert scientiﬁc knowledge of personality in the form of test scores.

G. Stanley Hall’s Adolescence (1904), which was illustrated with quotations from autobi- ographies, literature, and answers to questionnaires, drew similar criticism. “Dr. Hall is as much an artist as a scientist,” commented one reviewer, adding, “It is to be regretted that much of the questionnaire data . . . has not been secured or tabulated according to the most approved statistical and scientiﬁc methods” (Kirkpatrick, 1904, p. 692).
