# gap

As noted in chapter 1.2, factors explaining people’s propensity to perceive gender inequality and the gender pay gap have not received much attention in the literature. Therefore, two of the objectives of this thesis are to identify factors that explain individuals’ and employees’ perceptions of gender inequality and the gender pay gap. These objectives are addressed in the first three thesis papers. Tables 1 depicts all factors, which were under investigation in those papers, and which were theoretically suggested to have an impact on individuals’ and employees’ perceptions of gender inequality and the gender pay gap.
