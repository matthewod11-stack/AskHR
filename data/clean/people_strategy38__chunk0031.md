Risk-avoiding Spend a lot of energy to avoid making mistakes

Risk-taking Are nto afraid to make mistakes when the potential payoff is large enough

findings reveal, as one might expect, that employees perceive greater opportunity for fulfillment when orga- nizations distribute decision-making authority widely rather than concentrating it in a few places. But the shift toward more distributed authority was smaller than might be expected—about half the magnitude of the shift toward a people-centric culture, for example (see Exhibit 3).

Do people actually value a certain amount

of central authority? We observed this phe- nomenon in our work for a Fortune 50 com- pany with an array of business units. When the top 200 managers across the organization were asked to identify the company’s most sig- nificant unrealized opportunity, many pointed to the difficulty of coordination across decen- tralized business units. This statement was typ- ical: “As a highly decentralized company we are not proficient at sharing information. Our systems are fragmented.” Another manager pointed out the strain associated with the problem: “Information shar- ing is a huge challenge. Unfortunately, this has become an after-hours, extra-effort endeavor, putting pressure on all of the regular work that has to get done.”

Judicious centralization of supporting activities—for example, customer information sharing, talent mobility, and collaborative innovation—reduces wasteful and stressful effort and improves the potential for work-related fulfillment. Burdensome centralization that slows decisions and impedes work efforts does the opposite.

In cultures that have adopted employee autonomy as a closely held norm, the manager role looks different from its conventional shape in most organizations.

In our culture analysis, employees said that opportunity for fulfillment would increase with a small move away from what is currently perceived as an individualistic cultural norm and toward a climate with greater emphasis on teamwork. This finding aligns with the well-understood importance of social support as a buffer against stress. According to 2014 data from the American Psychological Association, people who say they receive emotional support put their overall stress levels at 4.8 on a 1 to10 scale. In comparison, people who say they lack emotional sustenance gave themselves a 6.2 rating.

Managing the Work Side Exhibit 4 shows the relative magnitude and direction of change that employees believe would help make the work- side elements of the average organizational culture more conducive to high fulfillment.

As with the human-side cultural elements, these changes are individually small. Taken together, however, they repre- sent an important cultural shift in favor of employee and or- ganizational health. Exhibit 5 presents scenarios that reflect different situations on each of the five elements of work-side culture.

In each case, the most radical version of Scenario A would increase stress for most employees. Situations approximating the Scenario B examples, in contrast, would engender a more fulfilling work environment. Again, these are constructed to be stark examples—most work cultures will fall somewhere in the middle, and that is where employees are most com- fortable. Nevertheless, our survey suggests that work climates more like the Scenario B examples—less immediate pressure, more opportunity for creativity, less dedication to historical process, less attachment to quantitative analysis, and risk avoidance—are more compatible with increased productive energy and lower stress.

Manager skill at calibrating work challenge has a signifi- cant effect on how employees perceive the work side of orga- nizational culture. Managers deemed effective at helping to move workplace culture in the direction of greater fulfillment got high scores from employees for how well they: • Negotiate reasonable project time lines • Remove obstacles to doing jobs well • Involve people in the scheduling of their work • Encourage new ideas and new ways of doing things

Similarly, the degree to which managers succeed at en- couraging and enabling worker autonomy goes a long way toward determining whether the work side of culture is more stressful or more fulfilling. In cultures that have adopted employee autonomy as a closely held norm, the manager role
