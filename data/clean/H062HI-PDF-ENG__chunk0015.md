## count the boost to productivity, engagement, morale, and ﬁrm reputation

that can come with a paid leave policy, too.

Talk to your employees. “I think executives really need to listen to the

feedback they receive from their staff,” Sias insisted, “you really truly have

to have a plan of action on how you’re going to address what those [pain]

points are. And if it’s … leave and beneﬁts, do them. It’s the low-hanging

fruit, and it goes such a distance. Staff feel heard. Staff feel appreciated.

Staff feel acknowledged…and if you’ve missed it, you’ve lost their trust.” If

you just listen but don’t act on their feedback or explain why you can’t,

they won’t believe you care, and they won’t trust you.

Include men. Paid leave policies shouldn’t be reserved just for women.

Todd Olson, founder and CEO of Pendo, a software services ﬁrm in

Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, pointed out that making their paid parental leave available to all parents has been key to maintaining a diverse talent pool: “Supporting men also helps women get back to work, if that’s

what they choose to do.”

Plan handoffs in advance. The work goes on, even while employees are on leave. Plan ahead and get buy-in from those who will be covering

projects and tasks. The new team might need to be trained or brought up

to speed, too. Dan Najjum, CFO at edtech ﬁrm Signal Vine in Alexandria,

Virginia, said it’s not hard, but is important: “With enough time and

planning, you can ﬁgure out how this can be done….You want your

coworkers to care about each other.” If you don’t plan ahead, you risk

resentment that can backﬁre, or the work may be done improperly, which

could have seriously deleterious effects on your business.
