The second key assumption when using cross-sectional data to consider effects associated with time is that characteristics of the hiring process (or internal selection or turnover processes) remained stable over time. If this is not true, speciﬁcation error may cause variables to appear to have an if the hiring process has changed, interaction with time. For example, resulting in employees with a different distribution of characteristics than those hired earlier, other correlated characteristics may falsely appear to be signiﬁcant if the model is not appropriately speciﬁed. Researchers can try to minimize this risk by having well-developed theoretical models which identify the variables to be measured and by ruling out alternative explanations for their ﬁndings. Nonetheless, this is a concern that in all likelihood cannot be fully mitigated.

Despite these limitations, though, cross-sectional research can play an important role for considering dynamic phenomena. Any longitudinal model of job performance that can be used to make predictions about job performance over time should also have implications if a ‘‘snap-shot’’ of the
