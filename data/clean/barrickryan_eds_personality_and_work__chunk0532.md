## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 159

dividual has much choice whether to engage in the behaviors as- sociated with a particular neurotransmitter.

In such cases, a given personality trait, as a reﬂection of an un- derlying biological state, should have a direct effect on behavior because its inﬂuence is for the most part unmediated by any choice behavior on the part of the individual coworkers. Although per- sonality traits can be considered direct determinants of counter- productive behaviors in these extreme cases, we hypothesize that these occasions will be somewhat rare. In most cases, we expect personality traits to exert their inﬂuence on counterproductive be- haviors indirectly, through their effect on either our attitudes to- ward various counterproductive behaviors or general workplace attitudes or moods. Indeed, when individuals possess extreme lev- els of a neurotransmitter that regulates a given personality trait, the population under consideration may no longer be a “normal” population of adults. For instance, many of these individuals may satisfy the clinical criteria for a particular personality disorder. In- dividuals who are very high on neuroticism may satisfy many of the diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder, including vulnerability, anxiety, and depression. Similarly, individuals who are very high on the Conscientiousness dimension may satisfy many of the criteria for obsessive personality disorder, such as a preoccupation with order and perfectionism (Widiger, Verheul, & van den Brink, 1999).

Research into the links between biology and personality is in its infancy. The important point for the purpose of this chapter is that in an as yet undetermined number of cases, counterproduc- tive behaviors at work may in fact be manifestations of clinical dis- orders that have their origins in biological systems. The extent to which this is true has not yet been adequately addressed.
