The comment triggered a moment of introspection for Paul. He realized

that his approach, meant to demonstrate openness and a desire to

learn, might cast shadows on his perceived experience and authority.

Recalling similar reactions at various gatherings, Paul confronted a

paradox: Could his learning mentality, while enriching his knowledge,

inadvertently diminish his stature in the eyes of his peers?

Although it’s widely accepted that good leaders are good learners, a

learning mentality can also have a darker side. If not carefully managed, it might lead to a perception of decreased eﬀectiveness, less expertise, and lower eﬃciency.

The results of Paul’s 360-degree feedback provided the conﬁrmation he

needed to realize that his learning mindset, although well intentioned,

had cemented a perception of a person who was indecisive, passive

aggressive, and less competent. When I asked his stakeholders what that

looked like, the answer was unanimous: He asks too many questions.

So, how can you keep your learning mentality from getting in the way of

your growth and tarnishing others’ perception of you?
