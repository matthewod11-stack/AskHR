## HBR / Magazine Article / The Feedback Fallacy

You can do the same. Whenever you see one of your people do

something that worked for you, that rocked your world just a little, stop

for a minute and highlight it. By helping your team member recognize

what excellence looks like for her—by saying, “That! Yes, that!”—you’re

oﬀering her the chance to gain an insight; you’re highlighting a pattern

that is already there within her so that she can recognize it, anchor it,

re-create it, and reﬁne it. That is learning.

Replay your instinctive reactions. Unlike Landry, you’re not going to

be able to videotape your people. Instead, learn how to replay to them

your own personal reactions. The key is not to tell someone how well

she’s performed or how good she is. While simple praise isn’t a bad

thing, you are by no means the authority on what objectively good

performance is, and instinctively she knows this. Instead, describe what

you experienced when her moment of excellence caught your attention.

There’s nothing more believable and more authoritative than sharing

what you saw from her and how it made you feel. Use phrases such as

“This is how that came across for me,” or “This is what that made me

think,” or even just “Did you see what you did there?” Those are your

reactions—they are your truth—and when you relay them in speciﬁc

detail, you aren’t judging or rating or ﬁxing her; you’re simply reﬂecting

to her the unique “dent” she just made in the world, as seen through

your eyes. And precisely because it isn’t a judgment or a rating it is at
