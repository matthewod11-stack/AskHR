provided greater motivation to do better, and more. We also ran studies

to determine if these perceptions changed when reviews were positive

or more negative or whether they were tied to monetary gains, like

bonuses. Finally, we ran an experiment asking participants to actually

complete a task — providing customer support to a complaining client

at a made-up furniture company — and gave them feedback in one of

the three formats based on their performance.
