# Model (ETA Model)

The components of the competency models created by ETA and enterprises are predictable with the writing that depicts competency models. Rothwell (2002) clarifies that there are center abilities that are expected everything being equal. This would incorporate learning, aptitudes and capacities (usually alluded to as KSAs), just as delicate abilities or practices ( Lucia & Lepsinger, 1999; and Rodriguez, Patel, Bright, Gregory, & Gowing, 2002). The center abilities or aptitudes are comparable crosswise over occupations and are expected of numerous occupations.
