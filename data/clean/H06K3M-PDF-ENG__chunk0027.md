# experiment group.

While still a work in progress, Uber’s experiments are showing that

it takes both information and enablement to combat collaborative

overload. Insights are necessary to provide employees with the context

for action, but are not suﬃcient by themselves because they don’t

provide a channel for action. Speciﬁc interventions — such as focus time applications and workspace design — can enable more eﬀective

collaboration, but employees may not utilize them fully if they don’t

understand the context behind why they are important. It takes both tools and context to make a real diﬀerence.
