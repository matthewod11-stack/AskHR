Not everyone on the SVP’s team welcomed these style shifts. After all, it

As you experiment with new leadership styles, don’t be discouraged if

some just never feel right. Stay open to practicing across styles so you

to choosing your approach based on purpose rather than personal

preference. This not only increases your leadership eﬀectiveness in a

given context, but it ensures you’re actively growing your adaptability
