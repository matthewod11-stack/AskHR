# Negative Feedback and Failure

Happy workers are more likely to feel self-conﬁdent and persist in their efforts, even in the face of failure. Jobs vary in the extent to which individuals are likely to experience failure or receive negative feedback. For jobs where such feedback is frequent, happy workers may be more resilient and persistent than unhappy workers. For ex- ample, trial lawyers regularly face situations that have a clear winner and a clear loser. Lawyers who can persist in spite of the potential for failure and the actual experience of failure will be more likely to succeed in the future. Whenever jobs have the potential for frequent experience of failure or negative feedback, happy workers may have an advantage over unhappy ones. Where there is little of this feed- back, happiness and self-conﬁdence may have little beneﬁt.
