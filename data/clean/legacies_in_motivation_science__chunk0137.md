alties for failure to attain them. Impossible goals can motivate in the short run if people try hard to attain them. In ﬁeld settings, impossible-to- attain goals can lead to demoralization and pun- ishment. In organizations, goals should be chal- lenging yet attainable.

Inductive theory building re- quires evidence of generality. Although we had no formal theory of induction when we began our research, we reported evidence of generality across tasks (n (cid:3) 88), participants (n (cid:2) 40,000), countries (n (cid:3) 7), outcome measures (n (cid:3) 10), and time spans ranging from 1 min to several years,5 designs (experimental, correlational), settings (laboratory, simulation, ﬁeld), and goal sources (assigned, self-set, participatively set). Studies also showed that goal setting could be used successfully with groups/teams, divisions, and even small organizations (e.g., Porter & Latham, 2013; Pritchard, Young, Koenig, Sch- merling, & Dixon, 2013).
