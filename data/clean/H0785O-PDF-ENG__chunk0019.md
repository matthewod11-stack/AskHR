In 1922 leadership was the province of the few. In 2022 we believe

that anyone who wants to become a good leader can do so with the

right kind of guidance. Perhaps what we’re still talking about is the

“better theoretical basis for executive action” that Wallace B. Donham

envisioned 100 years ago. Providing that essential insight is still what

drives us. And we hope it continues to inspire you.
