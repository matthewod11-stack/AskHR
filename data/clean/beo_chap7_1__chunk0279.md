The defining feature of the “deviations from baseline rationality” approach is that

it is organized around observed patterns of economic action that fall short of some

plausible standard of efficiency. People are found to exhibit a consistent tendency

to act in some way that “leaves money (or utility) on the table.” For example, they

underestimate the probabilities of events that did not occur (examples of this type are

collected as “hindsight bias”). Indeed, from this viewpoint, observed deviations are

often characterized as “mistakes.” The term implies that psychological processes are

being assessed for their adequacy in meeting the demands of economic rationality.

In the second approach, it is the problem of economic research to accurately

model action generated by normal psychological processes. Though psychological

accuracy would seem to be a valuable goal, the risk of this approach is that psy-

chologically rich models may lose contact with the powerful theoretical machinery

developed over the last century that allows economists to infer outcomes for groups
