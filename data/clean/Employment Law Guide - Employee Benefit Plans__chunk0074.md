## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

Part 5 of Title I states that the provisions of ERISA Titles I and IV supersede state and local laws which "relate

to" an employee beneﬁt plan. ERISA, however, does not preempt certain state and local insurance, banking or

securities laws, including state insurance regulation of multiple employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs).

MEWAs generally constitute employee welfare beneﬁt plans or other arrangements providing welfare beneﬁts to employees of more than one employer, not pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.
