Not everyone on the SVP’s team welcomed these style shifts. After all, it

meant more work and personal accountability. But he continued to seek

Commit to developing versatility over mastery.

As you experiment with new leadership styles, don’t be discouraged if

some just never feel right. Stay open to practicing across styles so you

have access to more choices when the moment calls for it. And commit

to choosing your approach based on purpose rather than personal

preference. This not only increases your leadership eﬀectiveness in a

given context, but it ensures you’re actively growing your adaptability
