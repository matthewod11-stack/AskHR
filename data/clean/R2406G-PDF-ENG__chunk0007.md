and most proﬁtable outcome of the emerging AI boom—but only for

companies that make it a strategic focus.

Unfortunately, most companies lack a clear understanding of what

great personalization should look like. We attempt to remedy that

problem in this article. Drawing on decades of work consulting on the

personalization eﬀorts of hundreds of large companies, we have built

measures how well companies deliver on the promises they implicitly

make to customers when they personalize an interaction.
