In the same study, when people asked for feedback well beforethey had finished a project, their main motivation was to maketheir work better. As a result, the constructive feedback they weregiven was more impactful because it encouraged collaboration,learning, and inclusion. In summary, asking for feedback ahead oftime is better for everyone.

The sweet spot for asking for feedback is when your work —whether it is a project, a presentation, or something else — isabout 50% to 60% complete, according to Dan Heath, the authorof

Upstream: The Quest to Solve Problems Before They Happen.“I think a lot of writers make the mistake of getting 90% of theway there, and then they start asking for feedback,” Heath

told me

in a recent interview. “And at that point, if you get negativefeedback, you can’t afford to take it on. Your instinct is going to beto push back and think, ‘Oh, well that’s just nit-picking,’ or, ‘I can’tafford to revisit that.’”“Asking for feedback earlier in the process gives you the mentalspace to really re-think, if necessary,” Heath explained.At work, asking your boss or peers for feedback earlier willdemonstrate your willingness to adapt. More importantly, it willprovide you with the opportunity to learn — to genuinelyconsider and implement suggestions that can elevate your workbefore you complete it. This process will ultimately make yourwork stronger, and in turn, you’re likely to receive less negativefeedback once you do turn it in.
