## Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) as a Single-item Measure of Employee…

NPS as a poor predictor of customer loyalty and customer satisfaction17. Perhaps, the harshest words were used by Sharp, who called Reichheld’s work a snake oil and fake science18. In other articles, it was pointed out that there was no consider- ation of research bias during NPS development19. Among other criticism we may find that the NPS is focused on the user, not exactly a person who make buying decision20.

An important factor we should keep in mind is the influence of national culture on the NPS. Originally the indicator was developed in the USA. Americans are the na- tion of optimists and for example Europeans are more modest in describing the positive view of something21. There are opinions that in Europe, the NPS should be measured differently and those who gave 10 and 9 but also 8 should be promoters and detractors should be limited only to those who gave 5 or less on the scale22.
