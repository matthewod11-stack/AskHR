## Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) and Employee Satisfaction

In the literature there is not much written about the Employee Net Promotor Score (eNPS)23. What we know for sure is that the idea behind the eNPS is to ask employ- ees how likely they would recommend their company as an employer. The meas- urement method, the definition of detractors and promoter remains the same24.
