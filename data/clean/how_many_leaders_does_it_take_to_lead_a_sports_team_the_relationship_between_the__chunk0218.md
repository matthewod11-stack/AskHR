## Athlete Leadership and Team Effectiveness

= 4.48, p < .001; partial η2 = .12) and female teams (Wilk’s Λ = .55, F(27,575.98) = 4.76, p < .001; partial η2 = .18). More specifically, both in male and female teams, teams with a high number of task leaders showed the highest team effectiveness. More specifically, for female teams, Bon- ferroni post-hoc analysis revealed that teams with three task leaders scored significantly better on all the outcome variables compared to teams with two task leaders (except for role clarity, role conflict and social cohesion), compared to teams with one leader (except for social cohe- sion), and teams with no task leaders (except for social cohesion). Likewise, in male teams, teams with two task leaders perceived their performance to be better than that of teams with one or zero leaders.

Social leaders. Second, regarding the number of social leaders, the results revealed signifi-

cant differences for female (Wilk’s Λ = .71, F(18,608.00) = 6.38, p < .001; partial η2 = .16) and male teams (Wilk’s Λ = .74, F(18, 396.00) = 3.55, p < .001; partial η2 = .14). For female teams, it was better to have one or two social leaders; in contrast, male teams showed higher team effec- tiveness when having one or zero social leaders. Bonferroni post-hoc analysis revealed that female teams with two social leaders showed a stronger social cohesion compared with teams with one or zero leaders, and less relationship conflict compared with teams with zero leaders. In contrast, in male teams, only social cohesion was reported to be significantly better in teams with two social leaders compared to teams with one social leader.

External leaders. Third, regarding the most optimal number of external leaders, our find- ings yielded significant differences for female (Wilk’s Λ = .71, F(18,396.00) = 4.02, p < .001; par- tial η2 = .15) and male teams (Wilk’s Λ = .78, F(18,608.00) = 4.43, p < .001; partial η2 = .12). Male teams achieved better team effectiveness when having two external leaders, whereas female teams obtained better results with only one external leader. Specifically, Bonferroni post-hoc analyses revealed that male teams with two external leaders reported less relationship conflict compared to teams with zero leaders, and higher task cohesion, social cohesion, and intention to continue compared to teams having only one external leader. In contrast, female teams with two external leaders reported higher role conflict and lower collective efficacy and intention to continue than teams having only one external leader.
