# academic and practical work of others.

Along the way, we learned that friction can be both bad and

good: Not everything ought to be quick, easy, and frictionless.

Activities that involve good friction include developing deep and

trusting relationships, making complex and irreversible decisions under uncertainty, and doing creative work that’s messy, ineﬃcient, and

failure-ridden (if you’re doing it right!). Skilled leaders are bent on

eliminating unnecessary obstacles, in large part because doing so gives

them more time to focus on those many things in organizational life

that should be slow, hard, and complicated.

In this article we focus on addition sickness: the unnecessary rules,

procedures, communications, tools, and roles that seem to inexorably

grow, stiﬂing productivity and creativity. We show why companies are prone to this aﬄiction and how leaders can treat it. The ﬁrst step is to

do a good-riddance review to identify obstacles that can and should be

removed. The next step is to employ subtraction tools to eliminate those obstacles or make it diﬃcult for people to add them in the ﬁrst place.

This article unpacks both steps.
