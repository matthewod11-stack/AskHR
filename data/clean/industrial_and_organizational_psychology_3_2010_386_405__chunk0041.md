other. The rigor of a strong paradigm pro- vides a framework around which to build systematic research programs grounded in cumulative knowledge. At the same time, thestrong paradigmnarrows theperspective on a problem in ways that may miss expla- nations that fall outside the paradigmatic framework. JDM provides the paradigm and rigor, and the IOOB approach provides that breadth that is likely to avoid some of the problems of a narrow focus. The two approaches complement each other.

Susan Mohammed: Dan referred to the tight paradigm that characterizes decision- making research. With its applied focus, IOOB research tends to gravitate toward the context of the decision: decision making under stress, decision making under time pressure, decision making under uncer- tainty and ambiguity, and the emotional aspects of decision making. When one expands the research question by adding contextual effects, one gets away from the JDM paradigm that is a tight internally valid experiment. To illustrate, the naturalistic decision-making movement (Pliske & Klein, 2003) has broad research questions that talk about decision-making more descrip- tively, incorporating different variables and different ways of testing relationships. The NDM movement is closer to IOOB (than traditional JDM) from a philosophical stand- point, but the methods to test these bigger questions are still being developed.

Clearly, the tight, internally valid exper- imental design characterizing JDM stud- ies contributes to systematic, program- matic research, which tends to produce a well-accepted paradigm that can quickly launch and maintain productive areas of research. However, too much homogene- ity in methodology can limit the pursuit of ideas that do not ﬁt the dominant experi- mental design, leading to an empirical rut the more macro, over time. contextual orientation of IOOB naturally expands to a variety of samples, tasks, and research approaches. Nevertheless, diver- sity in methodologies and designs can make it difﬁcult to compare and contrast among empirical ﬁndings. The failure to establish
