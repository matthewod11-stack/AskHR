# Study Purpose

Most of the research on EHM best practices to date has been based on cross-sectional comparisons of companies or on case stud- ies of high-performance companies with EHM programs that have employed best practices components. Most such studies offer sup- port for the merits of using many best practices components, but they provide limited insight into whether these components perform consistently or differently relative to the attributes of the workforce. Furthermore, outcomes of interest in best practices research have been either company-level or individual-level comparisons but have seldom been considered together in analytic models. Also, although several studies suggest that components such as leadership support and the use of incentives are important,27,28,35 there is less empir- ical support for how other best practices such as the use of well- ness champions or biometric screenings relate to improved program outcomes.

This study seeks to advance the development and predictive value of EHM best practices guidelines by examining best practices components in the context of both company-level and individual- level outcomes. We hypothesize that best practice components will have signiﬁcantly different impacts on both the population and indi- vidualemployeesbasedonemployeeattributesofage,sex,andhealth status. We also hypothesize that current recommended best practices components will have varying degrees of inﬂuence on different lev- els of engagement including program enrollment, participation, and successful health behavior change. To test these hypotheses, this study used commonly accepted deﬁnitions of best practices compo- nents for company EHM programs and examined the inﬂuence of each component on registration into a telephone-based health coach- ing program, ongoing participation in the telephone-based program, and health behavior change.
