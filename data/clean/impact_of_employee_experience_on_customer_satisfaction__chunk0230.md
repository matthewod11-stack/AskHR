In quadrant 1 (Strongly agree) Q11: “I am proud to work in Atlas Copco Group” and

(Strongly agree) Q25: “I feel satisfied with the recognition or praise I receive for my

work” shows 26 of 105 datapoints which correspond to 24,7%.

Adding a regression analysis into this model: cumulatively, the drivers in this model

explain a moderate proportion of I feel satisfied with the recognition or praise I

receive for my work. This statement is based off of r-squared: the researcher consider

an r-squared between 20% and 45% to be fairly typical for this survey research,

indicating that the model is good enough to base a decision off of R-squared = 26.2%

Relative Importance is a modern extension of regression that calculates the proportion

of the r-squared contributed by each driver in the model. It accounts for situations

where the input variables are correlated with one another, a very common issue in

survey research (known as "multicollinearity")
