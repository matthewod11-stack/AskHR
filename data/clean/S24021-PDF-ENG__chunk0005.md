# slower growth.

While sustained proﬁtable growth is a nearly universal goal, it is

an elusive one for many companies. Empirical research that I and

others have conducted on the long-term patterns of growth in U.S.

corporations suggests that when inﬂation is taken into account, most

companies barely grow. For instance, in an analysis of 10,897 publicly

held U.S. companies from 1976 to 2019, my research associate Catherine

Piner and I found that ﬁrms in the top quartile grew at an inﬂation-

adjusted average of 11.8% per year, but those in the lower three

quartiles experienced little or no growth (0.3%, 0.03%, and -0.5%,

respectively). And the majority of ﬁrms in the top quartile were unable

to sustain superior growth performance for more than a few years.

Although challenging to achieve, sustained proﬁtable growth is not

impossible, however. In our analysis, we found that only about 15% of

the companies in the top growth quartile in 1985 were able to sustain
