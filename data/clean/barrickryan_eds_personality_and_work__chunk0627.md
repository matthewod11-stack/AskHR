## SELF-MONITORING PERSONALITY AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS 207

tained, or broken. According to social exchange theory (Blau, 1974; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959), relationships are built as a way of obtaining something of value from another person—a means to an end—in exchange for something offered to the other party. Re- search on the afﬁliation motive has shown that people prefer to af- ﬁliate with similar others, especially when they face uncertainty (Schachter, 1959). The social comparison motive proposes that af- ﬁliation choices are particularly important in situations where there is no objective standard against which to compare abilities, opinions, or behaviors (Festinger, 1954). Relationships are also used for purposes of status enhancement and self-validation (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000)—essentially, of presenting the self in the best possible light according to personal values.

Answering the deeper question of what people want from re- lationships is a way of understanding why they are formed. It is a way of understanding motive. In considering the motives of indi- viduals, it is apparent that individual differences at least partially guide what is desired from relationships. People do not all want the same thing from their relationships, and their desires are shaped by various individual motives.
