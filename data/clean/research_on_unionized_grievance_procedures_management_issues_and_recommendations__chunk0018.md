# Sociological Research

From this research, it is relatively clear that younger, male, more educated, and more skilled employees are most likely to file grievances; considerate or democratic supervision is associated with lower grievance filing rates; and employee complaints to shop stewards are a harbinger of formal grievance filing.

A second stream of research has focused on properties of work groups, organization struc- ture, technology, and the environment associ- ated with grievance procedure dynamics. For example, Weiss (1957) studied grievance fil- ing as a function of the degree of centraliza- tion of organizational authority. His main hypothesis was that decentralized organiza- tions experience a significantly lower level of grievance activity than centralized organiza- tions; however, Weiss was unable to confirm this hypothesis in his empirical work.

The role of technology in grievance activ- ity has been an important area of research. Sayles (1958) hypothesized that grievance rates vary from group to group depending on the social system of the group, especially as that system is influenced by technology. He examined 300 work groups across numerous plants and found grievance activity to be high- est in “strategic” (semi-skilled) work groups, lowest in “apathetic” (unskilled) work groups, and moderate in “erratic” (semi-skilled) and “conservative” (skilled) work groups.

Ronan (1963) attempted to build on Sayles’ findings by analyzing formal grievance activity in two plants of a single firm. He was unable to replicate Sayles’ findings, but this may have been due to his having collapsed the four work groups types into two categories. In addition, one of the two plants he studied was very new, and this may well have contributed to the relatively high level of grievances filed there. In a later study, Nelson (1979) was able to corroborate Sayles’ findings using a sample of 53 work groups in a single plant.

Kuhn (1961) reported the results of griev- ance case studies in eight large tire and elec- trical equipment plants. He found four socio-technical factors that apparently influ-

enced a work group’s desire to use the griev- ance procedure to bargain for special ben- efits: frequency of changes in work methods, standards, or materials; individualized work pace; frequency of interaction with others in the work group; and job specialization. Kuhn’s research underscored the political (bargain- ing) nature of the grievance procedure in which certain groups fight for special ben- efits for their own members, sometimes to the detriment of the rest of the bargaining unit employees and the union. More recent research by Lewin & Peterson (1988) found that where a particular issue is heavily grieved, labor and management are likely to negotiate language into the subsequent la- bor agreement to address the issue. This re- search supports Kuhn’s (1961) conclusion that grievance processing is a form of “frac- tional” or continuous bargaining that impacts formal contract negotiations.

Peach & Livernash (1974) compared pairs of high and low grievance departments in sev- eral steel plants in an attempt to highlight the variables contributing to differences in griev- ance activity. Their sample consisted of six plants ranging in size from 2,000 to more than 13,000 employees. The authors found that a high grievance rate was associated with an unfavorable task environment, aggressive and militant union leadership, and ineffective management decision-making as indicated by leadership, organizational, and policy deficien- cies. A low grievance rate was characterized by a favorable task environment, that is, one that is both relatively stable and largely free from technological disturbances, and with ef- fective management and organization policies. Following closely on the work of Peach & Livernash (1974), Muchinsky & Maassarani (1981) studied the impact of environmental factors on employee grievances in the public sector. They reported findings similar to those obtained by Peach and Livernash in steel manufacturing settings. In a larger study (1980), Muchinsky & Maassarini also found support for Ronan’s finding that the age of a manufacturing facility was negatively associ- ated with grievance activity.

While these studies appear to conclude that technology significantly influences employee grievance filing behavior, a more recent study
