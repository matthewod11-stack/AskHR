# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

ProQuest, PsycINFO, and ScienceDirect. We used ‘trust*” and “leader*” as the initial search

terms to identify manuscripts that included these terms in their title or abstract. This initial

search returned around 40,000 results (depending on the database used) and included peer-

reviewed manuscripts as well as unpublished work such as dissertations and conference

papers. The inclusion criteria required papers to: (i) report individual level, empirical,

quantitative data; and (ii) provide a zero-order correlation between any measure of leadership

styles and trust in the leader; or (iii) provide a zero-order correlation between trust in the

leader and any other-rated (or objective) measure of follower performance or OCB. In order

to calculate the sampling error, the study had to report sample size. In instances where the

appropriate statistics were not provided in the original manuscript, efforts were made to

contact corresponding authors and obtain the information necessary for inclusion. Overall, we

identified a total of 170 empirical articles that met our inclusion criteria. 15 of these articles

included multiple studies, yielding a total of 185 independent samples. Of these articles, 19

were unpublished (for full details of the papers included see Appendix B; all appendices

mentioned in this article can be found online as supplemental materials).

In order to obtain correlations between leadership styles and performance outcomes,

we first looked for previous meta-analyses that had included corrected correlations between

leadership styles and other-rated performance and OCB (e.g., Banks et al., 2016). As can be

seen in Appendix A, we relied on previous meta-analyses to provide most of the correlations

between leadership styles and employees’ performance and OCB (both other rated). For some

relationships, we additionally searched for papers that had correlations between leadership

styles (if not already available from other meta-analyses; see Appendix A). Details of the

studies included in our analysis can be found in Appendix B which includes a breakdown of

the articles used to produce meta-analytic correlations for each relationship. The coding of

the studies was completed by one of the authors. Once completed, another author (who did
