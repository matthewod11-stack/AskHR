# Relatively Unstructured Tests

Unlike formal tests of intelligence and self-report methods of assessing personality, which arose in response to public needs, relatively unstructured personality assessment meth- ods came about largely as the product of intellectual curios- ity. The best known and most widely used of these are the Rorschach Inkblot Method (RIM) and a variety of picture- story, Ô¨Ågure drawing, and sentence completion methods, the most prominent of these being the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), the Draw-a-Person (DAP), and the Rotter Incom- plete Sentences Blank (RISB).
