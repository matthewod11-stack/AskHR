- 2. Conceptual Clarifications

Motivation is generally concerned with why people choose a particular course of action in preference to others and why they continue with a chosen action after over a long period and in the face of difficulties, problems or challenges. The concept of motivation is multifaceted and has various characteristics. Mitacheel for example, identified four common characteristics which underlie definitions and explanations of individual motivation. This phenomenon, and prediction of behavior. Buchanan & Hueznski’s (2004) defined motivation as “the cognitive decision making process through which goal directed behavior is initiated, energized, directed and maintained”. Other researchers had earlier looked at motivation from the same perspective. For example, Steers & Peter (1983) and Baron internal that motivation (1991) stated processes that activate, guide and maintain behavior (especially goal directed behavior). Ryan & Deci (2000.54) explained that “to be motivated means to be moved to do something”. Recently, Butler & Rose (2011) described motivation as the course of movement, inspiration behind activity, and the feeling within individual that makes him want to achieve personal need or expectation.
