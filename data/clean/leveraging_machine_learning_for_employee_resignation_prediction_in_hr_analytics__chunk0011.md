## Wxi k Wxj(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:17) aT [Wxi k Wxk]

(cid:0)

(cid:1)(cid:1)

xi and xj thus represent the features of i and j, respectively. (cid:2399)e weight matrix W converts the feature vectors; the a(cid:2386)ention vector a computes the relevance of the network between the nodes. N(i) stands for the collection of neighbors of node i; operation k denotes vector concatenation. When aggregating the data for node i, the a(cid:2386)ention coe(cid:2649)cient ùõºij measures the degree of focus one should pay to node j‚Äô s features.

Aggregation of neighbor features weighted by the a(cid:2386)ention at layer l + 1. (cid:2399)is

coe(cid:2649)cients updates the node feature h(l+1)
