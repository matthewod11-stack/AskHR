# Limitations and future research

Despite its contribution, the present study has a number of limitations. Firstly, the depicted individual and employment factors explained only 12.3 % of the variance in employees’ perceptions of societal gender inequality and 12.5 % of the variance in their perceptions of workplace gender inequality. In addition, there might have been a two-way causality or correlation between the factors and the employees’ perceptions of gender inequality. For instance, it might have been that not requests for pay increase predicted employees’ perceptions of workplace gender inequality, but the opposite. Employees may perceive the existence of gender inequality in their workplaces and, thus, decide not to apply for a salary increase or they may ask for a pay rise because they feel that they have been discriminated against. Further theoretical and empirical investigations are thus needed to reveal the causality between variables factors and to broaden knowledge on how different patterns of the perceived gender inequality are interrelated.
