## Personal Developmental Plan at Brainstorm, Inc.—Part II

Cathy, one of the Partners of Brainstorm, Inc., has been look- ing into developmental plans as a possible way of increasing the productivity and morale of the company’s sales force. To help her in this project, Cathy has adapted a developmental plan form from a business magazine she has recently seen and asks you for feedback. Since Cathy is unfamiliar with the characteristics of good developmental plans, she is particu- larly interested in your critique of a developmental plan that she developed for a sales representative, Jay. Note: Brainstorm, Inc., may not be able to finance much in the way

of outside learning; however, the company could provide some paid time off and may be able to negotiate some better rates for attending classes or conferences, based on various industry memberships.

- 1. How would you improve and/or change the following form and its contents?

- 2. Since there are only six employees in the company, how would you adapt the form to meet the needs of this small business? Provide an example. (cid:2)
