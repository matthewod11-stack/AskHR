The flow diagram outlines the selection, eligibility, screening, and inclusion standards for reports that fall under the purview of a review (Selcxuk, 2019). Sierra-Correa and Cantera Kintz (2015) claim that PRISMA has three key benefits: the ability to define explicit research questions in order to do systematic highlights, the ability to use both inclusive and exclusive criteria, and the ability to quickly analyze a big database. PRISMA was used to identify earlier studies on the impact of workplace culture on deviant workplace behavior in this systematic review.

Regardless of the methodology chosen to do a litera- ture review, whether systematic literature review or other (narrative), there are two essential characteristics that must be present in a good literature review: selection of information sources and gathering of data with sufficient quantity, quality, and dependability (Mangas-Vega et al., 2018).

The fact that these databases provide coverage for a greater number of high-quality journals was a primary factor in our decision to use them.

Scientific databases, whether general or specialized, from the support of major corporations or
