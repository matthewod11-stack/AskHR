companies jump in. This necessitates a “lean startup” mindset and

fast product iterations where companies use data from real-world

experiments to get ahead of competitors. It is a colossally wasteful process, but also devastatingly eﬀective.

competition after it began selling vehicles in the China market in 2014.

In fact, Beijing encouraged Tesla’s arrival precisely to trigger such a

contest. As Tesla scaled up operations, local manufacturers like NIO,

Xpeng, and BYD began producing high-quality EVs at competitive

prices, challenging Tesla’s market position. Within six years, some 500

Chinese EV companies sprouted up, yet after ﬁerce competition only

100 remained in 2023. Of these, BYD surpassed Tesla as the world’s

largest EV manufacturer in total number of cars sold in 2023.

Initially, Tesla’s premium pricing strategy led to a loss of market share as price-sensitive consumers opted for more aﬀordable alternatives.
