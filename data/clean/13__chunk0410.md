Note that this is the error covariance structure assumed by HLM (i.e., the variance is computed from the sum squared residuals from Level-1 of the analysis). The problem with this pattern, and the advantage of LGCM, is that when modeling longitudinal data, the residuals may not be independent. A common approach to modeling longitudinal data is to assume that the residuals are correlated, such that eit=r(cid:1)ei(t(cid:2)1)+vi, where r is the autocorrelation coefﬁcient and viBN(0,s2). This is a ﬁrst-order auto- regressive model (AR[1]), yielding the following structure:
