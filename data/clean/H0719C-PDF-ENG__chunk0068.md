## People with mental health challenges, no matter the severity, can

thrive in the workplace and be valuable team members. Allies play

an important role by helping to provide the empathy and compassion

they need to overcome key challenges. Our collective will, empathy,

and compassion can break down the formidable barriers of stigma.

Workplace mental health initiatives can and do help. In the end, what

matters most is bringing our shared humanity into the workplace.
