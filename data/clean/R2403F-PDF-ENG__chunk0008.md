It’s understandable why breaking old habits is hard. Telling leaders

that the approach they’ve been following for 40 years—and the one

thing investors seem to understand about human capital (“cut it!”)—

is all wrong does not seem like a career-building move. Nonetheless,

HR executives can—and must—make the case to their CEOs and

operating executives that the old way is no longer working and that their

companies need to change direction.
