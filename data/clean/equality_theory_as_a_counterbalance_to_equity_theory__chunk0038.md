For instance, at a General Motors plant, the policy of reserved parking spaces was ended, but in practice choice spots con- tinued to be utilized only by top executives (Pascale 1990, p. 243). Or, consider Walmart’s policy of calling all employees associates. At the same time, Walmart has experienced numerous employee discrimination lawsuits that would suggest the shared title conveys little or no meaningful sense of existential equality. This is a critical issue. Overall, we have conceptualized and modeled the distributive equality of status leveling as an ideal type (Weber1947).Thatis,whatmightandcouldhappeninabest case scenario, not what always occurs in practice.

It is also important to realize how equality (and hence the results of any distributive equalization) is ultimately a dynamic process rather than static state. Here an interesting question might be: once status linked identities and prac- tices are deconstructed, what then? How does one work out Frazer’s sense of ‘‘recognition’’ in an ongoing way within
