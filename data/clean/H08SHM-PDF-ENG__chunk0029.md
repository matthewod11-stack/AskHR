## HBR / Digital Article / What Gets Measured, AI Will Automate

beside the sensors, trimming bandwidth and latency, while synthetic

data ﬁlls gaps when the real world is slow or awkward to capture.

Each extra decimal place quickly pays for itself: tiny error cuts

multiplied across millions of AI-driven decisions add up fast. As precise

measurement gets cheaper, ever-slimmer beneﬁt streams pencil out,

and tasks once too minor to monitor slide into the automation net.

Not only may we soon have intelligence too cheap to meter, we’ll also

be measuring ever more of the world to expand—and continuously

upgrade—what that intelligence can reach. We already live in the era

of “artiﬁcial-metrics intelligence,” where anything we can quantify is

swiftly queued for automation.
