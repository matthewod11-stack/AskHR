## suggests that employees may value narrative-only feedback more when

there is ambiguity about their performance levels, as it provides a

richer, more nuanced evaluation that can soften the blow of negative

assessments. When feedback is overwhelmingly positive, such as when

an employee achieves the highest performance ratings, the format

is less inﬂuential. Employees respond well to very positive feedback

regardless of whether the feedback is numerical, narrative, or a

combination of the two, since the positive outcome is clear and there

is little room for interpretation.

In another experiment, we investigated how knowledge of monetary

outcomes, like bonus amounts, inﬂuences reactions to feedback

formats. Initially, employees who received narrative feedback perceived

their evaluations as fairer and more positive than those who received

numerical or combined feedback. Yet, once employees were informed of

their speciﬁc bonus amounts, perceptions of fairness became similar

across all feedback formats. Being informed of tangible outcomes

clariﬁed the implications of the feedback, leading to more uniform

perceptions of fairness across all formats. In other words, while

narrative feedback can initially be perceived as more favorable, such

perceptions may diminish once concrete outcomes are revealed,

leveling the playing ﬁeld between diﬀerent feedback types.
