If you sense hesitation from your boss upon asking to exercise thebenefits granted to you, don’t be afraid to make your case. You cansay, “Taking this time off is important to me since I haven’t seenmy family for over two years now. Is there anything I can do tomake you feel more comfortable with it? What concerns do youhave that I could help address for you and the team? I would reallyappreciate your support.”We’ve all seen the loss and grief that most of us have enduredduring the pandemic — with companies being pushed to includemore inclusive leave policies such as bereavement leaves,extended sick days, caregiving and wellness days, and childcareleaves. Should an emergency arrive, remind yourself that taking aholiday to look after yourself or your loved ones doesn’t make youdisengaged or unmotivated at work.Rather, asking for the time you deserve is a sign that yourecognize and appreciate the things (and people) that areimportant to help you work better: your health, your family, andmost importantly, yourself.
