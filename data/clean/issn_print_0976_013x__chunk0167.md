As latent variables are not subject to direct observation, they cannot be measured directly. This

study considers Risk-taking as an exogenous variable. In contrast, the observed variables are

Proactiveness and Innovativenessâ€”the above components are indicators of the fundamental

constructs they embody. The additional mediating variables comprise Circular Practices' target

Performance as indicators. Upon implementation of PLS-SEM, an evaluation is conducted to

determine how each indicator variable contributes to representing its corresponding construct.

Additionally, an assessment is made to determine the effectiveness of the collective set of

indicator variables in representing the construct, focusing on reliability and validity. The present

evaluation pertains to assessing the measurement model utilising the partial least squares-

structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation
