## e.g., for escalation, go/no-go decisions, risk mitigation, and so on.

Determining whether the same thresholds apply across all markets or

whether they will vary by market is a foundational decision and impacts

how your RAI program rolls out for years to come.

- 2. Are your RAI values clearly connected to procedures?

Many organizations have an RAI values statement. Almost every one

of these includes a commitment to high-level concepts like fairness,

privacy, transparency, safety, and accountability. The problem is that,

articulated this abstractly, the values are impossible to implement.

The solution is to connect those values to procedures. For instance,

to be committed to fairness may refer, in part, to a commitment to

identifying which stakeholders might be discriminated against at each

stage of the AI lifecycle. It may also include a commitment to managing

those potentially discriminatory outcomes and conferring with those

stakeholders when the risk is suﬃciently high.

Without this connection to more concrete procedures, it’s just not clear

what the values amount to in practice because words like “safety” and “fairness” likely mean diﬀerent things to diﬀerent stakeholders

throughout the organization. Agreement on high-level values that mean diﬀerent things to diﬀerent people creates the illusion of

internal alignment. That illusion evaporates when organizations try to implement programs across misaligned staﬀ.

- 3. Have you designed RAI metrics (KPIs and OKRs)?

If there is one place where organizations stumble, it is in designing

metrics to measure the rollout, compliance, and impact of the RAI

program. But this is essential when we’re talking about implementing
