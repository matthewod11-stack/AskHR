## HBR / Digital Article / The Insidious Effects of Hurrying

Hurry sickness can also leave you physically and mentally exhausted

as you rush from task to task and don’t allow time for basic self-care

such as regular, healthy meals, adequate sleep, and taking breaks.

Increasingly fatigued, your immune system can become suppressed,

leading to greater susceptibility to infectious illness.

At work, hurry sickness can lead to poor decision-making as well

as suboptimal outcomes when you don’t take time to think things

through, or when rushing results in careless errors. Deep in the throes

of hurry sickness, you experience a decreased ability to absorb, process,

and use new information, and your ability to innovate can suﬀer as

well, as creativity usually can’t be hurried. Relationships can suﬀer

because you’re easily irritated when others don’t keep up with your

intense pace, or because you’re openly skeptical of their ability to get things done eﬃciently. When relationships falter, team dynamics suﬀer

— as does team output, as eﬀective collaboration is compromised.

When chronic workplace stress leads to exhaustion, negativity, and

underperformance, the ﬁnal outcome of hurry sickness can be full-

blown burnout.
