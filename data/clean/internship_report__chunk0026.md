The topic mainly covers the HR Planning & Policy Development of Karnaphuli Group.

Karnaphuli is one of the renowned Groups of Bangladesh. It established in 1954 and named

after a river on whose banks the port city of Chittagong stands, Karnaphuli has with the ebb and

flow of the past 58 years evolved and grown into a business house of diversified subsidiaries and

activities. Its growth has been characterized by a single minded and dedicated pursuit of

excellence and a professional urge to be the market leader in everything it is involved and

engaged in. Not surprisingly perhaps, Karnaphuli holds the unique distinction of being the first

company in Bangladesh to achieve ISO 9002 Certification.
