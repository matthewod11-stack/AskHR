# encourages collaboration.

Fidelity Investments, the ﬁnancial services ﬁrm, recently restructured

its personal investing group in a team format. Each team has a clear

mission and much autonomy in how to accomplish it. The roughly

5,000-person organization now has just three layers below the president

and operates at lower cost and with shorter cycle times for innovation.

done through software that generates detailed metrics. Reports are

produced 24/7 and highlight any red ﬂags in the data.
