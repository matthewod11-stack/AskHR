perceptions of both (a) societal and (b) workplace gender inequality, are presented. The model was tested drawing on the data of the Finnish Gender Equality Barometer 2008.

Several findings of the study are worth mentioning. Firstly, male and female employees differ in their perceptions of both societal and workplace gender inequality in a way that female employees perceive both types of gender inequality to a greater extent than their male counterparts. This is somewhat obvious and is in line with the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999), which claims that women in general hold different values than men so that men and women differ in their perceptions.

Secondly, the finding that older employees perceive both types of gender inequality to a greater extent than their younger colleagues is in line with the anticipatory injustice model (Shapiro and Kirkman, 2001). According to the model, people’s perceptions match their schemata, which are based on their prior experience. The older an employee is, the more experience he/she obtains, the more is the likelihood that he/she has experienced injustice and thus continually sees it.

Thirdly, the finding that employees with full-time contracts perceive workplace gender inequality to a greater extent than employees with part-time contracts might be explained with occupational socialization theory (Smith and Rogers, 2000), according to which employees are socialized within work environment through training, organizational culture, and workplace rewards. Employees with full-time contracts socialize more within their work environments and, thus, hear more about possible cases that related to gender inequality than employees with part-time contracts. Furthermore, although there is empirical evidence that fixed-term and part-time employees encounter more discrimination than employees with permanent and full-time contracts (e.g., Husu, 2005), the present study suggests that employees with full-time contracts are likely to have more experience, hear more often about the cases of gender discrimination and, thus, are more conscious of workplace gender inequality than employees who have part-time employment contracts.

Next, it is noteworthy that employees whose employers’ attitude towards taking family leave for male employees is more positive, perceived both societal and workplace gender inequality to a lesser extent than employees whose employers’ attitude towards taking family leave for male employees is less positive. It goes along with role-balance theory (Marks and MacDermid, 1996). According to the theory, when people achieve a balance between their various roles, so that both mothers and fathers are encouraged to take a family leave, perceptions of gender inequality decrease.

Furthermore, although requests for pay increase were not hypothesized to have an impact on employees’ perceptions of workplace gender inequality (included as a control variable), they were significantly associated with employees’ perceptions of workplace gender inequality. The results showed that employees, who requested a pay increase, perceived workplace gender inequality to a greater extent than those employees who did not request any pay increases. It might be so that employees, who did not request pay increases, had fewer chances to be rejected and relate this rejection to possible social inequalities, including gender inequality. In contrast, employees, who felt justified in asking for pay increase, had more chances to be rejected and relate the rejection to social inequalities, including gender
