For example, Lazarus et al. (1980) argue that an observer’s emotional reactions to a target are a function of primary and secondary appraisals. More speciﬁcally, primary appraisal concerns the question of ‘‘What are the implications of the stimulus (e.g., stigma) for my well-being?’’ For instance, a person may react more negatively to a person with leprosy than one who has rheumatoid arthritis because leprosy is contagious, whereas arthritis is not. Secondary appraisal has to do with the question of ‘‘Can I cope with the stimulus, and thus prevent harm to myself’’? For instance, whereas an observer might cope with a person with AIDS by avoiding all interactions with him or her, coping with a target who suffers from disﬁguring arthritis might involve avoiding eye contact with the person (Colella & Stone, 2005).
