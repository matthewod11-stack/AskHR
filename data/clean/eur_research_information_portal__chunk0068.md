In this article, we have articulated a multi-level model of inclusive leadership in an organizational context. Our theoretical model, which is summarized in Figure 1, is intended to help guide future research as well as practice. We advocated for the intimate interconnection between inclusive leadership and the type of diversity that leaders face. As we have described, inclusive leadership is a process that unfolds at multiple levels of analysis (individual, workgroup, and organizational) and entails a complex set of proactive (Ô¨Årst- stage moderation) and reactive (second-stage moderation) leadership func- tions. Its complexity begs the question of whether and how inclusive lead- ership can be developed in organizations.
