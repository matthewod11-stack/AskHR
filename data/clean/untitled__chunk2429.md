# Early Developments

the long-awaited placid life. Events such as the McCarthy hearings, the Korean War, and the duplicity in the U.S. State Department undermining democracy in Guatemala con- tributed to the feeling that, in fact, the country was facing se- rious problems (Halberstam, 1993; Herman, 1999; Rovere, 1996; Schrecker, 1998; Zinn, 1999). Additionally, popular novels like The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit (Wilson, 1955) and Peyton Place (Metalious, 1956), as well as the inves- tigative research of Betty Friedan (1963) on the social and economic restraints of women, questioned the sense of jus- tice in the lives of U.S. citizens. Further, the groundbreaking inquiries into American sexual behavior by Alfred Kinsey (1948, 1953) augmented Friedan’s reporting to raise aware- ness about gender and sexual inequalities. Alternatively, advances in reproductive biology by Gregory Pincus and Hudson Hoagland created the birth control pill Enovid (Asbell, 1995; Watkins, 1998). Clare Boothe Luce cap- tured the signiﬁcance of the Pill when she said, “Modern woman is at last free as a man is free, to dispose of her own body, to earn her living, to pursue the improvement of her mind, to try a successful career” (Halberstam, 1993, pp. 605–606). Each of these signiﬁcant cultural events stimu- lated increased awareness about societal problems as well as providednew opportunities to pursue individual freedoms.

In sum, Americans’beliefs, values, and goals in the 1950s were being confronted; the alleged happiness with existing gender roles and race relations were being questioned. Americans were being forced to see the extent of violence and racism that was prevalent. Members of the mental health professions were also taking notice of these negative features of American society. The eyes of these professionals were being forced open. These events signiﬁed serious issues in the country that needed addressing; it seems plausible that a zeitgeist was emerging that called for a closer inspection and appraisal of America’s communities.
