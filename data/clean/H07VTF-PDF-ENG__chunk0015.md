# HBR / Digital Article / How to Protect Your Boundaries When Your Company Is Strugg…

need to be coordinated for a consulting project. In these cases, you’ll

need to evaluate the situation on its merits.

Limiting your availability can be especially diﬃcult to do when your

company is struggling — you don’t want to be seen as not pulling your

weight. This is why communication is key. If you plan on setting your

phone on “do not disturb” or are limiting your timeframe of answering

emails after a particular time, clearly relay that to the rest of your team

to manage their expectations of you.

According to Jim Harter, chief scientist for Gallup’s workplace

management practice, speaking up is the best step to setting workplace

boundaries. Let your manager know what is and isn’t working and the

goals you’re trying to achieve. If you have yet to set boundaries and

communicate what you need within your current role, then you’ll just

take that lack of clarity into a diﬀerent setting if you shift to another job,

eliminating the original stressor but not the origin of your stress.

Working longer hours for a struggling company may make you feel like a

hero, but one person’s eﬀorts will not save an at-risk organization. Focus

your energy where you have the most signiﬁcant impact and consider

what makes sense for you in the long run.
