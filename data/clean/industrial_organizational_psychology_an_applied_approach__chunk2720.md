All of the readability indices show reasonable reliability and correlate highly with one another (Blumenfeld & Justice, ). (The readability levels of selected publications are shown in Table ..) As we can see from these indices, an easily read document has short sentences, uses simple rather than complicated words, and uses common rather than unusual words.

Specialized indices have also been introduced by both Flesch (), who measured the human interest level of reading material, and Tysinger and Pitchford (), who developed a method for determining the readability of trait-based psychological tests. Many word processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word) now contain readability indices that make it easier to determine the audience level for which the document was written. To practice how to measure the readability of a document, complete Exercise . in your workbook.
