# Applied Case Study

As mentioned in your

chapter, ordering errors are common at the drive-thru windows of quick-service restaurants such as Hardee’s, McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s. One of the reasons for these errors is that order takers are distracted and thus don’t listen properly. That is, while taking one customer’s

order, an employee is simultaneously taking money and counting change for another customer, filling drinks, and assembling food orders. Another reason is that some customers may not speak the same language as the person taking the order.
