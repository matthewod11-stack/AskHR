# Figure 4.14 Psychological résumé

information to put into these two sections, three impression-management rules should be used: relevance, unusualness, and positivity. If information is relevant to your desired career, it probably should be included. For example, you might mention that you have two children if you are applying for a position in day care or elementary school teaching, but not if you are applying for a job involving a lot of travel. How far back should one go in listing jobs? Using the principle of relevance, the answer would be far enough back to include all relevant jobs. It is certainly acceptable to list hobbies if they are relevant.

Unusual information should be included when possible, as people pay more attention to it than to typical information. A problem for college seniors is that their résumés look identical to those of their classmates. That is, most business majors take the same classes, belong to the same clubs, and have had similar part-time jobs. To stand out from other graduates, an applicant needs something unusual, such as an internship, an interesting hobby, or an unusual life experience (e.g., spent a year in Europe, rode a bike across the country).

Though it is advisable to have unusual information, the information must also be positive. It probably would not be a good idea to list unusual information such as “I’ve been arrested more times than anyone in my class” or “I enjoy bungee jumping without cords.” The unacceptability of these two examples is obvious, and few applicants would make the mistake of actually placing such informa- tion on their résumés; however, more subtle items can have the same effect. For example, suppose you enjoy hunting and are a member of the Young Democrats on campus. Including these items might make a negative impression on Republi- cans and those who oppose hunting. Include only information that most people will find positive (such as Red Cross volunteer, worked to help finance education, and so on), and avoid information that may be viewed negatively, such as political affiliation, religion, and dangerous hobbies (Bonner, ).

Of the many positive activities and accomplishments that you could list, list only your best. Do not list everything you have done; research by Spock and Stevens () found that it is better to list a few great things, rather than a few great things and many good things. This finding is based on Anderson’s () averaging versus adding model of impression formation, which implies that activity quality is more important than quantity. It is neither necessary nor desirable to list all of your coursework. To practice writing a psychological résumé, complete the Résumé Writing Exercise (.) in your workbook.
