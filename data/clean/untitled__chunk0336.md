# 30 Psychology as a Profession

such as Atlantic Monthly, Business World, Advertising World, and The Woman’s Herald, thus making business psychology known to a broad audience of potential employers and con- sumers. Scott promoted the psychology of suggestion, argu- ing that successful advertising suggested a course of action, that is, buying the product. He wrote, “Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible” (Scott, 1903, p. 59). In applying suggestion to advertising, Scott advocated two tech- niques: the direct command (e.g., “Use Peterson’s Tooth Powder”) and the return coupon. Both techniques were thought to stimulate compulsive obedience.

In the subsequent theoretical debates in the advertising community on the nature of consumer behavior, other approaches displaced Scott’s views (see Kuna, 1976, 1979), but his work gave psychology considerable visibility in the world of business and paved the way for many psychologists who would follow in advertising such as Harry Hollingworth, Daniel Starch, and John B. Watson.

Although business psychology can be said to have begun in the ﬁeld of advertising, it quickly branched into other prominent areas. When increased emphasis on efﬁciency led to the “scientiﬁc management” of Frederick Winslow Taylor (1911), psychologists entered that arena as well. Efﬁciency meant not only better management and more effective adver- tising but also better training of workers, improved employee selection procedures, better ways to control employee per- formance, and better understanding of human actions in work. Prominent in these areas was Harvard psychologist Hugo Münsterberg (1863–1916), who argued in his book, Psychology and Industrial Efﬁciency (1913), that the key to workplace efﬁciency was matching job and worker and that successful matches generated satisﬁed employees, quality work, and high productivity. Münsterberg promoted psy- chology as the science of human efﬁciency, noting that psychology had the tools to create the perfect match by de- termining the mental traits required for any job and the men- tal traits of workers. That his ideas were well received by a broad public is evidenced by the fact that his book was for a time on the national list of best-sellers.

Psychologists began to develop mental tests to evaluate workers and jobs (ship captains, trolley car operators, sales- women), work that was to prove especially important when they were asked to oversee the selection program for the United States armed forces during World War I. Business psychology had begun in the universities, but its practice soon moved to business settings as psychologists found full- time employment, particularly as personnel ofﬁcers involved with selection, job analysis, and training. Such opportunities

expanded considerably after World War I, establishing the psychologist as a key player in the world of business.
