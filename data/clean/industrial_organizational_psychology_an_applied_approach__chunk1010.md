# Dear Mr. Smith:

Enclosed is a copy of my résumé. Please consider me for the position of welder that was advertised in the Roanoke Times and World News.

For several reasons, I believe that I am qualiﬁed for your position. First, I have six years of welding experience in an industrial setting. Second, I am a very dependable worker as shown by the fact that I have missed only two days of work in the last ﬁve years. Finally, I am available to work any shift at any of your three plants.

I look forward to hearing from you. I can best be reached after 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and anytime on weekends.

Sincerely,
