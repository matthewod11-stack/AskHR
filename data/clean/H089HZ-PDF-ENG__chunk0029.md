Equally important, you need to accept that you won’t get it right the

ﬁrst time, and that’s ok. An iterative learning process takes time, and

missteps along the way are a critical part of learning. Don’t assume

that the ﬁrst policy you create is the right one, or even that what

is right today will remain right in the future — in fact, go into the

process expecting any plan to need adjusting. A critical part of your

process is recognizing — and communicating — up front that periodic

reassessment of any policy will be needed.
