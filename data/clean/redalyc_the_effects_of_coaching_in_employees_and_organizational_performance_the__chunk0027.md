Additionally, Hannafey and Vitulano (2013) explain that coaching is a partnership between a

management-level client and a coach hired by an organisation to assist the employee in

becoming a more effective and successful manager. It was also highlighted its usefulness in the

socialization of employees by Saks and Gruman (2011). Thus, we can state that coaching is a

process designed by an organisation that involves two parties—a coach and a coachee—and

that aims to correct performance work-related problems and to improve the coachee’s skills

and capabilities to assist in career development. We use this definition in the current work.
