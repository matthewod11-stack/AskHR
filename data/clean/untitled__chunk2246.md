of the community or to safeguard group deliberation pro- cesses. The Court apparently misread the data and declared that the difference in effects between 6- and 12-member juries to be only “negligible.” The “naivete and ignorance of the Court” (Bersoff, 1986, p. 155) stimulated social scientists to conduct more research on the effects of jury size, espe- cially differences between 6- and 12-person juries.

In a subsequent case, Ballew v. Georgia (1978), more sci- entiﬁc data (based on 18 studies) were submitted bearing on the differences between 6- and 12-member juries. The Court referred to these studies in its decision but ignored any dif- ference between 6- and 12-person juries, focusing its atten- tion on 5-member juries (which had not been studied in the research) and ﬁnding them unconstitutional. Although these jury-size cases are sometimes cited by psychologists as illus- trating that the Supreme Court may pay close attention to em- pirical research, it is instructive that in a portion of the Ballew opinion, three justices expressed their “reservations as to the wisdom—as well as the necessity—of Mr. Justice Blackmun’s heavy reliance on numerology [emphasis ours] derived from statistical studies” (p. 246). As Loh (1981, p. 340) summed it up, “The data were apparently used to ornament a decision reached on other legal and policy grounds. . . . The opinion used social science the way a drunk uses a lamp post, for support rather than illumination.”

Perhaps researchers need to realize that attorneys and judges, who are not strongly socialized in the value of empir- ical research as psychological researchers are, will take a dif- ferent perspective on the utility of empirical evidence. Bersoff (1986, pp. 155–156) stated it well: “It is relatively clear, then, that the relationship between experimental psy- chologists and the courts is less than perfect. In fact, if that re- lationship were to be examined by a Freudian, the analyst would no doubt conclude that it is a highly neurotic, conﬂict- ridden ambivalent affair (I stress affair because it is certainly no marriage). Like an insensitive scoundrel involved with an attractive but fundamentally irksome lover who too much wants to be courted, the judiciary shamelessly uses the social sciences. Courts cite the result of psychological research when they believe it will enhance the elegance of their opin- ions but empiricism is readily discarded when more tradi- tional and legally acceptable bases for decision making are available.”
