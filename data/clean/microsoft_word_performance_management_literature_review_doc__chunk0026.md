The first is for objective setting, the second for development planning, the third for ongoing coaching and the fourth to review performance and pay.

Sillup et al. (2010) discuss that traditionally appraisals are completed once a year and usually include a mid-year discussion, but they argue research has indicated that this is too infrequent because raters face problems with remembering what employees did over the previous months (Campbell et al., 1970, cited in Sillup et al., 2010). Juran (2004, cited in Sillup et al., 2010) found that organisations with monthly or quarterly performance appraisals ‘outperformed competitors on every financial and productivity measure and got positive feedback from employees about the fairness of the PA system’ (p.42).

At Standard Chartered Bank the appraisal process is called ‘Conversations that Count’. The aims are to increase staff engagement, develop staff and deliver better results. Managers have four conversations with their staff during the year: perform (the appraisal against personal objectives; learn and develop (planning learning required to perform their job); careers (building the potential to take on larger roles); and engagement (where managers ask staff how well the organisation knows them, cares about them, helps them to focus and develops their strengths).

A later study by the Institute for Employment Studies (Hirsh et al., 2004) interviewed employees who said they had experienced a manager who had ‘developed’ them. Again conversations lay at the heart of this process, as did managers being close to employees and their work and giving them focused coaching and access to work experiences. This kind of attention improved performance via its impact on confidence and motivation. These psychological effects were as important as skill acquisition in the impact of developmental management styles. Effective developers also created a climate of openness within their teams and encouraged informal discussions about work issues.

A survey by the Career Innovation Group (Winter and Jackson, 2004) asked over 700 high performers in a small sample of large, mostly global, organisations to comment on the conversations they had at work which had high impact on them. Not surprisingly, these high performing employees are the kinds of people who receive a lot of attention, and they had regular conversations about their work, especially with their managers. However, they were not always getting the types of conversations they most needed.

(cid:1) About half of the conversations having the greatest impact were performance

related, and about half of these took place in appraisals.

(cid:1) By contrast, only about a quarter of high impact conversations were

development related, and less than a quarter of these took place in appraisals.
