multiple levels described on each competency from the highest to the lowest degree of application, now it is relatively common to simply have lists of indicators and contra-indicators for each competency, and to leave managers and employees more flexibility and discretion in applying these to specific jobs.

The guidance needed to advise on the application of larger frameworks also becomes very lengthy and ‘off-putting to users’. Whiddett and Hollyforde (ibid) state that the ‘thickness of a document is usually inversely related to the number of people who read it’. They provide the example of a government agency that had a framework with over 60 competencies, each with five levels of complexity. Users found it impossible to apply, and the 200 page reference document ‘undermined any confidence they might have that they could make the framework work’. The agency addressed this problem by identifying the behaviours common to all roles in the organisation and produced a second framework with 12 competencies, accompanied by a 12 page guidance document. This was found to meet users’ needs adequately (Whiddett and Hollyforde, 1999).

Splitting competency frameworks into a core set of common, often behavioural competencies such as communications and management skills, alongside of an additional set of technical or professional competencies, which are generally now tailored by the occupational group, rather than attempted to fit within a common corporate framework, is also now very common in large organisations. It seems to be a means of getting some consistency in definitions without restricting occupations to specify some of their specific requirements.

Ensuring the success of competency frameworks requires them to: be sufficiently flexible to adapt to organisational change; have support from the top of the organisation and from the stakeholders who will influence it the most; have a high profile champion who promotes the use of the framework; keep it simple, rather than overly comprehensive; descriptors that are understood by employees; the use of relevant behaviours; the setting of clear boundaries between the different competency levels and a framework that has a clear purpose that is understood and welcomed by employees and managers (IDS, 2008 ).

Following the simplification theme, simpler process and paperwork may be supported by more regular meetings, although each meeting is often more focused and shorter than using the one meeting per annum model. At a major charity there are now a minimum of four meetings a year, with each having a distinct focus.
