# Ethics of Motivation Strategies

In 2001, a Hooter’s chain in Panama City Beach, Florida,

came up with the idea of having a beer selling contest to motivate its servers to sell as much beer as possible in the month of April. The top-selling waitress from each Hooter’s in the area had her name entered into a drawing. The waitress whose name was drawn would win the prize. Based on what the managers at each Hooter’s told their staff, the competing waitresses thought they would be winning a new Toyota automobile. The competition was a success: Most of the Hooter’s in the area seemed to have increased their sales of beer.

Jodee Berry was the winning waitress. On the day

she was told she was the winner, she was blindfolded and led to the restaurant parking lot. However, instead of receiving a new Toyota car, she was presented with a Star Wars toy Yoda doll. Inside the restaurant, the manager and other staff were laughing.

Ms. Berry didn’t think it was so funny. She worked hard to win this contest. Her motivation level was high because of the thought of winning a Toyota, not a toy Yoda. So, she sued Gulf Coast Wings, Inc., owners of the restaurant, alleging breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation. She was seeking as compensation the cost of a new Toyota car. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

As you read in this chapter, organizations come

up with creative ways to try to motivate employ- ees to work harder, work safer, or to cut costs. But the question is: Should there be any limits on the type of motivator that is used? Is it okay to use any motivational strategy just as long as it has the desired results?

Another example of creative motivation is the one employed by a manager of one corporation who

bought ten golden bonsai trees and held a Save a Tree competition. Each month, the ten lowest users of pa- per would receive one of the bonsai trees, which could be displayed for the coming month. It did the trick! Employees were motivated to save paper. Apparently, the bonsai tree had a certain appeal to these employ- ees. Everyone wanted one!

In another company, the motivator for working

shortcuts, and can often lead to bullying and the use of fear tactics by some employees against others as a form of intimidating them into losing the competi- tion. They also say that it rewards people for using bad behavior in order to achieve a goal set by the company. It doesn’t motivate them to do better at their job. And finally, it treats people differently and unfairly.

harder was a nice steak dinner at a nice restaurant; the losers of the competition also got to go to the restaurant, but they had to sit at a lousy table and eat beans. After dinner, the winners got to rip the shirts off the back of the losers! This type of motivator, like the Hooter’s and Save a Tree competitions, was also successful. It did what it set out to do: increase sales for the department.

A professor at a small college motivates his students by promising $100 to the student who makes the highest test grade. If more than one student has the same grade, they split the $100 between them. There are three tests per semester. So, theoretically, a student could end the semester $300 richer! Another professor at a different college offers gift cards to various stores and restaurants to the top classroom performers. The thinking behind these motivators is that it will encourage students to study harder.
