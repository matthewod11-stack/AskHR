psychosis. For some years he conducted research on the effects of various febrile illnesses (e.g., tuberculosis) on patients with diagnosis of psychosis, reporting some suc- cesses and many failures. In 1917 he treated some general paresis patients with blood from a patient infected with malaria. Three of them died, and not until 1919 was he able to deﬁne the kind of malarial infection that would be beneﬁ- cial. Others quickly accepted his technique, and in 1924 he received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.

The exact manner in which these effects occurred was a matter of speculation, many physicians concluding that the high heat of the fever itself killed the organisms causing the syphilitic infection. Other methods of generating high heat were employed, including hot baths, hot air, radiothermy, electric blankets, and so forth. The general success of the fever treatment prompted an attempt to apply it to cases of schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychosis, and other psy- chiatric syndromes. These were unsuccessful, and the use of malarial fever treatment in GPI was abandoned with the dis- covery of penicillin (Shorter, 1997).
