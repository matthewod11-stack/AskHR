We assessed scales’ reliability using three different indicators: Cronbach’s alpha, corrected item-total correlations and composite reliability. Cronbach’s alpha for coaching was .929 and for performance .884 (Table 3), well above the accepted threshold of 0.7 that suggests acceptable reliability (Nunnally, 1978). Concerning corrected item-total correlation, scales presented values ranging from .556 to .826 (Table 2), all of them also above the accepted threshold that suggests acceptable reliability. Finally, composite reliability indexes ranged from .880 for performance to .930 for coaching (Table 3), also exceeding the threshold of 0.6, necessary for measurement reliability (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988; Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Globally, these results suggest that the scales present good reliability.

The average variance extracted (AVE) rendered values of .626 for coaching and .515 for performance (Table 3), also suggesting adequate convergent validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).

Discriminant validity of the measures was assessed by comparing the square root of the AVE values to the factor correlations; the results indicate that the square root of AVE for each factor is bigger than its correlations (Table 3), suggesting adequate discriminant validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).
