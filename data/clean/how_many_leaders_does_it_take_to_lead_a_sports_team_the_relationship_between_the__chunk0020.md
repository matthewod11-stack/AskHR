# Participants

The participants were 531 professional soccer players in the Spanish Soccer League. The sam- ple included 317 male players (18 teams playing in the third highest division) and 214 female players (13 teams playing in the highest division). The male players were between 17 and 37 years old (M = 25.25; SD = 4.70) with an average soccer experience of 15.98 years (SD = 5.53), whereas the female players were between 16 and 36 years old (M = 22.22, SD = 4.41) with an average soccer experience of 12.27 years (SD = 3.96). From the original sample of 559 ques- tionnaires collected at the end of the season, 28 questionnaires (i.e., 5.01%) were excluded due to invalid completion (i.e., more than 50% of the questions were not completed, more than one answer was given to the same question, or the presence of a clear response pattern).
