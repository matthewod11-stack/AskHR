realized that I started building my chosen family when I was 14 and 15

years old in high school. I didn’t know what it was called. I didn’t know

I was building an ally network. There was no book to read, there was no

guidebook to follow. But I realized that I was ﬁnding my conﬁdants and

my conﬁdence through my conﬁdants, and I was charting these lifelong

relationships, that I’m still friends with people that I went to middle

school with, that I went to high school with, and particularly my college

friends. That became a lifelong relationship and the support network

that I needed.
