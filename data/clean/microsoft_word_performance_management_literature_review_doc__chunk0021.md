(cid:1) Appraisal is ‘done to’ employees and therefore does not have the desired impact on them. It has little perceived value or relevance for employees. Roberts (2002) sets out criteria for performance appraisal to be participative from the employee’s point of view. Cawley et al. (1998) showed in a meta- analysis of 27 studies that participation by the appraisee in performance appraisal is associated with higher levels of acceptance of the appraisal and satisfaction with the process.

(cid:1) Line managers are not committed, partly because of this bureaucracy, but also

because the system is not ‘sold’ well enough, or supported by wider management culture. They ‘go through the motions’.

(cid:1) Managers do not have the skills to operate appraisal effectively, either in

judging performance or handling difficult conversations, especially with poor performers.

(cid:1) Employees’ relative performance can never be measured objectively or fairly. Even if the manager’s judgement is careful and evidence-based, objectives are not equally hard to achieve and do not cover all aspects of the job. Putting more effort into ‘accurate’ performance measurement is a delusion.

(cid:1) The manager’s perception of an employee’s performance may not be very valid, simply because they do not have enough information and do not see all aspects of their performance. They may also be biased by liking or disliking the individual or by prejudice.

(cid:1) Managers may not always be the best person to support an employee in

exploring their own performance and development (Mayo, 1997). Performance appraisals have become increasingly difficult to administer because of management delayering. If a manager has multiple subordinates, it becomes impossible for them to intimately know the performance and development needs of all their direct reports (Ledford et al., 1994).
