## Stress increases rating errors (Srinivas & Motowidlo, 1987).

Raters rate employees of same race higher than employees of a different race (Kraiger & Ford, 1985; Pulakos, White, Oppler, & Borman, 1989).

raters who were not under stress. This finding is important because performance evaluations are often conducted hurriedly, as supervisors evaluate employee performance so they can return to their “real” work. Methods for reducing this problem will be discussed later in this chapter.

raters who neither like nor dislike their employees (Cardy & Dobbins, ). But this does not mean that a person who is liked will always receive higher ratings than someone who is disliked. The rater may overcompensate in an effort to be “fair.” The rater’s feelings, or affect, toward an employee may interfere with the cognitive processing of actual performance information.

Research on the presence of racial bias in performance evaluations is both controversial and mixed. Two reviews of the literature (Landy, Shankster, & Kohler, ; Latham & Wexley, ) concluded that racial biases do not play a significant role in performance appraisals. A meta-analysis of  studies by Kraiger and Ford () found a racial similarity bias in that White raters gave higher performance ratings to White employees, and African American raters gave higher ratings to African American employees. Interestingly, this bias occurred only with studies involving real organizations—laboratory research seldom revealed racial bias in performance ratings. Complicating this issue is a study by Stauffer and Buckley () arguing that much of the research in this area is flawed and that when the proper method (repeated measures) is used, evidence of racial bias in performance ratings exists.

A meta-analysis by Bowen, Swim, and Jacobs () and a large data set of -degree feedback ratings by Church, Rogelberg, and Waclawski () suggest that gender bias does not seem to be an issue in performance ratings. Meta-analysis results also indicate that age is not related to performance ratings (Ng & Feldman, ).
