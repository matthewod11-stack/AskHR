## Document the various prompt a(cid:350)empts

The last tip was mentioned before in this chapter, but we can’t stress enough how impo(cid:457)ant

it is: document your prompt a(cid:459)empts in full detail so you can learn over time what went well

and what did not.

Prompt outputs can di(cid:441)er across models, across sampling se(cid:459)ings, and even across di(cid:441)erent

versions of the same model. Moreover, even across identical prompts to the same model,

small di(cid:441)erences in output sentence forma(cid:459)ing and word choice can occur. (For example, as mentioned previously, if two tokens have the same predicted probability, ties may be broken

randomly. This can then impact subsequent predicted tokens.).
