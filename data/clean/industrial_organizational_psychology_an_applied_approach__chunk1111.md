# Ethical Issues

Because providing references and letters of recommendation is a rather subjec- tive process, several ethical problems can arise involving their use. Raynes () lists three ethical guidelines that reference providers should follow.

First, explicitly state your relationship with the person you are recommend- ing. That is, are you the applicant’s professor, boss, coworker, friend, relative, or some combination of the five? This is important because people often have dual roles: A person may be a supervisor as well as a good friend. Without under- standing the exact nature of the referee–referent relationship, making judgments about the content of a reference can be difficult. For example, I was told of a situ- ation in which an applicant received a glowing letter of recommendation from a coworker and in which the applicant was hired in part due to the strength of that letter. Within a few months, the new employee was engaged in discipline prob- lems, and it was only then that the organization discovered that the person who had written the glowing letter was the applicant’s daughter. Because the mother’s and daughter’s last names were different and because the exact relationship between the two was not stated in the letter, the organization never suspected that they were related.
