## Prevention as a Deﬁning Focus for Community Psychology

As stated earlier in the chapter, the Swampscott report em- phasized prevention as a deﬁning element of the ﬁeld. Since the Swampscott Conference, the prevention perspective has become institutionalized and formalized within the ﬁeld of community psychology. This institutionalization of preven- tion has occurred through the establishment of prevention- focused conferences, participation of psychologists in federal commissions, and the development of professional organiza- tions and interest groups dedicated to prevention activities. At one such conference, the 1975 Austin Conference, par- ticipants repeatedly expressed the need to identify and mobi- lize the existing strengths and resources in a community as a primary intervention approach (Iscoe, 1975). One working group focused on intervention and preventive models and discussed “competency-based programs” that aimed at in- creasing the capacity of community members.

This encour- aged the growth of “an awareness of professional responsi- bility to the client and community” (Iscoe, 1975, p. 8).

Also in 1975, George Albee, an author of one of the inﬂuential Joint Commission publications (Albee, 1959) convened the First Annual Vermont Conference on Primary Prevention. These conferences, initially funded by the Waters Foundation and later the NIMH, created opportunities for researchers and practitioners to focus on the details of
