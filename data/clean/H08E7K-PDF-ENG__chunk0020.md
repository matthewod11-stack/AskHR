## with your deep-seated values rather than the ﬂeeting expectations

of others. When it is intrinsically motivating, continuous learning

becomes a desirable part of your life’s routine, rather than another

obligatory item on your to-do list. To take it a step further, develop

an emotional context around the learning, and the work involved will

become a source of inspiration instead of an unwelcome burden.

I worked with an executive who was always being recommended for

advanced training programs, leadership conferences, and speaking

opportunities as her managers viewed her as someone who could rise

up the ranks, perhaps even to CEO someday. She was ﬂattered by their

sponsorship but also found these activities onerous on top of her job.

She began to wonder whether she even wanted to advance.

To get clearer on what she should do, this executive ﬁrst put aside

what others wanted for her and reﬂected on her own values, which

included a love of solving big problems in her industry and an ambition

to drive change, but also a desire to be more present with her family.

She concluded that moving up the ladder might mean less time with her

family, but also more agency over decisions and where to spend time

than staying in a junior role. And on an emotional level, she felt that

if she could be successful in honoring all of her values across family

and work, it would show her daughter what was possible for women

in business. It was from this emotional context that she reframed the

learning opportunities from things others expected her to enjoy to

experiences she wanted to intentionally leverage for her aspirations.
