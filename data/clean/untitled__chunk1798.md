# The Doctrine of Pneuma

Since living creatures die when they are deprived of air, it followed that the life force must require a substance in the air breathed, which led to the hypothesis of “pneuma,” a superﬁne material essential to life and growth, in which motion is inherent. It was conjectured that pneuma, distin- guished from the psyche or soul, is present at the very begin- ning of life, assists all physiological and psychological functions,andisrenewedbybreathinganddigestion.Because bloodpulsesasifimpelledbyavitalforce,itwasassumedthat pneuma is transported by the blood throughout the body, and further assumed that pneuma is stored in the ventricles of the brain (Brett, 1963). The paper “The Sacred Disease” in the Hippocratic Corpus states that the air breathed in leaves behind in the ventricles of the brain “its vigour and whatever pretains to consciousness and intelligence [and,] the move- ment of the limbs” (Lloyd, 1978, p. 250)—for example, pneuma.“Therefore,whentheblood-vesselsareshutofffrom this supply of air by the accumulation of phlegm . . . the pa- tient loses his voice and his wits” (Ibid, p. 243); hence, the brain is the seat of the “sacred” disease (probably epilepsy). Notethatatthetime,andformanycenturiesafter,thebraintis- sueitselfwasnotbelievedtohaveanypsychologicalfunction.
