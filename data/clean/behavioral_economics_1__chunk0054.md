# D. Importing ‘new’ psychology

The workhorse models in Table 1 draw on a narrow range of cognitive psychology, mostly from

decision research. Other psychological concepts, which are hardly new in psychology but new to economists,

are starting to be applied as well (such as memory, see Wilson 2004).

Attention is perhaps the ultimate scarce cognitive resource. A few studies have started to explore its

implications for economics. Odean and Barber (2005) show that attention-getting events—abnormal trading

volumes or returns, or news events—correlate with purchases by individual investors. Della Vigna and Pollett

(2005) find that markets react less to earnings announcements made on Fridays than on other days; firms seem

to know this and are more likely to release bad news on a Friday. Falkinger (2005) develops a rich model in

which firms must choose signal strength for their products to get the attention of consumers.

16 Tanaka, Camerer and Nguyen (2005) is one study that measures multiple dimensions of time, risk and trust

preferences corresponding to models in Table 1.

Attribution theory describes how people intuitively infer causes from effects. Many studies indicate

systematic misattributions, such as the tendency to overattribute cause to personal actions rather than

exogeneous structural features (Weber et al, 2001). For example, Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) find that

oil company executives are rewarded when oil prices go up, but are not penalized equally penalized when prices

go down. Einav and Yariv (2005) note that authors of economics papers whose names come earlier in a list of

authors benefit disproportionately by various measures, even though the order is almost always alphabetical.

Categorization refers to the way in which the brain forms categories. Mullainathan (2002) shows how

categorization can generate non-Bayesian effects. An important property of categories is that likelihood

evidence which is weak can tip interpretations from one category to another, producing large effects from small

causes. Fryer and Jackson (2004) develop a model of optimal categorization and discuss its application to labor
