It’s also important when working with those in crisis that we

communicate frequently and clearly. When the unthinkable happens,

we often feel blindsided and insecure. When it feels difficult to regain

a sense of control over our lives, receiving information can help. As

John F. Kennedy said, “In a time of turbulence and change, it is

more true than ever that knowledge is power.” Therefore, another type

of support that the organization can provide is frequent and reliable

communication. This communication can take any form, from a text

alert system to a Slack channel dedicated to informing employees about

the crisis at hand to a daily email from the CEO. Whatever you use, it’s

important that the communication be consistent and dependable.
