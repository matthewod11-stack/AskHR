Established companies know they must innovate to ﬁnd growth in the

digital era. So, in recent years, large companies have set up innovation

labs, accelerators, hackathons, and open innovation programs to look

beyond their core, pursue disruptive ideas, iterate, and experiment.

Yet, most of these eﬀorts produce little in the way of results. Corporate

teams are outrun by startups. Innovation labs are shut down after failing

to deliver growth at a scale that matters to the business.
