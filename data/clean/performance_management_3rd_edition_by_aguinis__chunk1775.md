It is important that each score be associated with a narrative description of what each number means; otherwise, evaluators may not understand the meaning and differences between the various scores. For “responsibility,” a score of 1 could be “is mainly responsible for one’s own job performance,” whereas a score of 3 could be “is responsible for the performance of a work unit of at least 20 individuals.” Third, each factor is assigned a weight so that the sum of weights for all factors should be 100%. For example, “skills” may receive a weight of 35%, “experience” 15%, “responsibility” 40%, and “working conditions” 10%.
