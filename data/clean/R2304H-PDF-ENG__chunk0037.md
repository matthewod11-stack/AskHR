## HBR / Magazine Article / Disability as a Source of Competitive Advantage

Distinctive skills frequently go hand in hand with disabilities. For instance, academics have found strong links between autism and aptitude at tasks requiring attention to detail.

To further explore how people with disabilities help ﬁrms strengthen

their appeal, we set up a series of experiments, enlisting 200 individuals

as participants. Half of them were asked to consider purchasing a

customized mug online from a company that had received high ratings

from its customers. The other half were asked the same thing but were

also told that the company employed many people with disabilities. We

then analyzed people’s willingness to pay for the mug.

The fact that the company employed people with disabilities by itself

didn’t increase people’s inclination to pay more for the mug. So we

repeated the experiment with another group of 200 participants, who

were asked to consider buying an engraved necklace. We found much

the same result: The participants weren’t willing to pay more (or less)

for something that was produced by a company that employed disabled

people. They also didn’t rate the quality of the product any higher.

However, in both cases we also tested for general attitudes toward the

company: Did people feel they liked the company? Did they perceive

what in marketing is called a “communal relationship” with it, in the

sense that they would like to see the company succeed, felt happy if it

performed well, and were willing to actively support it? If the company

employed people with disabilities, the answer was yes: Customers were

signiﬁcantly more likely to engage in a communal relationship with it

than they were with a company in the control group.
