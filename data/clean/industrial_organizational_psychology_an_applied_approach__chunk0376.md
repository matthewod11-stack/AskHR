What will happen

Why it will happen

as an example. An I/O psychologist wants to know which method of recruit- ing employees is best. She predicts that employee referrals will result in longer employee tenure (employees staying with the company) than will the other recruitment methods.

Though she is sure about her hypothesis, she is not sure about the reason, as

there are four possible theories or explanations for her hypothesis:

. Applicants referred by a current employee will stay with the company longer because they were given an accurate picture of the job and the company by the person telling them about the job (realistic job preview theory).

. The personalities of applicants using employee referrals are different than the personalities of applicants using other methods to find jobs (differential recruitment-source theory).

. Friends have similar personalities; thus, if one person has the type of

personality that makes her want to stay with her current job, her friend should also like the job in question (personality similarity theory).

. Employees who know someone in a workplace are more quickly

absorbed into the informal system, receive coaching, and have their social needs met (socialization theory).

Thus, even though a study might support a hypothesis, it is still important to determine why the hypothesis is true. In this example, it would be necessary to conduct further studies to determine which of the four theories, if any, best explains the results. This is important because our ability to understand and use the best theory allows us to develop new methods to improve productivity in the
