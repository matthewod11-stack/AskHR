## THE PROGRESS OF PERCEPTUAL RESEARCH 106 BIBLIOGRAPHY 107 REFERENCES 108

perception has been affected by many “schools” of thought. Each has its own major theoretical viewpoint and its own par- ticular set of methodological techniques. Thus, we encounter psychophysicists, gestaltists, functionalists, structuralists, transactionalists, sensory physiologists, analytic introspec- tionists, sensory-tonic theorists, “new look” psychologists, efferent theorists, cognitive theorists, information processors, artiﬁcial intelligence experts, and computational psycholo- gists, to name but a few. There are even theorists (such as some behaviorists) who deny the existence of, or at least deny our ability to study, the conscious event we call perception. How, then, can a single chapter give any coherent treatment of the issues associated with this fundamental aspect of psychology?

Fortunately, a broad overview shows that it is possible to see some unifying perspectives that have evolved through history. Common theoretical perspectives might be expected in this discipline, since most sensory and perception re- searchers are not exclusively bound to one sensory modality. Thus, we ﬁnd Helmholtz and Hering studying both vision and audition, and George von Bekesy, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on hearing, also contributing to studies on vision and touch. Some researchers, such as Fechner, Stevens, Ames, Gibson, Wertheimer, Koffka, Helson, and others, have offered theoretical frameworks that are virtually modality independent and can be tested and explored using visual, auditory, or any other stimulus input. This is not to deny that there are issues that are important to a single sen- sory modality that do not generalize. One instance of a
