# a. Autocratic Management

Autocratic managers maintain a high level of control and decision-making authority within their teams. They make decisions unilaterally and expect their employees to follow instructions without question. This style is most suitable in situations where quick decisions are needed, such as in crisis management or emergency situations. However, autocratic management can lead to a lack of employee empowerment and engagement, as team members may feel disengaged and undervalued due to limited involvement in decision-making processes [7], [8].
