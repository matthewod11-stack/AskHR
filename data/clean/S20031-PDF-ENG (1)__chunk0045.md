# CHANGING THE CULTURE

The changes we propose address shortcomings of the programs that the Supreme Court backed in 1998. But reducing harassment will require more than that. It will require changing the culture of your organization so that fighting harassment becomes part of your mission. Youâ€™ll need to engage as many people as possible in the effort and create systems of accountability that get everyone involved in oversight.

Three tools offer promising ways to do that: train-the-trainer programs that turn employees into harassment experts; harassment task forces that put employ- ees in charge of diagnosing problems and designing solutions; and openly published numbers so that everyone can track prog ress.
