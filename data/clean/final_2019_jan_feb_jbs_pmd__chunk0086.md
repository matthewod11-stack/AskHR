is no longer a concern for “Generation Y” employees due to their propensity towards changing their jobs regularly, talent retention has turned out to be a serious problem for the HR managers. These employees focus more on employability as opposed to employment, thereby exerting pressure on organizations to impart them continuous professional advancement opportunities. Furthermore, a remarkable development during the past years is that employees not anymore dedicate or confide their employment to one employer. They embrace a proactive approach, looking for organizations with the best professiona l advancement criterion (Mirvis and Hall, 1994; Sullivan, 1999; Roehling et al., 2000; Tanskey and Cohen, 2001). This has led to a worldwide battle amongst corporations for developing and encompassing appropriate talent development mechanisms into their frameworks.

Human resource managers, the world over, have realized that talent development has turned out crucial for business growth (Cook and Macaulay 2009; Kim and McLean 2012). In developing strategies to this end, they burn the candle at both ends and for a little while the development of talent has assumed a significant role for organizational advancement.

All such elements bring forth talent development - as a subject field, at the top of the priority list. However, there are relatively scant and fragmented scholarly papers that centralize quintessentially on talent development (Garavanet al., 2012). It is with this objective that this study was proposed. Studies and researches relevant to the topic were systematically reviewed to further examine this domain.

Analysis of literature indicated that several researchers and academicians have described talent development with an array of ideas and thoughts that identify gaps for a great deal of uncertainty and lack of transparency about what organizations characterize as talent, it s applicability and the overall objectives of talent development and thus pose a danger to its implementation.We expect that through the empirical observations accrued from the numerous papers and articles we will clarify the challenges encountered i n the development of talent and the difficulties faced by

the organization and its manpower in the direction of a framework based on talent. The paper also critically examines the range of TD interventions available to organizations.

- 4. What is ‘‘Talent’’? Collings and Mellahi (2009) claimed that talent contributes significantly to the overall organizational accomplishment.But what is ‘‘talent’’?A discourse on talent development would be impaired in the absence of an interpretation of the term “talent”.Talent in broad terms relates to the aptitudes, abilities or the art that a person acquires in a certain profession or domain.

Howe et al., (1998), Tansley (2011) and CIPD (2007) revealed that the word ‘talent’ has been used since ancient times; and also stated that it has differen t understandings and perceptions, all of which depend heavily on situations, persons, and organizations.
