## The Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century

The Hôpital General of Paris was established to segregate socially dependent or disruptive individuals from society. La Bicêtre, for men, and the Salpêtrière, for women, often described as asylums for the insane, were both large general hospitals for the poor with only a few wards for the insane. There were many paths into institutions other than that of mental illness.A1690 regulation decreed that children (up to age 25) of artisans and other poor inhabitants of Paris who “used their parents badly,” refused to work because of lazi- ness, or, in the case of girls, were debauched, were to be conﬁned—the boys in the Bicêtre, the girls in the Salpêtrière (Rosen, 1968).

The ﬁrst European institutions speciﬁcally for lunatics were established during the eighteenth century. The methods of treatment were those traditional from the classical period—bloodletting, emetics, purgatives, and blisters raised on the patients’ bodies in order to draw off corrupted hu- mors. St. Patrick’s Hospital was founded in 1746 in Dublin with the legacy left by Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), dean of St. Patrick’s. Swift, known for his satire Gulliver’s Travels, was deeply concerned about the problems of mental illness. He willed most of his estate for the foundation of a “House for Fools and Mad.” Lunatic asylums were founded some- what later in other large cities.
