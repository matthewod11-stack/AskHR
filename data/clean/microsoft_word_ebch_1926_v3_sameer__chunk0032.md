# INTRODUCTION

Motivating people to achieve personal ambitions, organisational objectives, and, to some extent, the aspirations of their countries is a critical component of all businesses, whether they are privately held or publicly traded. There are numerous theories of motivation, and most of them relate to or have an impact on the results of employee job satisfaction. According to Saif, Nawaz, Jan, and Khan, there are three primary sorts of theories: content theories, process theories, and current theories. Maslow's hierarchy of requirements, Herzberg's motivator-hygiene (or two- factor) theory, Alderfer's Existence, Relatedness and Growth theory, and McClelland's needs theory are examples of these theories in general. Process theories, which include the Porter- Lawler model and Vroom's expectation theory, describe how motivation arises and how it results in satisfaction[1], [2].

Goal-setting, reinforcement, and work design theory are all included in modern theories of motivation, in addition to equity, control, and agency theory. The theories of motivation may be grouped based on their definitions and goals, but a critical investigation shows that they are all interconnected and contribute to workers feeling satisfied in their work. Effective employee motivation requires the application of both content and process ideas. When it comes to extrinsic motivation, elements (hygiene) that fully or partially satiate higher-level wants are different from those that merely partially satiate lower-level needs. Employees become unsatisfied if hygiene elements (factors beyond the job itself, such as working conditions, remuneration, and incentive pay) are insufficient. The manager who wants to develop a self-motivated workforce should place more emphasis on job content or motivating reasons than on hygiene.
