# productive.

This weekly event doesn’t have to be longer than 30 minutes. In the ﬁrst

meeting, begin by outlining your goals for the year and where you see

the biggest bottlenecks. Is there something you wish you knew about

your customers? Are there sales spikes or sudden drops that mystify

you? What concerns you about your next advertising campaign?
