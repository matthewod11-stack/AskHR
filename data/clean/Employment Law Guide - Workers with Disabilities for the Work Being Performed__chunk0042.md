In addition to the recordkeeping requirements imposed on all employers subject to the FLSA, those paying

subminimum wages to workers with disabilities under Section 14(c) must also maintain records regarding the

disabilities of the workers, prevailing wage surveys, work measurements, and individual productivity. See the following for the general FLSA recordkeeping requirements.

Every employer covered by the FLSA must keep certain records. Employers must keep records on wages,

hours, and other information as set forth in the Department of Labor's regulations. Most of this data is the type

that employers generally maintain in ordinary business practice.
