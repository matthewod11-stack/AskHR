# 186 PERSONALITY AND WORK

LePine and Van Dyne (2001) also suggest that a very agreeable team member may evoke feelings of empathy in teammates, in- creasing the likelihood that they will direct their efforts toward training behavior.

Other traits have not generally been examined in terms of their inﬂuence on teammates. For instance, the inclusion of a highly extraverted team member is likely to alter the entire setting because extraverts compete with others and create a less coopera- tive environment (Barrick, Stewart, & Piotrowski, 2002). It also seems possible that an emotionally unstable individual can change the environment, creating an environment of mistrust and anxi- ety. Such an effect of creating mistrust can be particularly harmful because team trust has been identiﬁed as an important factor for eliminating dysfunctional conﬂict in teams (Simons & Peterson, 2000). Studying the impact of a team member’s traits through the impact on other team members thus appears to be an area where future research is likely to be enlightening. Indeed, an under- standing of the dynamic interplay among team members is likely to provide substantial insight into how personality traits have unique effects in team settings.

Another theoretical perspective that can provide insight con- cerns the effects of situational strength and autonomy. Some settings provide strong situations where behavior is mostly a function of en- vironment rather than traits. Other settings provide very weak situ- ations where the inﬂuence of traits is relatively strong in comparison to the environment (Kenrick & Funder, 1988). The best established moderator in individual settings is perhaps autonomy. Barrick and Mount (1993) found stronger trait-behavior relationships for set- tings with high autonomy. A common feature of teams is increased autonomy, suggesting that trait-behavior relationships should gen- erally be enhanced in team settings. The autonomy created by teams needs closer examination before drawing this conclusion.

Higher autonomy at the team level does not necessarily trans- late to higher autonomy at the individual level. Barker (1993) stud- ied manufacturing teams that were collectively given high levels of team autonomy, which they used to create norms and rules that tightly controlled individual behavior. Autonomy at the team level should therefore not be assumed to equal autonomy at the indi- vidual level. The introduction of empowered teams into an orga-
