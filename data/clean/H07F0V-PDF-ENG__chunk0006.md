We all know that layoffs are hard. They create stress, worry, and

ﬁnancial instability, not to mention grief over a job that you loved, or

colleagues you miss. Unfortunately, layoﬀs are fairly common. In the

U.S., approximately 40 percent of Americans have been laid oﬀ at least

once in their career. You don’t even have to be laid oﬀ to feel anxious

about it; simply knowing that you could be next, or saying goodbye to

colleagues can spark layoﬀ anxiety.
