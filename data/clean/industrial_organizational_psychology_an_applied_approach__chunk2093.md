## Are Rewards and Resources Given Equitably?

Another factor related to motivation and job satisfaction is the extent to which employees perceive that they are being treated fairly. The first theory on this topic was equity theory (Adams, ). Equity theory is based on the premise that our levels of motivation and job satisfaction are related to how fairly we believe we are treated in comparison with others. If we believe we are treated unfairly, we attempt to change our beliefs or behaviors until the situation appears to be fair. Three components are involved in this perception of fairness: inputs, outputs, and input/output ratio.

Inputs are those personal elements that we put into our jobs. Obvious ele- ments are time, effort, education, and experience. Less obvious elements include money spent on child care and distance driven to work.

Outputs are those elements that we receive from our jobs. A list of obvious outputs includes pay, benefits, challenge, and responsibility. Less obvious outputs are benefits such as friends and office furnishings.

According to the theory, employees subconsciously list all their outputs and inputs and then compute an input/output ratio by dividing output value by input value. By itself, this ratio is not especially useful. But employees then compute the input/output ratios for other employees and for previous work experiences and compare them with their own. For example, imagine that Brad is paid $, as a nurse at County General Hospital. He works  hours each week, mostly in the evening and on weekends. He is considered to be one of the most skilled nurses at the hospital and, as a result, is often assigned to the most difficult patients. He has  years of nursing experience. Tom is also a nurse at County General mak- ing $, a year. He works : a.m. to : p.m. and has ten years of nurs- ing experience. When comparing inputs and outputs, Brad would realize that he receives the same outputs as Tom, but has more inputs (worse schedule, more years of experience), thus his ratio would be lower than Tom’s. So what will Brad do? According to equity theory, when an employee’s ratio is lower than those of others, he will become dissatisfied and be motivated to make the ratios equal in one or more ways.

First, employees can seek greater outputs by such means as asking for a raise or for more responsibility. Second, employees can make the ratio more equal by reducing their inputs. Thus they might not work as hard or might reduce their attendance.

A less practical way of equalizing the ratios would be to change the ratios of other employees. For example, employees might try to get another employee to work harder and thus increase that employee’s inputs. Or they might try to reduce the outputs of another employee by withholding friendship or finding a way to reduce the other employee’s bonuses. Fortunately, however, strategies to equalize input/output ratios seldom involve reducing others’ outputs. Employ- ees can also restore equity by rationalizing the input/output ratio differences, changing the person with whom they are comparing themselves, or leaving the organization.

In general, research has supported the idea that our motivation decreases when our input/output ratios are lower than others’ (Feight, Ferguson, Rodriguez, & Simmons, ). For example, research on major league baseball players (Hauenstein & Lord, ; Lord & Hohenfeld, ) found that players who either had their salary cut during their first year of free agency or lost an arbitration case performed at lower levels the following year. Thus players who thought that their output (salary) was too low responded by reducing their inputs (performance). In a study of professional basketball players, Harder () found that overpaid players responded by being more team oriented (e.g., passing the ball, rebounding), whereas underpaid players responded by being more selfish (e.g., taking shots).

In an interesting study, O’Reilly and Puffer () found that employees’ motivation increased when coworkers received appropriate sanctions for their behavior. That is, when a high-performing group member was rewarded or a poor-performing group member was punished, the satisfaction and motivation of the group increased.

The degree of inequity that an employee feels when underpaid appears to be a function of whether the employee chose the actions that resulted in under- payment (Cropanzano & Folger, ). That is, if an employee chooses to work harder than others who are paid the same, he will not feel cheated, but if he is pressured into working harder for the same pay, he will be unhappy.

An interesting prediction from this theory is a situation in which an employ- ee’s input/output ratio is higher than the ratio of others. Because the theory is based on equity, the prediction would be that the employee would still strive for equal ratios by either increasing his inputs or decreasing his outputs. In other words, he would either work harder or ask to be paid less. In fact, research has indicated that employees often do respond to being “overpaid” by feeling guilty (Lapidus & Pinkerton, ) or working harder (Adams & Rosenbaum, ; Pritchard, Dunnette, & Jorgenson, ). But feelings of inequity caused by being “overpaid” do not last long and probably do not produce long-term changes in behavior (Carrell & Dittrich, ).

Though equity theory has some theoretical problems, it was the spring- board for modern research in organizational justice. Though this topic will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter , the idea behind organizational justice is that if employees are treated fairly, they will be more satisfied and motivated. Whereas equity theory was limited to work outcomes such as pay and promotions, organizational justice theory has focused on the fairness of many aspects of work such as the process of how decisions are made (procedural justice), the outcomes of the decisions (distributive justice), and the way in which decisions and other information are communicated to employees ( interactional justice).
