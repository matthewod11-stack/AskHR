## the employees better than the executives or human resource managers

designing policies do. One member of a Dell global team, who has been

working remotely for more than 10 years from Europe with a boss in

Texas, told us that, when the company announced that employees had

less than a month to choose between working at least three days in the

oﬃce or else becoming ineligible for promotion or changing divisions,

several reasons were given in terms of what is right and what works—

abstract arguments about the right of employers to set the conditions

of how and where work gets done and the importance of presence

in the oﬃce for learning, creativity, and culture-building. None of the

arguments addressed what matters.

When the announcement was made, the Dell team member told us,

there was a lot of agitation on their work group chats: “Everybody

posted and the messages showed a mix of despair, frustration,

unhappiness, and a feeling of unfairness. People didn’t trust the

company.” The policy was strict: Time in the oﬃce would be tracked

by badging; if you were sick one week, you had to work in the oﬃce

extra days to make up for it. People suddenly faced long commutes and

had to ﬁnd childcare solutions.
