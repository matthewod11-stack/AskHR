# relationship between servant leadership and affective but not cognitive trust. Empirical

studies investigating the relationship between the different bases of trust and performance

also show mixed results with some studies reporting that affective trust is a more powerful

antecedent (e.g., Miao et al., 2014; Yang & Mossholder, 2010), while others report cognitive

trust has a stronger relationship with performance (e.g., Zhu & Akhtar, 2014a; Yang et al.,

2009). Taken together, the literature on the differential impact of trust bases is by no means

consistent and at the team level, a meta-analysis suggested the two bases demonstrate similar

relationships with performance related outcomes (de Jong et al., 2016). Given this

inconsistency, a key aim of our meta-analysis to explore the empirical evidence for affective

and cognitive trust having different functional relationships with leadership styles and

performance related outcomes. We hypothesise:

Hypothesis 3: Cognitive and affective trust will provide unique mediating roles in the

relationship between leadership styles and performance related outcomes.
