## HBR / Digital Article / Get Clearer, More Actionable Feedback

actionable or clear. Without speciﬁcs or concrete examples, you’re left

guessing what success looks like and at a loss for exactly what to change.

This happened to Maya, Managing Editor at a media company, who

was trying to parse through her latest performance review. During

the session, her boss had said, “Everything seems to be on track, but

keep pushing for innovation.” On the surface, this sounded somewhat

encouraging, but as someone responsible for shaping coverage and

developing talent, Maya needed more speciﬁcs. Was she driving the

right long-term priorities? Were there unspoken concerns she should be

addressing?

The higher you advance, the more common this kind of ambiguity

becomes. The executives, board members, or clients you report to

are often busy, and the feedback they give tends to focus on softer,

more subjective qualities. Things like “acting as a thought partner,”

“motivating through vision,” and “driving alignment” are often hard

to deﬁne and even harder to measure. In an ideal world, feedback on

these behaviors would be delivered with precision and in a way that’s

immediately useful. But the leaders you work closely with, like all of us,

are imperfect humans operating in imperfect conditions. Your boss may

be overwhelmed, an abstract thinker who struggles getting down to the

nitty-gritty details, or someone who simply never received training.

Nevertheless, you can’t aﬀord to let vague feedback slide, because the

impact doesn’t stop with you. The lack of clarity trickles down to aﬀect

your team’s priorities, slows decision-making, and creates confusion

across the organization. Translating vague input into actionable insight

is a skill. Here’s how to get the direction you need from your manager.
