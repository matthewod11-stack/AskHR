## The Section on Women and Psychology of the Canadian Psychological Association

The turbulence of the 1970s was felt within the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) just as in its American counterpart. In 1975, upon the recommendation of its presi- dent, Mary Wright, the CPA established a Task Force on the

Status of Women in Canadian Psychology. The task force presented almost 100 recommendations to the board of direc- tors in 1976. Included among them was a recommendation to establish a special-interest group on the psychology of women. This special-interest group, now called the Section on Women and Psychology (SWAP), is the second largest of the CPAâ€™s 26 sections (Pyke, 1993). SWAP holds a daylong institute prior to the annual CPA convention for the presenta- tion of scholarly research and discussions on the psychology of women. SWAP also publishes a newsletter. The CPA has formally approved several initiatives undertaken by SWAP. These include guidelines on the elimination of sexual harass- ment, the conduct of nonsexist research, and the provision of sex-fair counseling and therapy.
