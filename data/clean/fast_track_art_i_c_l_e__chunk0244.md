# Study Limitations

The large sample size for this study increases the likelihood that our ﬁndings can be generalized to other organizations.

There is little recent data concerning what proportion of companies in America offer EHM programs, much less EHM best practices, but the last such national survey suggested that a small minority of companies take a comprehensive approach to EHM.52 Accordingly, this analysis of best practices may be less relevant to organizations offering a piecemeal approach to employee wellness. Some of the ﬁndings from the study, at ﬁrst blush, seem to contradict conventional assumptions about best practices.
