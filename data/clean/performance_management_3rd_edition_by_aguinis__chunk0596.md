# 4.1 DEFINING PERFORMANCE

Performance management systems usually include measures of both behaviors (what an employee does) and results (the outcomes of an employee’s behavior). The definition of performance does not include the results of an employee’s behaviors but only the behaviors themselves. Performance is about behavior or what employees do, not about what employees produce or the outcomes of their work.

Also, there are two additional characteristics of the behaviors we label “perform- ance.”1 First, they are evaluative. This means that such behaviors can be judged as negative, neutral, or positive for individual and organizational effectiveness. In other words, the value of these behaviors can vary based on whether they make a contribution toward the accomplishment of individual, unit, and organizational goals. Second, performance is multidimensional.2 This means that there are many different kinds of behaviors that have the capacity to advance (or hinder) organizational goals.

As an example, consider a set of behaviors that can be grouped under the general label “contribution to effectiveness of others in the work unit.” This set of behaviors can be defined as follows:

Works with others within and outside the unit in a manner that improves their effectiveness; shares information and resources; develops effective working relationships; builds consensus; and constructively manages conflict.

Contribution to the effectiveness of others in the work unit could be assessed by using a scale including anchors demonstrating various levels of competence. For example, anchors could be words and phrases such as “outstanding,” “significantly exceeds standards,” “fully meets standards,” “does not fully meet standards,” and “unacceptable.” This illustrates the evaluative nature of performance because this set of behaviors is judged as positive, neutral, or negative. In addition, this example illustrates the multidimensional nature of performance because there are several behaviors that, combined, affect the overall perceived contribution that an employee makes to the effectiveness of others in the work unit. In other words, we would be missing important information if we only considered, for example, “shares information and resources” and did not consider the additional behaviors listed earlier.

Because not all behaviors are observable or measurable, performance management systems often include measures of results or consequences that we infer are the direct result of employees’ behaviors. Take the case of a salesperson whose job consists of visiting
