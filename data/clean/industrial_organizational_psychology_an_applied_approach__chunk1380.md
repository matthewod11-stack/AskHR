noted that the Hausknecht et al. meta-analysis was limited to cognitive ability tests. It appears that with knowledge tests, retaking the test will still increase tests scores, but the increase is at the same level whether the second test is the same test or an alternate form of the same test (Raymond, Neustel, & Anderson, ).

Multiple forms also might be used in large groups of test-takers where there is a possibility of cheating. Perhaps one of your professors has used more than one form of the same test to discourage cheating. The last time you took your written driver’s test, multiple forms probably were used, just as they were when you took the SAT or ACT to be admitted to college. As you can see, multiple forms of a test are common.

Recall that with test-retest reliability, the time interval between administra- tions usually ranges from  days to  months. With alternate-forms reliability, however, the time interval should be as short as possible. If the two forms are administered  weeks apart and a low correlation results, the cause of the low reliability is difficult to determine. That is, the test could lack either form stability or temporal stability. Thus, to determine the cause of the unreliability, the inter- val needs to be short. The average correlation between alternate forms of tests used in industry is . (Hood, ).

In addition to being correlated, two forms of a test should also have the same mean and standard deviation (Clause, Mullins, Nee, Pulakos, & Schmitt, ). The test in Table ., for example, shows a perfect correlation between the two forms. People who scored well on Form A also scored well on Form B. But the average score on Form B is two points higher than on Form A. Thus, even though the perfect correlation shows that the scores on the two forms are parallel, the difference in mean scores indicates that the two forms are not equivalent. In such a case, either the forms must be revised or different standards (norms) must be used to interpret the results of the test.
