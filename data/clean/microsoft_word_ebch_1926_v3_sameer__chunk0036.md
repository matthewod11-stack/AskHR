# Inspiration

Motivation was defined by Locke as "a pleasurable or positive emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one's job experiences". This description specifically highlights two elements: an employee's emotional connection to their work and the employer's deliberate review of their performance. According to David and Andrzej, motivation can be viewed as cognitive decision- making with the intention to initiate and monitor behavior with the aim of accomplishing a specific goal. At work, reviews are conducted using appraisals, and these appraisals have predetermined standards.

The outcome of an assessment may cause an emotional response in the employee, and this response will determine whether the person is satisfied or unhappy. Positive review scores may indicate that an employee is content, while negative scores may indicate the opposite. Every employee may be motivated by either intrinsic (comes from within the person) or extrinsic (comes from outside the person) elements, such as rewards.

- 1. Job Contentment

As motivated employees will have a job satisfaction, we must first define it in order to better grasp the foundations of motivation. According to Kumar and Singh an employee's view of how effectively his work satisfies his needs that is, how well expectations are met or even exceeded determines whether he feels satisfied at work or not. No matter the actual context or circumstances, job satisfaction is an intangible emotional reaction that cannot be directly observed. The definition of job satisfaction given by Jehanzeb, Rasheed, Rasheed, and Amir was similar, defining it as "a sensation employees have about their work environment and their expectations towards work." Employees will respond to their work environment by becoming productive depending on the rewards and incentives they receive and management's motivations for providing them. Keeping in mind that in a diverse workplace with male and female employees from various age groups, generations, and (to some extent) backgrounds, as well as with varying qualifications or experience, no single element will produce either universal approval or collective disapproval, organizations must be seen to support employees in their day- to-day work in order to bring about loyalty and improve retention[5], [6].
