# Playing the Game Comes at a Cost

The political double bind also inﬂuences individual motivation and

stress. Speciﬁcally, research published in the British Journal of

Management in 2013 ﬁnds that women view organizational politics

as an expression of masculine culture. Responses to it range from

reluctance to resistance and ﬁnally acceptance. This acceptance is

based on the awareness that these are the rules of the game. To obtain

functional beneﬁts, like access to lucrative relationships and coalitions,

women and ethnic minorities should engage in political tactics — even

if there is no guarantee of success.

Political behaviors are the standard for how things get done in

organizations, leaving individuals with little choice but to engage. This

comes at a cost. Research has found women who engage in oﬃce

politics often consider it emotionally draining, and anecdotal evidence

suggests that women may even reject leadership roles because of their

dislike of oﬃce politics. Future research needs to investigate whether

this holds true for minority groups as well as white men, as we may ﬁnd

that oﬃce politics is really an outdated game that no one wants to play.

Given the challenges that organizational politics creates for women

and racial minorities, perhaps we should stop implementing programs

aimed at improving political skill — since it doesn’t seem the problem

is a lack of skill — and instead focus on creating environments that

support individuals engaging in a diverse range of behaviors.

What would this environment look like? One place to start is

collaboration. Research published in the Journal of Applied Psychology
