# developments and practices in the supply chain indicate exploration of the overlapping

concepts and interactive relationship study as a prime methodology. The literature study

establishes the reconfigurable practices as of fundamental position under whatever scenario

subjected to and can be applied to other significant research angles under different

orientations. In this sense, leagile, flexible, resilient, digital, and sustainable practices can be

incorporated into a single reconfiguration framework with practices from different paradigms.

Moreover, current research practices' drivers are continuously evolving;

therefore,

reconfiguration prospects must be explored under such situations. As a system of several

systems, the supply chain will be under dynamic uncertainties, and disruptions may become a

new norm. The task under such a situation would be increasingly complex to generate a
