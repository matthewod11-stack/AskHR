## the unrelenting nature of competition, companies must continually

improve how they deploy expertise to remain relevant. We’ve seen

the competitive advantage of many incumbents erode when new

expertise becomes critical for success in a market. In 2007 Nokia was

the global leader in mobile phones, commanding 40% of the market.

Its competitive advantage stemmed from expertise in hardware and

a highly tuned manufacturing process, which allowed the company

to achieve huge economies of scale and scope. The smartphone era

that followed required other types of expertise, especially in software.

Unable to build the expertise to design and foster a cohesive software

ecosystem, Nokia (along with the established phone manufacturers

Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and BlackBerry) quickly lost virtually all its

share to device manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung, which used

iOS and Android to run their phones.
