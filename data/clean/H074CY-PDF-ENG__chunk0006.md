Dissatisfaction with performance appraisals is pervasive. They are

seen as time-consuming, demotivating, inaccurate, biased, and unfair.

A McKinsey survey indicates most CEOs don’t ﬁnd the appraisal process

in their companies helps to identify top performers, while over half of

employees think their managers don’t get the performance review right.

A Gallup study is more negative: Just one in ﬁve employees agreed that

their company’s performance practices motivated them.
