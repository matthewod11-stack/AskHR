# So What? Now What?

A review is incomplete without a discussion of next steps in which

both parties take appropriate responsibility for change options. But

responsibility for this closure rests with the manager. On what assets

can you capitalize to increase eï¬€ectiveness? Are there assignments that

can increase learning, deliberate practice, or other elements relevant to

core tasks? Can HR help? What is the timetable and benchmarks to use

in measuring progress after the review?
