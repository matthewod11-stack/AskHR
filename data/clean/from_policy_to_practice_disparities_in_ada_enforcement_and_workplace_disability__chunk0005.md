1.1 Background and Rationale The right to disability in the workplace is part and parcel of human rights and social justice. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 27 percent of the adult community in the United States has one form of disability. Although there is an increase in the representation of individuals with disabilities in the population, highly unfair employment opportunities are still encountered by individuals with disabilities (Iezzoni et al., 2022). Although laws at the federal level have tried to tackle this asymmetry, the differences between the various states in the protection and enforcement of workers remain glaring. In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became a ground-breaking civil rights legislation intended to abolish discrimination based on disability in every aspect of public life, including employment (Saleh & Bruyère, 2023). Nevertheless, for more than three decades, there have been signs that the aforementioned is a lie, and that a rather disturbing rift exists between the theoretical policy of ADA and its implementation, which is especially evident at the state level. Due to differences in understanding the interpretation of the law, resource allocations, and the compliance of employers to laws and state policy on finding disabled workers, there have been varied encounters of disabled employees throughout the country. The need to discover and critically assess these disparities leads to the motivation of this study. Whereas available literature has been on the general compliance of ADA, little research has been done on the variations of enforcement and application of the ADA across various states and the consequences of this disparity on the employment outcomes of disabled individuals (McCoy et al., 2023). This legal gap is more than a problem of legal analysis; it is also an issue of public policy. Filling that gap between the federal policy and state execution is the best pathway to ensuring effective inclusion of the American people, both north and south, in the work environment. 1.2 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): An Overview ADA was enacted on July 26, 1990, and forms one of the most comprehensive civil rights acts of legislation that safeguards the people with disabilities. The Act prohibition discrimination on the grounds of employment, transportation, accommodations, communications, and participation in state as well as local governmental programs and services (Gould et al., 2025). Title I of the ADA is very interesting to this journal because it particularly deals as a separate act with employment discrimination. Subscribed in Title I, employers with 15 or more employees must offer equal employment opportunities to qualified persons with disabilities. This comprises making accommodations in the most sensible ways, not discriminating against hiring, and securing against intimidation or punishment. Title I of the ADA is administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a federal agency, which is authorized to enforce this legislation. It examines grievances, mediates or initiates lawsuits, and makes rulings for both employers and employees. Enforcement,
