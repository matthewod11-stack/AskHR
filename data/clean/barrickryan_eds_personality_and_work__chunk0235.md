# 68 PERSONALITY AND WORK

striving, which in turn has universal applicability to work in all jobs, the expectation is that these two traits would be valid predictors in all, or nearly all, jobs.

Turning to the two interpersonal personality traits, Extraver- sion and Agreeableness are expected to affect job performance through our other two cognitive-motivational work intentions: Sta- tus Striving and Communion Striving. Lucas, Diener, Grob, Suh, and Shao (2000) demonstrate that the core features of Extraver- sion are energy, ascendance, and ambition. The primary essence of Extraversion is thus a sensitivity to obtaining rewards rather than sociability. In fact, they argue that sociability appears to be an im- portant feature of Extraversion because it provides more oppor- tunities to achieve status and rewards. Consequently, Extraversion will be related to Status Striving rather than Communion Striving. In contrast, the fundamental features of Agreeableness appear to be primarily related to afﬁliation and friendliness (Digman, 1990). Consequently, Agreeableness will be linked to personal strivings that contribute to Communion Striving and not to those related to Status Striving.

Conﬁrmation for these relationships between personality and motivational strivings is found in a recent study by Barrick et al. (2002). In a study of 164 sales representatives, Barrick et al. demon- strated that Conscientiousness (r = .39) and Emotional Stability (r = .15) were signiﬁcantly related to Accomplishment Striving. Ex- traversion was correlated with Status Striving (r = .48) and Agree- ableness with Communion Striving (r = .15). Barrick et al. also examined the links among Accomplishment Striving, Communion Striving, and Status Striving. In accordance with the model pre- sented in Figure 3.1, Accomplishment Striving and Status Striving were related to performance. Similarly, as expected, Communion Striving in this competitive sales setting, was not related to perfor- mance. Furthermore, as suggested in Figure 3.1, Status Striving me- diated the relationship between Accomplishment Striving and performance. As we explain below, we expect similar mediation through Communion Striving in cooperative settings. People thus appear to be ultimately motivated to accomplish tasks in order to achieve either communion or status, depending on their traits and the situational context.
