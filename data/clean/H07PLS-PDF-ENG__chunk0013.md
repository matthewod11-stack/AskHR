## Embrace the discomfort of the learning process

Many leaders tell me that, after witnessing an employee falter, taking

back the work felt like the most supportive thing to do. I’ve felt this

tension too. But Valerie taught me the power of holding space for

struggle. Yes, this creates discomfort for both leader and employee

because it’s a new way of working for everyone. However, as Gallup

reminds us, one of the keys to engagement at work is the opportunity for

stimulating challenges. And when you push through the struggle, the

result is growth for all parties.

How can you embrace, rather than resist, the discomfort of learning?
