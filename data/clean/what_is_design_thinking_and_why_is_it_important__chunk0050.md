# Summary and Discussion

In this article, we reviewed the literature related to design thinking. Expert designers are solution focused rather than problem focused. This appears to be a feature of design thinking that comes with education and experience in designing (Cross, 2004). Specifically, building experience in a particular domain allows designers to quickly identify the problem and propose a solution. Generating, syn- thesizing, and evaluating a solution are frequently identified as key features of design expertise. Some research studies (e.g., Dorst & Cross, 2001; Guindon, 1990) have found that creative and productive design behavior seems to be associ- ated with frequent switching of types of cognitive activity (e.g., analysis, synthe- sis). Designers should be able to assess the conditions of a given situation and quickly adjust their actions depending on the current set of needs (Stempfle & Badke-Schaube, 2002).

Helping students to think like designers may better prepare them to deal with difficult situations and to solve complex problems in school, in their careers, and in life in general. Current educational practices, though, typically adhere to out- dated theories of learning and pedagogy, evidenced by a so-called content fetish (Gee, 2005). That is, schools continue to focus on increasing studentsâ€™ proficiency in traditional subjects such as math and reading, via didactic approaches, which leaves many students disengaged. We can and should move beyond that limited
