## HBR / Digital Article / How Small Companies Can Offer Great Paid-Leave Programs

Be consistent and communicate openly. Don’t just sweeten paid leave

beneﬁts for new recruits, Sias advised. Make sure the same beneﬁt is available to new talent and current employees. “As employers, it’s not just what you do to get people in the door, it’s the lifecycle of the employee,

and…people talk.” If you communicate about these and other policy issues

openly as they evolve and demonstrate you are being responsive to your

team’s feedback and needs, you’ll build a culture of trust.

Be a voice in the public policy debate. Small businesses employ 49.2%

of the U.S. workforce and 43% of high-tech talent. As more states craft

statewide paid leave policies and momentum builds for a national paid

leave policy, small businesses must become educated and involved in

crafting these policies to ensure their needs are addressed. Vlietstra

Wonnenberg said, “They have to ﬁnd a way to insert themselves in the

conversation — by they themselves being an advocate, or joining a

business organization that aligns with their view.”

It’s important to remember your organization’s leave policy affects your

reputation. Human resources executive Diane Irving, who has spent more

than 25 years in STEM ﬁelds, put it plainly: “Is this a generous

organization or is this not a generous organization? You get a reputation…

There’s a competition for talent and it may tip the scale.”

As the pandemic rages on, it’s becoming increasingly clear that if small

businesses and tech ﬁrms want to recruit and retain the best talent

possible, they need a competitive paid leave policy. As Nicholas Christakis

of Yale University states, “The dynamics of a contagious disease made it

abundantly clear…[that] paid sick leave…[and] such policies are likely to

endure after the virus subsides, either because companies see the wisdom

of it, lawmakers enforce it, or workers demand it.”
