# Create cross-functional connections.

Dispersed employees tend to lack shared context, from body language to

shared kitchen snacks to inside jokes. They also often have less visibility

into what’s happening across teams, which can lead to confusion and an

“us vs. them” attitude between functions.

Managers should look to build bridges with other teams in their

organization. Try to create opportunities for remote employees to work

on cross-functional projects (people tend to feel closest to the people

they work with the most) or connect your team members to people

from another department for informal chats. You might say something

like, “Tracy, Kim’s expertise is related to what you’ve been focusing on.

Why not set up time with her this week to get her thoughts? Happy

to make the intro.” You can also regularly host colleagues from other

departments at your team meeting to talk about their work, how your

teams partner, and what they’re excited to learn from your reports.

Finally, make it a priority to take notes during important meetings

and share them, either in a folder or summarized in a public channel.

Among hybrid and virtual teams, careful documentation is especially

important in boosting performance and trust.

Make a list, and check it twice.

It’s easy to fall into the “out-of-sight, out-of-mind” trap when you don’t

have much in-person time with your team. In other words, you’re more

likely to reach out to the people you’ve worked with the longest or who

speak up the most in team meetings. This bias can lead you to measure

and reward access rather than performance.

To combat this bias, when you’re evaluating who to delegate work to

or who might be best suited for an exciting opportunity, don’t just

go with the ﬁrst person who pops into your head. Write down every
