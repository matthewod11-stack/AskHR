# ECOLOGICALTHEORY

As noted in the introduction, community psychology was cultivated during a period in which social inequalities were being challenged because of their link to the health and men- tal illness of individuals and the disintegration of communi- ties. Commensurate with this philosophy of social change experienced at a societal level, community psychologists have advocated for understanding “human competencies and problems . . . within the social, cultural, and historical con- text” (Meritt et al., 1997, p. 74). This orientation, discussed in terms of an ecological framework, represents one of the major theoretical frameworks guiding the ﬁeld of community psychology. This framework reﬂects a focus on the strengths

of individuals and a value in keeping communities healthy as a means of improving the human condition. Representing the current consensus on the importance of ecological context is this quote from Kenneth Maton’s 1999 Society for Commu- nity Research and Action Presidential Address: “Change in individuals alone, transient changes in setting environments, and interventions that do not ultimately impact community and societal environments cannot in and of themselves make much of a difference” (Maton, 2000, p. 26). This section will review the 35-year evolution of theory and methods that articulate the relationship between the individual and her or his surrounding environment within the ﬁeld.

Examining individual behavior embedded in various so- cial contexts has been a deﬁning feature of community psy- chology even before the ﬁeld’s “ofﬁcial conception” in 1965 (Bennett et al., 1966). During the 1950s, environmental fac- tors became widely acknowledged as substantial forces that had impacted individual behavior and adjustment during World War II as mental health professionals began to under- stand the impact of war experiences on veterans’ mental health (see this chapter’s opening section; Duffy & Wong, 1996; Ridenour, 1961; Sarason, 1978; Strother, 1987). Also during this period, Kurt Lewin (1951), a social psychologist, asserted his theory of human behavior that made the role of environmental inﬂuence on individual behavior explicit (see Swartz & Martin, 1997). In the ﬁeld of ecological psychol- ogy, Roger Barker (1963), a student of Lewin’s, also opposed traditional psychological research that allowed “us to be content with a psychology of people to the neglect of a psy- chology of the environment of people” (p. 13). His research program sparked discussions among psychologists on the ex- tent to which immediate settings were the primary determi- nants of behavior patterns (Holahan, Wilcox, Spearly, & Campbell, 1979). Inﬂuential in Barker’s thinking about the continuum along which the varying ﬁelds of psychology fall in their approach to studying behavior was the work of Egon Brunswick (Barker, 1963). The empirical work of Lewin and Barker, in addition to the rarely acknowledged writings of Brunswick, inﬂuenced the future direction of community psychology theory and set the tone for extra-individually oriented psychological study. It is important to note that another parallel contribution to contextual thinking was the emergence of the ﬁeld of environmental psychology at about the same time as community psychology (see Stokols, 1992; Stokols & Altman, 1987).

Another inﬂuence on the “trend” to think contextually was the series of Milbank Conferences held between 1952 and 1961. For example, the 1952 Milbank conference, “Interrela- tions between the Social Environment and Psychiatric Disor- ders,” was very inﬂuential as it provided the historical basis
