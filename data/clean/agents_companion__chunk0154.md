# Challenges in Multi-Agent systems

While multi-agent systems offer numerous advantages, they also face several challenges:

- Task Communication: Today most agent frameworks communicate in messages, not

structured async tasks.

- Task Allocation: Efficiently dividing complex tasks among different agents can be

challenging, and feedback loops are often left up to the developer to implement.

- Coordinating Reasoning: Getting agents to debate and reason together effectively

requires sophisticated coordination mechanisms.

- Managing Context: Keeping track of all the information, tasks, and conversations

between agents can be overwhelming.

- Time and Cost: Multi-agent interactions can be computationally expensive and time-
