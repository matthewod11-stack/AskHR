Many firms have utilised incentives such as higher salary and bonuses to attract and retain

top talents as well as encourage superior job performance (Henagan & Bedeian, 2009).

At the same time, some firms persist with underperforming workers and even refrain

from taking steps to weed out underperforming workers (Mmieh et al., 2011; Shein, 2011;

Taylor, 1998). Although the labour market in many advanced economies such as the US and

Canada are associated with a “pay-for-performance” culture to motivate employees to

achieve optimum outcome (Bloom & Van Reenen, 2011), in many emerging economies

“underperforming employees are typically left in post for several months or even years before

any action is taken to address them” (Bloom & Van Reenen, 2011, p. 1705). Despite decades

of research by international business and strategy scholars on emerging economies, the

existing literature has remained relatively silent as to why firms and managers persist with

underperforming employees even under threat of worsening performance. The largely

unexplored nature of this issue in emerging market context is puzzling given that the

existence of underperforming workers can undermine the contribution levels of fellow

workers (Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2007). More importantly, star performers can become targets

of underperformers, who can engage in acts to undermine their progress and success (see

Henagan & Bedeian, 2009; Fiske, 2011). Our purpose in this study is to examine why firms

persist with underperforming workers in emerging economies. We focus specifically on two

emerging economies in Africa: Ghana and Nigeria, to shed light on the subject. The two

countries are often regarded as the gateways to West Africa.

This paper makes three main contributions to strategic human resources, international

business and strategy research. First, although past studies have examined skill formation

(Mellahi & Collings, 2010), they have failed to offer any robust explanations as to why firms

persist with underperforming employees. In this direction, we integrate the concept of the

paradox of success (Audia et al., 2000), legitimacy literature (Baum & Oliver, 1991;

Suchman, 1995) and “too much invested to quit” perspective (Teger, 1980) to develop a
