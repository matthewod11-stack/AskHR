# Set the Stage for Collaboration

When there’s misalignment between what you expect of an employee

and the work they’re delivering, start by deﬁning what success looks

like and who will be involved in turning around their performance. This

must be a shared goal between you and your employee for them to feel

valued and supported. You can start by stating, “We should have an

honest and open dialogue. My goal is to give you clear feedback and

ensure we are collectively working toward your development.”
