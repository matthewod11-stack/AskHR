Organizations can Ô¨Ånd designing these assessments overwhelming.

We suggest focusing on decision-making and risk-taking, which are

universally important aspects in which merged cultures must align.

organization to determine the highest-scoring dimensions. Those are

strengths of your culture and areas you will want to focus on.
