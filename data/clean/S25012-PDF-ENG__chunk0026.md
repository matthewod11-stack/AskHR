## HBR / Spotlight / The Secret to Successful AI-Driven Process Redesign

now using gen AI to speed up the process of devising new product

formulations. Nestlé, Campbell’s, and PepsiCo are reportedly using a

gen AI platform that helps employees validate new product ideas and

do market research. Coca-Cola is experimenting with a platform that

combines the language capabilities of GPT-4 with DALL-E’s ability

to produce images based on text queries. The platform allows digital

artists to incorporate distinctive branded elements from the company’s

vast archives, giving them a canvas on which they can create original

artwork that will be used in billboard advertising.

Product and component design has long been a mix of art and science—

combining the experience and sensibilities of a designer with the rigor

of prototyping and testing. Across industries, gen AI is accelerating and

transforming numerous elements of the process: creating 3D models

of new ideas, suggesting modiﬁcations to designs, recommending

the materials to be used, optimizing costs, rapidly creating digital

prototypes, and identifying which ideas are most promising.

To what extent can such tools empower employees to improve creative

processes? Consider the case of a single research engineer at NASA.

Using commercially available AI software, Ryan McClelland reinvented the design process for specialized one-oﬀ parts at NASA’s Goddard

Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland. Few organizations make
