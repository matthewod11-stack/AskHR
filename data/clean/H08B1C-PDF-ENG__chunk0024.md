# collaboration.

Instead of: Asking basic questions, such as “How do you see Y evolving

over the next year?” or undermining your own expertise by prefacing

remarks with “This might be a simple question, but…”

Try: Posing the question in a way that highlights your deep

understanding of the subject and contributes value to the discussion.

For example, “Considering trends A and B in Y, how do you see Y

evolving over the next year?”
