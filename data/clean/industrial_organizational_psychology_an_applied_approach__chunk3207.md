# this reorganization from the

beginning. We believed that their insight and input were essential factors for a successful reorganization. Focus groups, involving all levels of employees, were formed a year prior to the implementation of changes. From the focus groups, action steps were developed and explained to everyone so that they could see what still needed to be done. The transition to the reorganization was a slow, difficult, but beneficial process. Even after we were “officially” reorganized, there was fine- tuning of the process.

Team development was a core concept for the reorganization. This process began several years ago with the development of facility teams at seven of our locations. Training was provided to all employees involved regarding their roles and responsibilities on their teams. In addition, we reviewed some effective communication and conflict skills they could use.

There continue to be some

adjustment issues for both administrators and employees regarding these changes. For example, the employees on the facility teams have new responsibility for specific areas of the operation of the facility to ensure the continuity of not only the quality of services but a clean and safe work environment. These teams are also responsible for a portion of their facility’s budget. This

level of responsibility and decision making is new, and we have had to help these employees develop skills in this area. For example, we had to teach them not only how to read a budget but how to manage and understand one. As the agency moves more into the team concept, I will continue to find more creative ways to support the employees and help them make successful changes. I am constantly striving to provide the best services and support to our hardworking, dedicated staff. My goal is to anticipate the changing needs and to be proactive in establishing programs and plans to meet these needs, such as training programs and other methods of employee development. For those students considering a professional career in human resources, I would offer this advice. You need to be an agent of change. Change is inevitable, but scary. The pulse of the agency is often taken through the human resources department, and if you have successfully created an atmosphere where staff feel comfortable in contacting the department to express concerns, you will be able to, as much as possible, calm their fears and model a positive attitude. Keep smiling; it’s all good!

responsibilities, accountability, rewards, and employee selection systems must be reviewed. Data for an analysis are usually collected through observations, review of existing documentation, and employee interviews and surveys consisting of questions that ask for potential recommendations of changes.

Step 2: Determining Executive Direction. Management must then analyze the needs assessment to determine the decisions or actions that will reinforce the culture and to assess the feasibility of certain changes. Using the previous example, if most of the supervisors and managers in an organization are unwilling to share their decision-making authority, a true “empowering” culture cannot be maintained. Consequently, that may be a change that will not be reinforced by the culture. In fact, according to research, it takes the wholehearted support of top manage- ment to implement an empowering philosophy (Schuster et al., ). Addressing possible obstacles to culture change during the transformation process can usu- ally minimize unintended consequences (Gilmore, Shea, & Useem, ).

Step 3: Implementation Considerations. This area addresses how the new culture will be implemented. Will committees or ad hoc groups be set up to carry out changes or will management execute the changes? If the organization’s desired culture includes encouragement of more input by employees, they should be allowed to participate in implementing the empowering organization in order to support the new culture.

Step 4: Training. Culture change means a change of philosophy, and that ultimately means different role expectations. As with any new skill, all organizational mem- bers must be trained in a new philosophy for the new culture to thrive and be long-lasting. This has often been the biggest barrier in organizations that have declared that their members are now empowered to share in decisions. Employ- ees, both management and lower-level, are typically not trained in what that means. As explained later in this chapter, management and employees have dif- ferent interpretations of what empowerment culture means and how to carry it out. Training can reduce such ambiguity and confusion.

Step 5: Evaluation of the New Culture. As with any changes, an evaluation mechanism must be established to review the new culture. Issues such as whether the change actually has occurred or whether old norms and procedures still exist should be addressed. If change has not occurred, additional strategies must be identified to establish and support the new culture.

Now that the ideal culture has been determined, the next step is implement- ing it. This is done by creating dissatisfaction with the existing culture (Van Slyke, ).

Creating Dissatisfaction with Existing Culture Just as creating dissatisfaction with the status quo in general is necessary to promote change, for employees to accept a new culture, the existing culture and status quo must be “upset.” This might mean communicating to employees the future impact of continuing to “do business as usual.” For example, many orga- nizations share data that show technological trends and the financial perfor- mance of the company. If employees see this information as negatively affecting either them or the organization as a whole, this can create the necessary dis- pleasure with the status quo and be the catalyst for developing a new business strategy.

Another way to create dissatisfaction is to distribute attitude surveys that ask people how satisfied they are with the organization’s goal and to suggest ideas for changes. The results of the survey are distributed throughout the organization so that people can see the dissatisfaction level and will begin to buy into a new culture and other organizational changes.

The key at this point is to seek input from employees in the process. A suc- cess ful cultural transformation requires commitment from all levels of the organization. When employees have an opportunity to be an actual part of the change, they are more likely to be committed to it (Van Slyke, ). Once you have started the process of transformation, it is important that it be maintained.

Maintaining the New Culture If the new culture is expected to last, developing new reward systems and selection methods should occur. Rewarding current employees for success- fully participating and cooperating with the new system is imperative (Kotter & Cohen, ). These rewards can include pay for performance in jobs that have increased responsibilities due to the new culture or other changes. But they also go beyond financial rewards, and can include employee recognition and mean- ingful work.

Selection of Employees Future employees should be selected on the basis of how well they epitomize the new culture. For example, if the new culture is one of team decision making, new employees should have not only the ability but the willingness and personality to perform in such an environment. As current employees are replaced by new ones, the new culture can become “frozen” into the desired system selected by the leadership (Lewin, ). On the other hand, continuing to hire employees who prefer a more structured management philosophy and who work better alone will eventually cause the organization to revert to its old culture.

Finally, the socialization process of new employees must reinforce the new culture. Organizational socialization is the process whereby new employees learn the behaviors and attitudes they need to be successful in the organization. It also helps any newcomer to the organization define his role and what is expected of him in his position (Morrison, ). Both informal and formal strategies can help with this process. Informal strategies of socialization include such things as hearing the same stories repeated by several different employees. For example, you have probably listened to people in the workforce talk about getting the best stories by hanging around the water cooler or the copier. Usually stories about some “bad decision” are discussed. New employees who hear stories consistently repeated will get an understanding of the type of culture the organization has. If the discussions are negative, the new employee will begin to believe that the organization is incompetent, mistreats its employees, or is unethical.

There are also formal ways in which organizations can influence the social- ization process. One way is through establishing rituals. Rituals are procedures in which employees participate to become “one of the gang.” Activities such as annual awards, banquets, or staff picnics are rituals that reinforce the impression of a “caring” organization. Another ritual is requiring all new employees to go through a probationary period before being considered a permanent employee.

Finally, symbols that represent certain attitudes of the organization can be used. Symbols are communication tools that convey certain messages to employees. For example, establishment of an on-site wellness center conveys the
