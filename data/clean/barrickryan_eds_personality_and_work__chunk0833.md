# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 297

personality predictors of interindividual differences in latent in- traindividual sales performance. Self-assessed empathy was mod- erately and positively related to initial performance and rate of performance improvement and negatively related to performance decrements (absolute r ranged from .15 to .21), whereas self- assessed persuasiveness was positively related to initial performance, rate of improvement, and performance decrement (r ranged from .10 to .15). Although complex, the ﬁndings are sensible. Empathic salespeople relate to and understand their clients’ needs, whereas use of persuasive tactics ultimately alienates clients. In this study, although the predictor-criterion relationships did not appear to change over time, performance did, demonstrating the impor- tance of incorporating links between predictors and temporal per- formance variability in our models of performance.
