# conversations from our participants:

In the ﬁrst conversation, Julia, playing the part of the business owner,

skillfully used open-ended questions to explore what Mike, the property

manager, cared about. She began by asking, “Which of the three

issues is the most important to you?” This immediately revealed that

Mike cared most about an expedient move-in date. Julia seized this

information and suggested a trade-oﬀ: She’d consider moving in sooner

if he granted her four parking spaces.

Mike, eager to close the deal, oﬀered three parking spaces. Instead of

haggling, Julia pivoted with another question: “What are you willing to

oﬀer for Internet?” This prompted Mike to sweeten the deal by replacing

the old internet cables with ﬁber-optic cable — a win for Julia. However,

Mike stood ﬁrm on oﬀering only three spots. Rather than pushing back

directly, Julia asked another question: “How important is the move-in

date for you?” This led Mike to stress the urgency of the start date,

reminding himself of its priority. Sensing an opportune moment, Julia

made her ﬁnal oﬀer: She’d agree to move in next week in exchange for

the top-tier internet and all four parking spots. This secured the deal,

meeting nearly all her objectives (and fulﬁlling Mike’s needs as well).

In contrast, let’s track a conversation between Alex, playing the role of

business owner, and Oscar, the property manager. Alex started with a

closed question: “I’m looking to move in three months. Do you have

anything available?” This allowed Oscar, the property manager, to give a

short, clipped answer (“yes”) and then take control of the conversation.
