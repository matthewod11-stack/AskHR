# Self-Appraisal

Allowing an employee to evaluate her own behavior and performance is a technique used by only a small percentage of organizations (Atwater, ). In Bismarck, North Dakota, self-ratings account for % of city employees’ evalua- tions (peer ratings account for % and supervisor ratings %).

Research on self-appraisal, however, has found what we might expect to find: Employee self-appraisals tend to suffer from leniency (Beehr, Ivanitskaya, Hansen, Erofeev, & Gudanowski, ) and correlate only moderately (.) with actual performance (Mabe & West, ) and poorly with subordinate (Conway & Huffcutt, ) and management ratings (Beehr et al., ). However, when eval- uations are made with clear rating standards and social comparison information, agreement is increased between self- and supervisor-ratings (Keeping & Sulsky, ; Schrader & Steiner, ). When peer ratings are lower than self-ratings, employees react negatively to, and question the accuracy of, negative feedback (Brett & Atwater, ).

The leniency found in the self-ratings of U.S. workers may not generalize to other countries. Self-ratings of Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese workers suffer from modesty rather than leniency, whereas self-ratings from workers in the United States, mainland China, India, Singapore, and Hong Kong are charac- terized by leniency (Barron & Sackett, ). Further research is still needed to investigate potential cultural differences in self-ratings.

Self-appraisals of performance appear to be most accurate when the self-appraisal will not be used for such administrative purposes as raises or pro- motions (Atwater, ). They are also more accurate when employees under- stand the performance appraisal system (Williams & Levy, ) and when employees believe that an objective record of their performance is available with

which the supervisor can compare the self-appraisal (Farh & Werbel, ). To think more about who should evaluate performance, complete Exercise . in your workbook.
