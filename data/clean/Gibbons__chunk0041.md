### **[The practice of AI-enhanced metacognition]{.underline}**

[Developing metacognitive skill with AI requires specific practices that
go beyond typical ChatGPT interactions:]{.underline}

- [The \'assumption inventory\' exercise: Ask AI to identify every
 > assumption embedded in something you\'ve written --- a strategy
 > document, email, or proposal. You\'ll be stunned by how many
 > invisible beliefs shape your thinking.]{.underline}

- [The \'confidence calibration\' game: Before making predictions or
 > decisions, state your confidence level (0-100%) to an AI system.
 > Have it track your accuracy over time. Research shows that even
 > weather forecasters --- who are actually among the best-calibrated
 > professionals precisely because they get daily feedback on their
 > predictions --- can benefit from systematic tracking. Unlike most
 > of us who tend toward overconfidence, meteorologists have learned
 > through repeated practice to accurately assess their
 > uncertainty.]{.underline}

- [The perspective portfolio: Ask AI to analyze the same situation
 > from multiple viewpoints --- a competitor, regulator, customer,
 > employee, investor. This isn\'t about the AI being right but about
 > using its ability to simulate different frameworks to reveal your
 > own cognitive boundaries.]{.underline}

- [The \"explain It back\" protocol: After explaining something
 > complex to AI, ask it to identify points where your explanation
 > was unclear, contradictory, or incomplete. This surfaces fuzzy
 > thinking that slides by in human conversation where people
 > politely nod along.]{.underline}
