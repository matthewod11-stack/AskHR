# Overcommunicate Overcommunicate your aspirations with your employer, colleagues, and

family openly and honestly. Share a detailed maternity plan with your boss

that lays out what you want to achieve and the clients and areas that you

want to cover. Schedule meetings with your boss before you leave, about a

month before you come back, and monthly afterward to discuss how

things are going. That way, they can step in to offer support when needed.

It’s also important to have continual conversations with your partner at

home. Persistently check on how your balance of work and home life is

going. In my house, this changes every week. We constantly talk — or

frantically text in the middle of the day — about who will pick up our

oldest from daycare and who can travel on which dates.

Course Correct Then, be prepared to adjust. It’s impossible to know what it’s like to juggle

your family and your career until you’re in the thick of it. So be open to

reassessing your goals and course correct as required.

You may ﬁnd that you can do more than you expected. When I ﬁrst came

back from maternity leave, I was convinced that I wouldn’t be able to

commit to multiple client-facing roles. But once I set boundaries and

became better at delegating, I found I had more time in my day than

anticipated and could gradually take on more.
