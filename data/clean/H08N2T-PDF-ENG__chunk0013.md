Ideally, your non-negotiables should boil down to just one or two

factors, which may be best understood when you consider them “in

reverse.” For example, you may wish to ask yourself whether you would

ever work in a job that: is extremely stressful/high-pressure, has a

questionable moral/ethical impact on society, is seen negatively by

others (including those you care about), is extremely boring, is at odds

with your personal beliefs/values, is extremely unpredictable/unstable,

lacks a positive social/interpersonal component, doesn’t pay well, etc.
