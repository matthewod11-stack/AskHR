# 74 PERSONALITY AND WORK

on performance depending on the degree of cooperative or com- petitive demands at work.

The Barrick et al. (2002) study is also suggestive about the im- portance of accounting for the cooperative and competitive de- mands salient in the situation. In this study, the job (telemarketing) was characterized as one high in competitive demands (with high sales pressure and contact with the customer limited to one brief telephone interaction), but low in cooperative demands (the sales representative works alone and is not dependent on others for per- formance). Given these situational factors, Barrick et al. expected Status Striving, but not Communion Striving, to be a relevant me- diator of the personality-performance relationship. As expected, they found that Status Striving was related to performance (r = .36) and Communion Striving was not (r = âˆ’.10). More important, as predicted by the model in Figure 3.1, the major portion of the re- lationship between Extraversion and job performance was indirect through Status Striving (approximately 76 percent of the effect is mediated by Status Striving). Although Agreeableness was related to Communion Striving, neither Agreeableness nor Communion Striving was related to success in this sales job.

These results have important implications for the model. In essence, they show that relevant personality traits were related to job success through motivational mediators. Although this study was not able to contrast multiple situations (it did not include data from multiple jobs that differed in cooperative or competitive so- cial demands), it did support the linkage expected for jobs with high competitive demands.

We realize that the model is silent regarding the effect that co- operative demands may have on competitive demands, and vice versa. In fact, Figure 3.1 implies that these situational demands are relatively independent. This is not our intent. Given our limited knowledge about the nature of these relationships, particularly at work, we believe that future research should strive to clarify the re- lationship among these competing demands (the need for team- work, yet the need to be individually recognized and rewarded). For the time being, we anticipate that researchers will examine the relations among these variables in jobs that are clearly high in co- operative demands or competitive demands.
