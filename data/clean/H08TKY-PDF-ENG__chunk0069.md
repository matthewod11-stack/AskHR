## products and services for their most demanding (and usually most

proﬁtable) customers, they exceed the needs of some segments and

ignore the needs of others. Entrants that prove disruptive begin

by successfully targeting those overlooked segments. They gain a

foothold by oﬀering a product that is inferior to those of incumbents’

products—and can’t meet the needs of incumbents’ mainstay customers

—but that delivers the functionality needed by customers in the

overlooked segments, frequently at a lower price. Incumbents, chasing

higher proﬁtability in more-demanding segments, tend not to respond

vigorously. Entrants then move upmarket, improving their products so

that they can deliver the performance that incumbents’ mainstream

customers require while preserving the advantages that drove their

early success. When mainstream customers start adopting the entrants’

oﬀerings in volume, disruption has occurred.
