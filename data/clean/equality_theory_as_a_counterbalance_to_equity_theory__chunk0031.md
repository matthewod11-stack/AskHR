# Perquisites

While they play a functional role relative to attracting and rewarding talent, perquisites, by deﬁnition, imply a form of differential, equity-based allotment (‘‘perquisite: a thing regarded as a special right or privilege enjoyed as a result of one’s position’’, Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictio- nary 2005). But some corporations now eliminate differ- ential perquisites, instead explicitly claiming to distribute them based on an equality rule (Fisher 2000; Hornstein 2002; Lawler 2006; Reddy 2004). For example, Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream, its egalitarian human resource practices, explicitly advertises itself as a perkless company. All beneﬁt packages are equivalent; there are no insurance policies, country club differential medical memberships, homes, cars, tax-deferred retirement plans, stock options, low interest loans, or bonus plans (Rosen 1991). Similarly, employees of Nucor Steel receive equivalent life insurance, group hospitalization, and vaca- tion; the ﬁrm maintains no company cars or airplanes, hunting or ﬁshing lodges, everyone travels economy class (Iverson 1995). At a company studied by Martin (1992), claims of egalitarianism were validated in employees’ eyes because ‘‘perks’’ were distributed not by status, but according to job-related needs—better cars to sales people, better computer monitors to design people, and so on.
