Abstract This conceptual paper revisits the concept of equality as a base of distributive justice and contends that it is underspeciﬁed, both theoretically and in terms of its ethical and pragmatic application to human resource management (HRM) within organizations. Prior organiza- tional literature focuses primarily upon distributive equal- ity of remunerative outcomes within small groups and implicitly employs an equity-based conception of inputs to deﬁne equality. In contrast, through exposition of the philosophical roots of equality principles, we reconceptu- alize inputs as de facto equal and consider the systemic application of distributive equality in the form of status leveling practices. Ethical ramiﬁcations of distributive equality so viewed are explored. We conclude by arguing that, to implicitly insert a stronger ethics focus into the study and practice of HRM, perhaps there should be ‘‘equality theory’’ competing with equity theory for rec- ognition in managerial and scholarly discourse.
