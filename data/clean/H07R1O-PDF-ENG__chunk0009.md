In fact, the CEO’s role demands high levels of emotional labor, even if

many observers fail to appreciate it. CEOs are required to project public

conﬁdence even when they may have personal doubts. They must own the consequences of making diﬃcult decisions that inevitably make

some constituencies unhappy. They must bear the responsibility for

bad outcomes, even if others are responsible for these consequences.

They must absorb the disappointments people feel — from how they

were treated to how the organization is performing — because CEOs

personify the organization. They must be empathetic and comforting

when others are emotionally distraught. They must prioritize the

organization’s needs above their personal needs. They must be willing

to endure public scrutiny that may be exhausting and, at times, hurtful.

And they must do all this while being authentic, which requires opening

up in a manner that feels vulnerable.

Yet, one of the unwritten rules of the CEO role is that it’s unacceptable

to talk about the emotional toll the job takes. When a CEO breaches this

norm, the consequences come quickly. In May of 2010, with an oil well

run by BP spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico, BP CEO Tony Hayward

gave a TV interview in which he said: “There’s no one who wants

this thing over more than I do. I’d like my life back.” The comment

caused widespread criticism because Hayward seemed to be asking for

sympathy amid a tragedy that killed 11 oil workers and caused extensive

damage to the Gulf ecosystem. A few weeks later, on a rare day oﬀ,

Hayward was photographed sailing in a yacht race with his son, a move

that drew criticism from the White House. Five weeks later, Hayward

was replaced as CEO.
