Here’s the thing: No one is “naturally” good at giving feedback.It’s a skill that’s learned over time with guidance and practice. Butas a new manager, it’s essential that you do learn it — and not justin the context of delivering yearly performance reviews. In fact,many leading companies have been

dropping annual

performance ratings in favor of more immediate and ongoingconversations. More than ever, real-time critiques are part of dailylife for managers.Fortunately, there are steps you can take to become better atproviding consistent performance feedback. It starts withbecoming aware of the mistakes you may be making and learningwhat to do to avoid those pitfalls.

A manager who gives feedback without first establishing trust islike a director who fails to set the scene before their actors takethe stage. In the absence of trust, your direct reports will have aharder time hearing, accepting, and acting on your feedback.Think about it in the context of receiving feedback from your ownboss. If they seem indifferent to your career goals, providescattered feedback without direction, and try to control yourevery move, are you going to readily accept and act on thefeedback they provide? What about if instead, they take the timeto understand you, share feedback in the context of youraspirations, and give you space to grow and learn?
