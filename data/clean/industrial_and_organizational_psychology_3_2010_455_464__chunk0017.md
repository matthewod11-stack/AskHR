as a lack of external validity. Each of these issues is discussed in more detail below.

External validity. We agree with portions the critiques expressed by the com- of mentators, but we maintain that a more nuanced discussion on external validity is needed. JDM research would certainly gain by diversifying its samples and set- tings (and indeed its stimuli and criteria; Hayes & Wooldridge, 2010). For example, we believe that JDM would beneﬁt a great deal—both per se and in terms of its exportability to other ﬁelds such as IOOB—from the development of a com- prehensive and well-accepted taxonomy of judgment and decision-making tasks (see also Hayes & Wooldridge, 2010). More- over, in a subsequent section of this article, we discuss alternatives to, and variations on, traditional laboratory experiments.

These agreements notwithstanding, we reiterate that it is the theory (not the sample or setting) that does or does not generalize (Highhouse, 2009; Highhouse & Gillespie, 2009) and that any sample and setting to which the theory is expected to generalize is ‘‘fair game’’ for research. Many JDM theories are at least intended to apply to all human beings across a variety of contexts (as Staw, 2010, notes). In other words, these theories are intended to generalize to both laboratory and ﬁeld settings and to both basic research and applied issues. In our view, therefore, it would therefore be shortsighted to write JDM research off solely because of its settings and samples.

We do agree that, if researchers are inter- ested in the study of decisions in workplace settings, it would be a good idea to assess whether the predictions from these theories really do apply equally to all employ- ees in all work settings. Given that JDM researchers have unfortunately not thus far been particularly interested in work- place decision making, IOOB researchers could pick up the research baton. Rather than dismissing the JDM theories out of hand because of the samples and set- tings used by JDM researchers, such an approach would emphasize the potential
