# terms of their current employment.

While 52% of hiring managers thought their most recent hire was

fully informed of the terms of their employment and 65% thought

they had fully consented to these terms, only 20% of employees felt

fully informed of the terms of their employment and only 39% felt

that they had fully consented to them. Further, employees who felt

uninformed at the outset of their roles were more likely to disengage,

perceive their workplace as unfair, and develop strained relationships

with supervisors. They were also more likely to consider quitting.
