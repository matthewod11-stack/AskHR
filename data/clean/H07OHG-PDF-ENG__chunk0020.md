## into “Learning Experience Platforms” (LXP), with features like skills

assessments, Netﬂix-style recommendations about what to learn next,

and internal social networking. LXPs “make learning relevant for

individuals, not just managing training programs,” according Todd

Tauber senior vice president of strategy at Degreed, one of the leading

providers in this space. Industry analyst Josh Bersin estimates the

market for LXPs is $500m, up from $200m in 2018.

Customers report that the model is working. Chris Harry is the chief learning oﬃcer of TEK Systems, a staﬃng ﬁrm that’s been using

Degreed. “Since moving our various employee development programs

onto Degreed, we’ve seen our highest-ever engagement and satisfaction

rates,” he said. According to Harry, 96% of TEK employees have created

an account in Degreed, and the company consistently sees 40 to 50%

of them actively using the platform each month, which he says is “far

higher than anything we’ve seen before.”

Results like these require real investment beyond simply buying the

technology. For example, another Degreed customer, Ericsson, said

it hired internal champions and developed an extensive internal

marketing campaign to roll out its program.
