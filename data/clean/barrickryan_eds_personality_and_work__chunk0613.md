# 202 PERSONALITY AND WORK

traits, particularly Agreeableness. These traits lead to both higher individual-level performance and a direct inﬂuence on team-level characteristics. One way of viewing these characteristics is to think of teams in trait terms. Adapting the individual-level framework of the FFM to the team level of analysis suggests that our under- standing can advance as we see teams in terms of their Agreeable- ness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience. These team-level effects can then be as- sessed in terms of their inﬂuence on and interaction with other team-level factors.

Personality does appear to be an important construct in teams, but it can be understood only from a multilevel perspective. This perspective is required because teams represent a group-level phe- nomenon that interacts with the individual-level perspective preva- lent in most personality research. Future research and practice will advance as researchers and practitioners take into account these cross-level relationships and seek understanding across both indi- vidual and group levels of analysis. Indeed, this multilevel per- spective appears to be one of the most critical areas for future research in the ﬁeld of personality.
