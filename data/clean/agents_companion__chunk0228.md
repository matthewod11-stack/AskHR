# Subcontracts

Although not part of the contract definition and specification directly, the ability to

decompose a task into subtasks by generating subcontracts is a core concept that will be

used to power the contractorsâ€™ engine.

When a task is considered too complex to be tackled directly, contractors can decide to

decompose the task into smaller and easier tasks, which will be added to the execution

queue for solving. This is made possible only through the contract formalization described

above, which makes it possible for the contractors to generate, process and manipulate
