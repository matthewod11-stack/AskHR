# Further Reﬁning Analytical Methods

Answering (at least to some degree) the questions above will clarify and specify the stage models of job performance. Nonetheless, conﬁrmatory cross-sectional tests cannot conclusively prove any such longitudinal model, and longitudinal research is inevitably required to fully understand job performance within the context of time. The question remains as to how best to analyze these variables with a longitudinal design. HLM and LGCM are both potentially fruitful analytical techniques, but we still need guidance as to how these methods should be applied speciﬁcally to the issue of modeling job performance.

This is where Learning Theory can play an important role. A better understanding of the speciﬁc shape of the individual job performance learning curves will provide guidance into the structure of both LGCM and
