Again, five demographic variables were entered first for explaining and Religion. Intent Collectively, the Intent to Stay variance, R2 ¼ 0.11, F(5, 114) ¼ 2.92, p < .05. Two varia- bles, Gender and Age, were each significant: Gender, b ¼(cid:2)0.27, t(118) ¼ (cid:2)2.59, p < .01, such that women had a higher intent to stay; and Age, b ¼ .20, t(118) ¼ 4.23, p < .01 such that older employees had a higher two Organization variables were added, Intent Organization Tenure and Position Level/Role. Collectively, these variables explained a non-significant additional proportion of the Intent to Stay variance, R2 ¼ 0.03, and the overall F(7, 112) ¼ 2.64, p < .05. One vari- able, Position Level/Role was significant, b¼0.27, t(118) ¼ 2.37, p < .05, such that non-management respondents had a higher intent to stay. in the third step, all four OB scales were entered separately. Finally, the Collectively these variables explained a significant proportion of Intent to Stay variance, R2 ¼ 0.21, with an overall F(11, 108) ¼ 5.19, p < .01. Only Acceptance had a significant positive impact on Intent to Stay, b ¼0.25, t(118) ¼ 2.57, p < .01. Overall, the model explained 35% of the variance in Intent to Stay, and 28% when adjusted for shrinkage. Collectively, these regression results provide partial support for RQ3 – OB scales will contribute to explaining productivity and intent to stay beyond controlled for demographic and organization variables.
