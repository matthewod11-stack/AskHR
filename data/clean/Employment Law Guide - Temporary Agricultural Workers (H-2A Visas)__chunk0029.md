# certiﬁcation program.

The H-2A temporary agricultural program establishes a means for agricultural employers who anticipate a shortage of domestic workers to

bring nonimmigrant foreign workers to the U.S. to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature. Before the U.S.

Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) can approve an employer's petition for such workers, the employer must ﬁle an application with

the Department stating that there are not suﬃcient workers who are able, willing, qualiﬁed, and available, and that the employment of aliens

will not adversely aﬀect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. The statute and Departmental regulations provide for numerous worker protections and employer requirements with respect to wages and working conditions. The Department's Wage

and Hour Division has responsibility for enforcing provisions of worker contracts.

Any employer who has been certiﬁed for a speciﬁc number of H-2A jobs must have initially attempted to ﬁnd U.S. workers to ﬁll these slots.

Even after H-2A workers are recruited employers must continue to engage in "positive recruitment" of U.S. workers.
