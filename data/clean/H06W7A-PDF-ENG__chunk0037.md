following three steps. First, when evaluating a set of options specifically

denote time on your agenda to challenge the status quo. Discuss how

the solutions that have been used before might not solve the current

why even when disagreeing about the how. These tactics will help teams

keep fresh ideas alive to fuel organizational creativity and innovation.
