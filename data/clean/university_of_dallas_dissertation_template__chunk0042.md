reciprocal relationship. Employees who believe managers are trustworthy feel respected and like

a part of the leader’s core group. Employees who trust others anticipate that others will act

similarly (Korsgaard et al., 2015). Trust is essential to maintaining a positive relationship

between leaders and their employees (Colquitt & Rodell, 2011; Whitener et al., 1998). (cid:32)

Suppose an employee believes top management is incompetent. In that case, this attitude

likely raises questions about their ability to set organizational direction (Mayer & Davis, 1999),

thus reducing the employee’s confidence in top management’s vision (Colquitt & Salam, 2009).

A negative impression of senior management’s integrity creates a perceived gap between senior

management’s words and actions. This gap appears to violate the principles and values accepted

by the employee (Knoll & Gill, 2011; Simons, 2002). When employees feel that senior

management does not demonstrate trustworthiness, they face senior management’s inability to

lead the company, including operating against their morals and not assisting them (Mölders et

al., 2019). According to Frijda (1988), an increase in negative emotions may be a common

reaction to these perceptions. Research has previously demonstrated how trust and emotions

interact (C. C. Chen et al., 2011; Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005; G. R. Jones & George, 1998;

Tomlinson & Mayer, 2009; M. Williams, 2007). According to Lindebaum and Gabriel (2016),

unethical senior management can anger and disgust people when managers violate moral

standards and doubt top management’s morality (Smith-Crowe & Warren, 2014). Similarly,

negative emotions like anger and sadness may surface when employees believe they are at the

mercy of non-benevolent senior management (C. C. Chen et al., 2011). A lack of trustworthiness

among top management may cause unfavorable employee reactions (Mölders et al., 2019).(cid:32)
