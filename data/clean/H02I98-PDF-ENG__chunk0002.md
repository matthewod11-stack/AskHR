have a tough time getting assignments again after they return. Both

scenarios are easily avoided with a three-meeting protocol.

The ﬁrst meeting occurs shortly after the announcement is made. The

employee’s supervisor celebrates and reassures: “Congratulations! It’s

an exciting time, and you need not hesitate to take your full leave. We will

develop a transition plan together.”

With biological children, there are months ahead to talk. If your leave-

taker is an adoptive parent whose child could arrive at home with less

notice, the next two meetings will be on an accelerated schedule.

The second meeting typically occurs three months before the leave is

scheduled to begin. “Come with a list of all the projects you are working

on and who you think might be suitable to transition them to when you go

on leave. If no one comes to mind, don’t worry. We can ﬁgure someone out

or hire extra help. Your list will only be a beginning.” After this meeting,

the supervisor should develop a transition plan, talking with the people

who will be picking up the leave-taker’s work or hiring temporary help if

need be.

The third meeting occurs as the due or adoption date approaches. In it,

ﬁnal tweaks are made to the plan; afterwards, transitions begin. At this

time, the supervisor should ask for the leave-takers’ current thoughts

about post-leave. Is he or she thinking about returning on a part-time or

ﬂex schedule? (It’s important for legal reasons that the same question be

asked of everyone, male or female.) This doesn’t need to be a binding

decision—it’s just a chance for a supervisor to get an initial heads up.
