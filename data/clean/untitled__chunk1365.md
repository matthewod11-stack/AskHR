# Social Heavens and the New Century

directed their science of social phenomena toward the aims of historical and phenomenological understanding, notably toward hermeneutics and psychoanalysis (Bauman, 1978; Steele, 1982).

By contrast, purchased on a stand of positivist science and optimistic reformism, American intellectuals confronted the apparent paradox of championing the rationality of progres- sive democratic society while at the same time asserting the irrationality of human action (see Soffer, 1980). These scien- tists consequently faced an associated paradox of deploying rational scientiﬁc procedures to assay the irrationality of human conduct. Despite these paradoxes, or maybe because of them, American social psychologists engineered their examinations of the microdynamics of social thought and action by simultaneously inventing, discovering, and repro- ducing social life in methodically regulated research settings. The paradoxes were overwritten by a model of reality con- sisting of three assertions: the unquestionable veracity of the scientiﬁc (experimental) method, the fundamental lawfulness of human nature, and the essential psychological base of human social life.

The early psychological perspectives on the social dynam- ics of human nature were neither universally nor consistently tied to these three premises about human nature, and for that reason many of these bold pilot ventures are omitted from conventional textbook histories of psychology’s social psy- chology. Given that the individual was a central analytic category in their discipline, psychologists were drawn toward understanding the nature of the social in terms of its funda- mental relations to the individual. By the last decade of the nineteenth century they began to generate a variety of theoret- ical perspectives, alternatively deﬁning the social dimensions of the individual as mental functions, consciousness, evolu- tionary products (or by-products), human faculties, or histori- cally emergent properties. A sampling of these psychological conceptions advanced around the turn of the century illus- tratestheremarkablevarietiesofintellectualoptionsavailable for developing a psychological social psychology.
