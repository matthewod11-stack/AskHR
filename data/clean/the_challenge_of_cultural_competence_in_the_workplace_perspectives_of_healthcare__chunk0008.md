While the uptake of cross-cultural education models has been widespread across health care systems, evidence for the models’ ability to reduce cross-cultural health care dis- parities has been slim. There has been some confirmation of temporary improvements in practitioner attitudes and patient experiences post model implementation (usually in the form of a workshop), however the impact on patient treatment outcomes has been largely negligible [16–18]. While there are possible associated explanations for these findings (e.g., model implementation integrity, methodo- logical rigor of validation studies, broader organizational factors) is it uncertain as to why current cross-cultural edu- cation strategies have not had stronger effects. In fact, there is evidence indicating that certain delivery styles (e.g., coer- cive, shame-and-blame) of cross-cultural education may have unintended contrary outcomes for participating staff [8, 19]. Other literature has offered some speculation as to why such trainings and associated initiatives may fall short in achieving anticipated outcomes in health care settings [20–23]. Shepherd [9] points to the impracticality of retain- ing and then utilizing ‘quickly-learned’ cultural knowledges, customs and interaction styles beyond cross-cultural work- shops. The potential for essentializing and/or homogenizing cultural groups leading to stereotypical pre-conceptions has also been referred to [22, 24–26]. Moreover, numerous fac- tors may impact a cross-cultural clinical encounter beyond cultural differences (e.g., personality, temperament, cogni- tive ability, level of education, socio-economic status, men- tal health, universally poor service delivery). It is clear that further research efforts are required to explore how cross- cultural education is typically delivered, received and imple- mented in various health care settings.

One way to acquire this information is to ascertain the views and experiences of health care professionals themselves. Cross-cultural training workshops are often validated by health care professionals via pre-post inter- vention surveys. However, the insights and perceptions of health care professionals are infrequently sought when attempting to develop, define or refine effective cross-cultural practice. Few studies globally, have ex- plored the perceptions of professionals on cross-cul- tural education initiatives in health care. A number of studies from Australia (samples < n = 20) explored the barriers to effective cross-cultural communication as identified by health workers and the importance they afforded to cultural competence [27–30]. Similar stud- ies were conducted with small samples of nurses in Scotland [31] and Ireland [32]. In North America, a study from Canada assessed attitudes towards cultural competence for 170 registered nurses [33] and a study from USA explored how 31 public health nurses gauged their own levels of cultural competence and experi- ences of culturally competent care [34]. The opinions of both health care providers and medical staff on some
