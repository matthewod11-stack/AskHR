# and access of health care

to culturally

Cross-cultural education training for health care profes- sionals is now commonplace and in some settings, man- dated [8, 9]. Its principles are often embedded within the strategic plans of health organizations, and human resource departments will often oversee the advancement of such initiatives. Participating health care systems usually employ one, or a combination, of several popular cross-cultural models that have emerged over the past four decades. These include, but are not limited to, cultural awareness, cultural competence, cultural safety, cultural humility and cultural intelligence. There are also multiple off-shoots in- cluding anti-racism training and diversity training. The cross-cultural models overlap considerably though they have differing emphases. Cultural awareness focuses on learning about the norms and customs of multi-cultural groups [10]. Cultural safety is concerned with protecting the culture of vulnerable groups by identifying biases and power imbalances within organizational structures [11]. Cultural humility promotes openness and non-judgement while allowing the client to determine how their culture impacts their experiential reality and by extension, the clinical encounter [12]. Cultural intelligence focuses on an individual’s capacity to first recognize and then success- fully function in various cultural environments foreign to their own [13]. And cultural competence (though often used generically) is an institutional framework that ex- pands an organization’s internal and external capacity to support and implement protocols that improve worker at- titudes, cross-cultural communication, staff diversity, and ongoing relationships with multi-cultural communities and stakeholders [14]. The adoption of these models, or aspects of the models, are believed to ultimately reduce the obstacles that still contribute to the poor health care experiences and unmet health needs of particular cultural minority groups [15].
