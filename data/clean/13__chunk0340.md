# MICHAEL C. STURMAN

In all, this body of research resulted in strong, arguably undeniable, support of a lack of performance consistency. Empirically reviewing the research, Sturman et al. (2005) attempted to partial out unreliability from stability, and thus present information on the extent to which performance truly is dynamic. The results of their study showed that while there is evi- dence of testâ€“retest unreliability (and other measurement error) causing some of the observed inconsistency in job performance ratings over time, job performance ratings (both job performance(behaviors) and job performan- ce(results)) are dynamic. While there remains debate in the literature as to the pervasiveness and extent of performance changes (e.g., Austin et al., 1989; Barrett & Alexander, 1989; Barrett et al., 1985), and there does appear to be at least some portion of job performance that is stable over time (Hanges et al., 1990; Sturman et al., 2005), there is now abundant research and general consensus that job performance does change over time (Deadrick & Madigan, 1990; Deadrick, Bennett, & Russell, 1997; Henry & Hulin, 1987; Hofmann, Jacobs, & Baratta, 1993; Hofmann, Jacobs, & Gerras, 1992; Hulin et al., 1990; Ployhart & Hakel, 1998; Sturman & Trevor, 2001; Sturman et al., 2005). Still in question, though, are the implications of performance dynamism and the causes and correlates of job performance changes over time.
