management remains unclear. A recent paper concluded that there is “a disturbing lack of

clarity regarding the definition, scope and overall goals of talent management” (Lewis

and Heckman, 2006: 139), a view which also prevails in the practitioner literature. In this

regard, a UK survey found that 51 per cent of HR professionals surveyed undertook

management literature is exacerbated by the fact that, in addition to ambiguities around

the definition of the concept, there has also been an alarming lack of theoretical

development in the area (for notable exceptions see Boudreau and Ramstad, 2005; 2007;
