# 486 Ethnic Minorities

They rule out independent volition and choice as important contributors to behavior. It should be noted, however, that the humanistic view is seen as complementing and extending rather than replacing mechanistic frameworks. For the hu- manist, the latter views are seen as incomplete as ways of accounting for human experience. This is because the exercise of choice and the conceptions guiding these choices are often not always apparent from the external observer’s view of a given set of behaviors.

This is illustrated in a passage from the opening pages of Ellison’s important American novel, Invisible Man (1952). A family is gathered around the deathbed of an old southern Black man. In his dying words to his son the man says, “I want you to overcome ’em with yeses, undermine ’em with grins, agree ’em to death and destruction.” The family was stunned. “They thought the old man had gone out of his mind. He had been the meekest of men” (pp. 19–20, italics added). Obviously this man was advocating, among other things, lulling his white bosses into complacency in the hope that their system would deteriorate and blacks would then be free of it. His underlying intent—an intent which kept him going—was hostile, quite at variance with his superﬁcially obsequious manner. In addition, referring back to our earlier

discussion of meaning, this old man had taken a “dialectic” perspective on his situation throughout his life without any- one being quite aware of it, and he was now advocating such a view explicitly to his family. That is to say, recognizing fully the nature of his oppressive circumstances, this old man had acted one way, but at the same time he had quite the op- posite mental perspective on the racial situation. This was his way of sustaining his human qualities “despite and in rejec- tion of the obstacles and meannesses” that had been imposed upon him.And he was urgently trying to pass that strategy on to his family as a part of his legacy.

Thus, we cannot understand this man’s behavior unless we take an “introspective” or “ﬁrst-person” view. And so it is with African Americans: If we are to have “true to life” psy- chological descriptions, in addition to our more “objective” descriptions, we must learn to conceptualize and align our- selves with the inner worlds—the subjectivity—of people of color if our theory and practice is to be relevant to their expe- rience. This is the opportunity that the “fresh winds” in psy- chology have brought us—the possibility of including into our discipline a more proactive conception of the human being that will contribute to the understanding and advance- ment of people in all of their plurality.
