for reporting concerns about unkind behaviors, especially in high-

## pressure, fast-paced, or customer-facing environments.

Managers at all levels should set the tone—by acting as a role model

and by what they do and don’t allow. Organizations can support them

by teaching them how to reinforce expectations, including what to do

when people fall short.

Some organizations can serve as models. One is the U.S. Department

of Veterans Aﬀairs, where civility training is part of leadership

development and includes learning to manage and respond to feedback

loops about unprofessional conduct in real time. Another is Ritz-

Carlton, the luxury hotel and resort chain. During induction training,

new employees are given a “Credo Card” with a list of expectations,

including greeting every guest warmly by name and showing genuine

respect and appreciation for colleagues. These are further reinforced

in daily team meetings, and when people do a good job, it is explicitly

recognized.

Here are some examples of kindness norms that can be embedded into

## onboarding, performance reviews, leadership training, and governance

# structures:

- Employees and customers will always be addressed by name, and

eﬀorts will be taken to pronounce them correctly.

- When we are in a conversation, we will actively listen and maintain our

full presence (e.g., phones are put away, eye contact is maintained).

- Gratitude for others will be expressed, and we will acknowledge the

# contributions of those around us.

- Feedback—positive or corrective—is given regularly and promptly,

consistently delivered with respect, honesty, and care for dignity and

# growth.

## HBR / Digital Article / Why Kindness Isn’t a Nice to Have

- If someone acts unkindly, it gets called out in real time, and that

person is held accountable for that behavior. If an individual’s

behavior puts others at risk of physical or emotional harm, it is taken

seriously and followed up through formal reporting channels.

When kindness is framed in this way, it becomes part of the shared

legend of what it means to work in a place: what it means to be a good

## colleague, professional, and manager or leader.

- 3. Measure kindness.

Most organizations that take something seriously measure it. The same

should apply to kindness. It should be measured in terms of observable

## behaviors and team experiences and not in vague or subjective terms.

While no perfect kindness metric currently exists, many organizations

already measure distinctly related dynamics such as psychological

safety, inclusion, civility, and trust. Others dig into the root causes

## of turnover, absenteeism, engagement, and productivity, which can

include the presence or absence of kindness at work.

Organizations don’t need to reinvent the wheel to measure relational

behaviors. Existing surveys can be adapted. Items not labelled

speciﬁcally as kindness can measure the conditions that help or hinder

# kindness in everyday work.

This HBR article outlines survey items used for measuring social capital

## by Press Ganey, a healthcare performance-improvement company

that specializes in measuring and improving patient, employee, and

consumer experiences. These include healthcare employees’ feelings

about being respected and involved, their sense of equity and

belonging, and perceptions of safety culture. These are items that reﬂect

environments where kindness is present. Survey items—rated on a scale
