How do you staff for that?

We need a lot of builders—people who like to invent, who like to dissect

the customer experience and ﬁgure out what’s wrong with it, even if it’s

pretty good, and then rebuild it. And we need owners—people who ask,

“What would I do if it were my money? What would I do if I owned all

the resources?” In other words, people who feel accountable.

How do you think about pace?

Speed disproportionately matters in every business at every time. I used

to speak with a lot of CEOs who would say, “We’re big. We have security

issues. We have compliance issues. We just can’t move fast.” I think

speed is a leadership decision. You can decide you want to move fast,

but you have to ﬁgure out what’s slowing you down and knock all those

barriers out. Then you’ve got to get the whole organization aligned on

moving really fast, even if you make mistakes along the way.

That’s a classic challenge: How do you move quickly in a big organization with so many layers of management?

You need to really try to root out bureaucracy. As you get bigger,

you have a lot of managers—well-intended people—who keep layering
