## Like return-to-work mandates, blanket policies for employee mental

health rarely succeed and aren’t realistic given the varied ways we work

today. Jim Mortensen, president of R3 Continuum, a leading workplace

behavioral health provider, says: “Just as a general practitioner can’t

handle every physical medical issue that an individual has, a single

behavioral health solution won’t address all the problems that an

employee base has. You have to both recognize the diversity of issues

within a company and also understand the speciﬁc stressors of that

organization, because they do diﬀer. If you aren’t tailoring the solutions

to the problems that people are experiencing, you won’t get the results

you need.”
