Cross-industry opportunities. Workers often don’t realize they can do

a very similar job in a very diﬀerent industry. As industries grow and

shrink, it’s important to keep that possibility in mind and get creative

about seeking opportunities. In some cases it may even be worth trading

a higher salary for a role in a growth sector. Just as you do when

jumping to a new occupation, when you move to a new industry you

take relevant skills with you—and increase your experience capital.
