factors associated with retention, turnover, burnout, and job satisfaction in behavior technicians.

Interobserver agreement (IOA) data were collected for study inclusion. The authors independently followed the pro- cedures discussed previously for study inclusion. Percentage of agreement was calculated by dividing the total number of agreements by the total number of agreements plus disagree- ments and multiplying by 100 (Kazdin 1982). IOA for study inclusion was 96.9% (i.e., the authors disagreed on one arti- cle). The disagreement was discussed and resolved. Procedures were also in place to verify the data collected from the included studies. One author extracted data from the stud- ies (i.e., sample size, setting, methods, dependent variables and measures, independent variables found to be significant, independent variables found to be insignificant). The second author reviewed and verified the extracted data. Any disagree- ments between the authors were resolved via discussion.
