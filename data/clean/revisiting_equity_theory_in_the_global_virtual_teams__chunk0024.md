# Equity ratio = O(PE)/I(SE)

In our study, we use the average PE as a proxy of individual output “O”. PE is the main individual performance indicator; on average, it accounts for 30% of students’ total grades and instructors use it to evaluate students’ contribution so that it represents the main individual output. Grades play a

similar role as compensation for workers, and in the context of online teamwork, PE i s the only available individual measure of individual output and the most widely adopted (Tavoletti et al., 2019, 2023). In contrast, SE is considered the input “I” because SE is the self-evaluated individual contribution. PE and SE data were collected at the end of the project and measured using a five- fort, point Likert scale along the following dimensions: friendliness, communication, role, ef English language skills, innovation, leadership, tech skills, work ethic and percentage of w ork done. The literature comparing SE and PE in GVTs is vast and consolidated (Taras et a l., 2021; Davaei et al., 2022).

Sensitivity to equity groups. There are different ways of measuring individual diffe rences from the perspective of how people view situations of inequity. This includes the equity sensitivity instrument (Huseman et al., 1985, 1987); the equity preference questionnaire (Sauley and Bedeian, 2000); and the most recent multidimensional view of the equity sensitivity construct (Davison and Bing, 2008). Although support for the validity of all three approaches has been reported (Taylor et al., 2009), they all appear to display some difficulty in their respective operationalization in GVTs (Foote and Harmon, 2006). Due to this, we concluded that it would be optimal not to use any of the aforementioned scales.

Instead, following ET extant theory, we created three equity groups, comparing the

cally, the individual equity ratio to the teams’ mean equity ratio (Huseman et al., 1987). Specifi n, the Equity Sensitives are the individuals whose O/I ratios are equal to the team media Benevolents are the ones with O/I ratios lower than the team median and the Entitles have larger O/I ratios than their team median. The Sensitives were challenging to define am ong these three groups because all the O/I ratios are calculated scores (O/I = PE/SE). Thus, it would end up with very few students with O/I ratios exactly equal to the team medium. Therefore, we took a “loose match” approach and rounded the difference score between students’ O/I ratios and te am median to one decimal place. So then an individual would belong to the Sensitive group if such a difference score for them is approximately equal to 0. Similarly, individuals are considered Bene volents if the difference between students’ O/I ratios and team median is below 0 and Entitleds if the difference is above 0.

The distribution of the three equity groups is as follows and offers an almost equal

distribution into the three groups as it is reasonable for a concept of equity that is devel comparison to other individuals in the GVT Table 1.

Job Satisfaction was measured at the end of the project, using one survey item: “In general, how HAPPY are you with the tasks you had to complete?” with a five-point Likert scale (1 = very unhappy, 5 = very happy).

Controls. The study controlled for participants’ age, gender, readiness and English language skills. Readiness refers to each student’s prepare dness level before the project starts, as procedures. A mini measured by a test assessing their understanding of project parameters and TOEFL test evaluates English language skills (20 TOEFL-style multiple-choice questions testing the knowledge of English grammar, vocabulary and reading comprehension).

The results were tested using SPSS. We ran multiple regression models bas subsamples containing only one of these equity groups: Benevolents, Equity Sensitives and Entitleds.
