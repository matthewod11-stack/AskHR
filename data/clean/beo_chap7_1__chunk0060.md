# of overconfidence of top managers.

What does overconfidence of workers mean in the agency model? There are many

ways to model overconfidence and it is an open question what these different types

of overconfidence imply in equilibrium, or in practice. One possibility is that peo-

ple overestimate the output x; they will generate. For example, they may assume

a distribution m(6;) that first-order stochastically dominates the true distribution

m(@;): observationally equivalent to overestimating luck. Or they may overestimate

the marginal productivity of their effort, df (e;, s;)/de;. In either case they may

work less hard than if they were not overconfident. Assume for example, that their

wage schedule includes a piece rate 6. At the correct optimum effort with no over-

confidence (and corresponding optimal piece rate), agents misperceive themselves

as working too hard because they overestimate expected output and, consequently,

underestimate marginal utility. As a result, overconfident agents may cut back on

effort. In theory, firms will increase the piece rate 6 to induce more effort, but for

reasonable specifications this compensatory effect will not be strong enough to push
