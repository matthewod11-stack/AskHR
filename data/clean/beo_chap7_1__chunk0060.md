## wages and effort back to the no-overconfidence point.

A different possibility is that overconfident workers think they are more skilled

than they really are (i.e., they overestimate their value of s;). Whether overconfident

workers of this sort work too little or too much will depend on whether effort and

skill are complementary, and on the types of contracts firms can offer. For example,

if e; and s; are complements, the firm can offer a contract that pays a large bonus if a

very high output level is achieved (similar to backloaded option packages which are

common in biotechnology firms, or highly leveraged venture capital deals offered to

founders hungry for capital). Workers who overestimate their skill s; will perceive

the marginal return to effort as higher than it actually is and will work hard to grasp

the brass ring. If this is true, we would expect to see extraordinary bonuses being

offered by firms, to exploit overconfidence, accompanied by high actual failure rates.

The opposite of overconfidence might be important in worker motivation as well.

Psychiatrists discuss an “impostor syndrome” in which workers discount their own

success, or attribute it to luck, and feel that others have been fooled into thinking

they are talented (see, for example, Kolligian and Sternberg 1991). Self-perceived

“impostors” may work harder than others if they think that they have talent but need

to work even harder to achieve true success.

More generally, there are important caveats to applying the evidence of wide-

spread overconfidence to organizations. Rather than assuming that agents uni-

formly overestimate their abilities, researchers need to account for heterogeneity

and attempt to evaluate ex ante indicators of overconfidence. For example, some

studies show that women are less overconfident than men, which might be impor-

tant for personnel selection. Seventy- to eighty-year-olds are also less overconfident
