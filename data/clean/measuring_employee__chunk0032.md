# 6.3 Individual-level actions

Opportunities for training and personal development that are focused on strengthening employees’ capabilities to perform well.

“longside the engagement indicators, the scores from the (cid:513)personal development(cid:514) section (qs 1 to 3) may be useful to examine here (i.e. KF6, 7, 8, 10, 26). If a notable proportion of employees have not received or had access to training or a development review in the last 12 months; are viewing the training and development opportunities they have received as not helping them to perform better; and are feeling that such opportunities are of little value or are unrelated to their job, then this could be limiting their level of engagement. In addition, West and Dawson (2012) found that good quality appraisals significantly boosted engagement levels within the NHS. Therefore, increasing the access and quality of training, learning and development via good quality appraisals and one-to-ones could be an important aspect within an engagement strategy for such an NHS organisation. Personal development is a core part of the staff engagement star; a framework to improve staff engagement within the NHS (see www.nhsemployers.org for more detail).

Redesigning or reconfiguring job roles to increase intrinsically motivating elements.

In addition, discussing the individual(cid:514)s job role preferences and interests, perhaps through one-to-one sessions or supervisions, and how the organisation can better meet these, such as by expanding the job role or developing a career progression plan. Alongside the engagement indicators, the scores from the (cid:513)job design(cid:514) and (cid:513)job satisfaction(cid:514) sections (cid:507)qs (cid:348) and (cid:350)(cid:508) may be useful to examine here (cid:507)i.e. KF (cid:343) and (cid:344)(cid:345)(cid:508). If, on average, employees perceive that they do not have clear and achievable goals, feel generally unsupported and unrecognised by others around them, perceive that they do not have a lot of choice over how they work and have little responsibility for their work; then employees may not be engaging in their work as fully as they could be. Therefore, improving the setting and implementation of work goals, the rewards

and recognition of employees, and the autonomy and responsibility given to employees, may form a crucial part of an engagement strategy for an organisation experiencing these problems.

“lthough the suggestions above have focused on (cid:513)problem(cid:514) or (cid:513)low-scoring(cid:514) areas, it may be that a different approach may suit your Trust. It is inevitable that staff engagement within a Trust will change over time, and that the approach to fostering engagement will also need to adapt in light of these changes. Hendrika Santer Bream, Change Manager, Organisational Development, at Guy(cid:514)s and St Thomas(cid:514) NHS Foundation Trust, reflects on how the approach taken to improve engagement within her Trust has moved from a focus on low-scoring areas indicated by the survey to a focus on the high-scoring areas:

(cid:515)At Guy's and St Thomas' we have been interested in improving staff experience as well as staff engagement for a number of years. Back in 2004/2005 we had very disappointing staff surveys and our action planning at that time was focussed on addressing specific low scores. Later, our staff survey results started to improve and also our thinking developed. By 2010 we were still concentrating on developing action plans that would address the specific scores where we underperformed but we were trying, as far as possible, to have actions that would address several scores in one. So, for instance, developing our work on values and behaviours would address several key findings at once. Now our staff survey findings are generally excellent – over the last few years we have been well above average on all three of the Key Findings that make up the overall staff engagement score, and are now the 4th best for acute Trusts. Therefore, we are taking a slightly different approach this year by looking at the positives and our strengths - recognising what we have achieved and identifying what we have done to achieve that. From this (cid:513)“ppreciative Inquiry(cid:514) approach, we aim to develop a very small number of interventions to address a couple of areas of concern, yet the focus will be on what is good already and trying to build on that. This way we hope to change the perception about our overall levels of engagement (i.e. from paying attention to what is wrong to paying attention to what is working) and at the same time continue to refresh our approach to engaging our staff.(cid:516)
