## HBR / Digital Article / Let’s End Toxic Productivity

What’s more, the rise of generative artiﬁcial intelligence (gen AI) is

further skewing our ideas about productivity. I ask you this: If gen AI

is here to save us time in minutes and hours, then how will we measure

productivity? If someone is done with their work early because of AI,

shouldn’t that be rewarded? Toxic productivity will never end — and

may even get worse — unless we start measuring goals achieved, not

hours worked.
