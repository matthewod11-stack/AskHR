Ethical learning doesn’t happen by rote. Employers should foster an environment that encourages workers to become more ethical by practicing moral reflection.

Ethical learning is a lifelong process, and it doesn’t hap- pen by rote (do this, don’t do that). Neuroscientiﬁc research suggests that when faced with moral quandaries, we fall back on prototypes, or mental models. Our moral evolution requires us to add to and update those prototypes as we gain experience. So in addition to preparing people for onetime moral challenges, employers should foster an environment that encourages them to become more ethical in the long run by practicing moral reﬂection.

The beneﬁts of ethical organizations are well docu-

Second, work and life are more tightly intertwined than

ever before (a trend exacerbated by the pandemic). The boundaries between our personal and professional lives have become blurred. That has happened not only because we spend so much time at work but also because of a push, especially among Millennials and younger workers, for greater authenticity—a desire to “bring one’s whole self to work.” Activism on the job is on the rise, with employees banding together at companies including Facebook and Google to encourage leaders to address issues such as diver- sity, immigration, and political discourse.

mented: Such organizations are more attractive than others to employees, are less likely to become embroiled in scan- dals, and are more likely to be rewarded by investors, who increasingly focus on good governance and strong cultures as sources of sustainable value creation. In a previous article, “Building an Ethical Career” (HBR, January–February 2020), we wrote about a bottom-up approach to ethics, describing how individuals could take ownership of their moral development at work. In this article we draw on evidence from hundreds of research studies in business, psychology, and ethics to present a top-down approach to helping workers build moral character. Together the two approaches highlight the workplace’s potential to be a moral laboratory where people can ﬁnd the opportunities and support to learn and grow.

Third, we are likely to face ethical situations at work that we might not encounter anywhere else. Will we bribe a government oﬃcial to secure a lucrative contract? Will we pad our expense account or “cook the books?” Will we speak up if we witness a boss bullying or harassing a subordinate? And more recently, should we enforce mask wearing? Can our employees work from home? At our jobs we have regu- lations to follow, customers to serve, contracts to uphold, and communities to engage with. Experience with each can foster ethical learning over time.

How can employers help their employees use the workplace as a laboratory for character development? To answer that question, we’ll start by examining the role that experience and reﬂection play in the evolution of moral character.
