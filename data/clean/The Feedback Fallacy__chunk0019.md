# hers.

Just as your doctor doesn’t know the truth of your pain, we don’t know

the truth about our colleagues, at least not in any objective way. You

may read that workers today—especially Millennials—want to know

where they stand. You may occasionally have team members ask you

to tell them where they stand, objectively. You may feel that it’s your

duty to try to answer these questions. But you can’t—none of us can.
