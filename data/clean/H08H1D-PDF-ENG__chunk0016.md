# areas of our lives.

Hold fast and stay true.

“Hold fast” is what sailors used to tell one another during a storm —

grab on to something secure, in other words, to prevent yourself from

being swept overboard. “Stay true,” for its part, was an instruction for

the sailor at the helm, who had to watch the compass carefully to avoid

being blown oﬀ course.

Both expressions are useful as metaphors in our current moment:

Leaders in these challenging times need to make sure that they and

their colleagues hold fast, and they themselves need to stay true to

their course. Not only that, they need to remember what every sailor

knows: that all storms ultimately subside, and the key to weathering

them successfully has a lot to do with your preparation and judgement.

. . .

It’s worth thinking back to how the world looked in 2020, when we

suddenly found ourselves confronted with the pandemic — and when

we surprised ourselves with our resourcefulness and resilience. Our

organizations adapted rapidly and eﬀectively to challenges that only

a few months earlier would have been unimaginable.

Many of the changes forced upon us during that period are now part of

our collective sense of how to get things done. We have made them our

own. That’s a cause for hope. Knowing that we survived the collective

challenge of the pandemic, we can and should feel conﬁdent that we

will make it through the new challenges that we’re facing. The key is

to recognize that beyond the immediate anxiety and confusion, liminal

experiences can be invitations to reﬂect, reach out, and reorient — not

simply to feel lost at sea.
