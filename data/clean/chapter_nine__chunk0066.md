Shared governance contributes to an atmosphere of ‘respect’ for staff (Boyer, 2005; Bamford-Wade and Moss, 2010); enabling evidence use from a variety of sources (e.g. audit, feedback, reflective practice, research) (McCormack et al., 2002; Owen et al., 2001) to inform internal debate (Martin, 2000) and decision making (Manley, 2001; McCormack et al., 2002).

Subsequently, it is important to recognise that systems are also required to support and recognise active learning outcomes and accredit work-based learning locally if learning from work related activity such as practice development, innovation and quality improvement is to achieve practice transformation in the workplace (Manley et al., 2009). Such systems would include staff support and development, such as, provision of supervision, mentorship and coaching to enable staff to develop the skills required for facilitating others’ effectiveness (individual and team) through work-based learning and practitioner-inquiry approaches (Manley and Titchen, 2011).

The development, implementation, continued evaluation and adaptation of systems that reflect core values in the workplace requires skilled facilitation in the workplace as near to the point of care as possible (Manley, 2001; Manley and McCormack, 2003; Titchen, 2000). Skilled facilitators draw on a specific skill set that enable practitioners to develop their expertise in using and developing evidence in practice, learning in and from practice, working with stakeholders and evaluating their practice at the individual and team level as well as developing skills as transformational leaders (Webster, 2009; Manley and Webster, 2006). The ongoing presence of skilled facilitation is one of several enabling factors needed to sustain the attributes of an effective workplace culture.

The enabling factors for an effective workplace culture Having evidenced the presence, or absence, of the five attributes, clinical leaders and facilitators will need to consider those factors that enable the development or sustaining of an effective workplace culture. Enablers identified are classified as either individual or organisational in their focus.

Individual enablers include the presence of transformational leadership (Shermont and Krepcio, 2006; Bamford-Wade and Moss, 2010) particularly in ward managers (Scott et al., 2005; Patterson et al., 2011) skilled facilitation (Manley, 2001) and role clarity (Raiger, 2005).

Leadership is key to cultural change (Bate, 1994), particularly transformational leadership (Manley, 1997; 2001). Leadership also includes paying attention to culture (Jones and Redman, 2000; Manojlovich and Ketefian, 2002); role-modelling shared values (Bevingtone et al., 2004b; Binnie, 2000; Haworth, 2000), and achieving a common vision through engaging hearts and minds (Davies et al., 2000). Some disagreement exists about whether transformational leadership by immediate supervisors (Block, 2003), rather than more distant leaders (Stordeur et al., 2000) is more influential in achieving job satisfaction and organisational commitment.

Transformational leadership shares some similarities with skilled facilitation of others’ effectiveness however few authors make a clear distinction between the processes used in leadership and those used in facilitating others’ effectiveness (Manley, 2000b; 2001; Rycroft-Malone, 2004; Binnie, 2000). Whilst some do not refer to facilitation at all (Clark, 2002; Haworth, 2000), others recognise that change, (cultural and other) is facilitated not managed (Marshall et al., 2002; Moss et al., 2008).

Transformational leaders and skilled facilitators act with a moral intent, using sociological, psychological and learning theories, multiple intelligences and teaching/learning skills that enable individuals and teams to change themselves and their context for the better (in this case, an effective workplace culture). Strategies for developing clinical leaders and facilitators with the requisite skills and values are essential for achieving cultural change (Manley et al., 2009; Webster,
