# and inclusion.

The ideal of a merit-based society is attractive. And it might

possibly work—in a world where a homeless child has the same

opportunities as a trust-fund baby, everything is disability-accessible,

and women’s contributions are not ignored. But in the world we

live in, true meritocracy, where everyone plays on an even ﬁeld,

requires the removal of many unfair barriers. It requires inclusion.

By removing systemic barriers, organizations can create environments

where inclusion enhances meritocracy and merit mechanisms enhance

inclusion, ensuring that talent and eﬀort genuinely determine success.
