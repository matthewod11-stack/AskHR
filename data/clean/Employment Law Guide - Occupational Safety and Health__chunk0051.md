## Non-recordable Injury and Illness Incidents.

Electronic Injury Reporting. Certain employers must electronically submit to OSHA information about

recordable injuries and illnesses entered on their previous calendar year's OSHA Forms 300A, 300, and 301

using Injury Tracking Application (ITA)'. Establishments covered by Federal OSHA can use the ITA Coverage

Application to determine if they are required to electronically submit their injury and illness information to

OSHA. Establishments covered by an OSHA-approved State Plan should directly contact their State Plan.
