# Be Specific with Your Questions

If you work for a leader who always changes their mind, asking “What

do you think?” will put you on the fast track to a mountain of rework.

When asked for general feedback, most bosses will come up with

something to change or add. It’s your job to point them to where they

can be most helpful. Deﬁning the feedback scope is crucial.

Let’s go back to our example of the customer feedback project plan.

After you do a tee-up, make a speciﬁc feedback ask, such as: “I’m

interested in your thoughts on the timeline I’ve laid out. Do you think

it’s realistic or too ambitious?”
