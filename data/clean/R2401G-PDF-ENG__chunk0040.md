## Collaboration Overload, Rob Cross describes “Scott” as an executive

who was “ﬂying up the hierarchy” of a large company until he took

charge of three big units—some 5,000 people. Scott had had just a few

direct reports in past roles; he had 16 this time. He wanted to be “less

hierarchical,” so he urged people “to bring him problems and concerns

or to include him in discussions.”
