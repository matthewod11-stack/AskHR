# The Difference It Makes

many cases, management simply relied on its preconceptions about what was important to customers, employees, suppliers, investors, or other stakeholders rather than verifying whether those assumptions had any basis in fact. Overlooked were questions like, Do expe- rienced employees make fewer errors, and, if so, should we do whatever we can to reduce turnover? (Not before testing the hypothesis and determining which employees matter most.) Does accelerating product-develop- ment time lead to increased market share? (Not if our new products are only minutely different from our earlier models, or we have merely reverse-engineered those of our com- petitors.) If companies don’t investigate whether there is a plausible causal relation- ship between actions and outcomes, they con- demn themselves to measuring aspects of per- formance that don’t matter very much.
