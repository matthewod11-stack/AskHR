more time for other things? Do you reallocate time for personal or work-

related tasks? How frequently do you waste the time you saved?

The researchers found that gen AI saved the managers about two hours

and 50 minutes a week, on average. Eighty-two percent of them said

that the technology helped them do their jobs faster. But many in that

group failed to fully capitalize on their freed-up time: Thirty-six percent

of them admitted to wasting more than half of it. Similarly, 83% of

people in the gen AI user group who saved time admitted to wasting

at least a quarter of it. When asked how they did use their extra time

productively, more than half of the managers said they just did more of
