## relationship — as well as potential remedies for the negative impacts of

passing responsibility.

Across our studies, which included 2,478 U.S. participants in a mix

of controlled experiments and surveys, we found that delegating

decision-making responsibilities, compared with asking employees for

advice and maintaining decision-making responsibility, had signiﬁcant

interpersonal costs for delegators. But we also found material ways

that managers can alter how and when they delegate decisions, so that

employees feel empowered rather than burdened.
