## For example, a data analyst with superior visualization skills could

seamlessly shift from creating complex data models to crafting visual

reports, depending on project needs. The analyst would follow a

specialized training regimen tailored to enhance speciﬁc skills, such

as advanced visualization techniques and data storytelling. By focusing

on the analyst’s unique strengths and broader skill set, the organization

not only hones their existing expertise but also creates a more well-

rounded, versatile professional.
