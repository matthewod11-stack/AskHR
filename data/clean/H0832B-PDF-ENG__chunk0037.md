# the program (73%).

However, a more comprehensive approach can embed the alumni

program throughout the employee lifecycle. In this situation, the

organization considers the alumni program to be an integrated part

of the total employee experience. For example, some companies

introduce the alumni program during new employee orientation,

while other companies, like McKinsey and McDonalds, introduce the

alumni program as early as the recruitment stage to attract potential

employees. In doing so, the organization positions the alumni program

as another beneﬁt of becoming an employee and signals that they

support employees in their career development even if that means

taking them to a diﬀerent employer. This support ranges from enabling

access to a broad network that includes current and former employees

to opening up job opportunities at the organization if they choose to

come back one day down the road.

Investing in employees and treating them well is a critical element

for organizational success. But in today’s dynamic labor market

environment, focusing only on retaining employees may be ﬁghting

a losing battle. Instead, by developing relationships with alumni,

organizations can continue to reap the beneﬁts of investments made

in employees even after they’ve exited.
