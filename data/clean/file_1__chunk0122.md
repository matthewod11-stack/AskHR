that male employees have been socialized to achieve satisfaction from outcomes such as pay and knowledge about it, while female employees have been socialized to achieve satisfaction from the process of interacting and the procedural system in general rather than being keen on the knowledge of pay.

Based on social comparison theory and the gender socialization perspective, I thus propose that although female employees are often under-rewarded, they might perceive pay inequity to a lesser extent than their male counterparts due to differences in gender socialization.
