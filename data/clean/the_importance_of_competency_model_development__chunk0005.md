## of knowledge, skills and attitudes where:

- Knowledge is the facts and (cid:191)gures, concepts, ideas and theories that have already been identi(cid:191)ed and support understanding of a speci(cid:191)c (cid:191)eld or topic. Skills are de(cid:191)ned as the ability and capacity to carry out certain processes and use existing knowledge to achieve results.

- Attitude is described as the person’s mindset and intention to act or react to an idea, persons or situation (CEU, 2018).

Another similar competency model has been developed, i.e. the Iceberg Competency

Model (see Figure 1), which includes the components as follows:

- Skills ● Knowledge ● Attitude ● ● Motivation ● Achievement (Salleh et al., 2015) Interpersonal skills
