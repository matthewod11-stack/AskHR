# the worst.

Many companies aspire to coordinate a sustained, cross-functional

response to rapidly evolving market conditions, and many fail.

Winning companies in their environment share two traits. First

is their willingness and ability to embrace the change and move

forward, even with imperfect information and even if they have to

change course midstream. Second is their determination that, even

while improvising, they’re guided by four points of a compass: cash,

commercial eﬀectiveness, customers, and risk. Companies that keep

this compass in front of them set themselves apart by translating acute

challenges into the very means of achieving competitive advantage and

learning as they go. After all, in this environment, no deliberate strategy

—memorialized in binders full of carefully crafted PowerPoint slides—is

likely to last. This is all about emergent strategy, which is driven by

on-the-ground realities and responding to unforeseen changes ahead.
