# What Do Effective Real Managers Do?

Once we answered the question of what successful managers do, we turned to the even more important ques- tion of what effective managers do. It should be emphasized once again that, in gathering our observattonal data for the study, we made no assumptions that the successful real managers were (or were not) the effective managers. Our participant observers were blind to the research questions and we had no hypothesis concerning the relationship between successful and effective managers.

We used the relative strength of correlational rela- tionship between the real managers’ effectiveness index and their directly observed day-to-day activities and found that communication and human resource management activities made by far the largest relative contribution to real man- agers’ effectiveness and that traditional management and — especially — networking made by far the least relative contribution.°

These results mean that if effectiveness is defined as the perceived quantity and quality of the performance of a manager's unit and his or her subordinates’ satisfaction and commitment, then the biggest relative contribution to real manager effectiveness comes from the human oriented activities — communication and human resource manage- ment. A representative example of this effectiveness profile is found in the following manager’s comments:

What does this mean? It means that in this study of real managers, using speed of promotion as the measure of success, tt was found that successful real managers spent relatively more time and effort socializing, politicking, and interacting with outsiders than did their less successful coun- terparts. Perhaps equally important, the successful real man- agers did not give much time or attention to the traditional management activities of planning, decision making, and controlling or to the human resource management activities of motivating/reinforcing, staffing, training/developing, and managing conflict. A representative example of this profile would be the following manager’s prescription for success:

“Both how much and how well things get done around here, as well as keeping my people loyal and happy, has to do with keeping them tn- formed and involved If | make a change in procedure or the guys upstairs give us a new process or piece of equipment to work with, | get my people’s input and give them the full story before | lay iton them Then | make sure they have the proper training and give them feedback on how they are doing When they screw up, | let them know it, but when they do a good job, | let them know about that too ”

“1 find that the way to get ahead around here is to be friendly with the right people, both inside and outside the firm. They get tired of always talking shop, so ! find a cormmon interest — with some it’s sports, with others it’s our kids — and interact with them on that level. The other formal stuff around the office is important but | really work at this informal side and have found it pays off when promotion time rolls around ”

This manager, like our study of real managers in general, found that the biggest contribution to effectiveness came from communicating and human resource management
