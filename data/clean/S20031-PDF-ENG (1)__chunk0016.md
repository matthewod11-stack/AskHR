# For a couple of decades most

organizations and executives felt good about this: They were dealing with the problem. But sexual harassment is still with us, as the #MeToo movement has made clear. Today some 40% of women (and 16% of men) say they’ve been sexually harassed at work—a number that, remarkably, has not changed since the 1980s. In part that could be because women are now more likely to use the term “harasser” than “cad” for a prob- lem boss. But given how widespread grievance procedures and forbidden- behavior training have become, why are the numbers still so high?

That’s an important question, and we recently decided to try to answer it. We did so by taking a serious look at what happened at more than 800 U.S. companies, with more than 8 million employees, between the early 1970s and the early 2000s. Did the programs and procedures that these companies intro- duced make their work environments more hospitable to women? We focused in particular on how those initiatives affected the number of women in the

managerial ranks. We tested two hypoth- eses: First, if the programs and proce- dures are working, they should reduce the number of current and aspiring female managers who leave their jobs because of sexual harassment—and thus we should find more women in manage- ment over time. Second, if the programs and procedures are backfiring, current and aspiring female managers should be leaving their jobs in even greater num- bers, and the overall number of women in management should be declining. Our study revealed some uncom- fortable truths. Neither the training programs that most companies put all workers through nor the grievance procedures that they have implemented are helping to solve the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace. In fact, both tend to increase worker disaffection and turnover. To us the takeaway seems clear: The programs and procedures that the Supreme Court favored in 1998 amount to little more than managerial snake oil. They are doing more harm than good.

We have to do better. The good news is that our study revealed ways in which we can.
