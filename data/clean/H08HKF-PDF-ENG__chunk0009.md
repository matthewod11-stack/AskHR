# HBR / Digital Article / Designing a Responsible AI Program? Start with this Checklist

to implement, scale, and maintain an enterprise-wide RAI program. If

your organization can answer “yes” to all of these questions, it’s likely

in a good position to implement. If you answer “no” to any of them,

program and waiting to complete the design until the answer is yes.

While this may feel like a step backwards, it will ultimately propel implementation faster and more eﬀectively than charging ahead.
