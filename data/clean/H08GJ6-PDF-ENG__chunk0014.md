# An Internal Committee Scores

If you work for a smaller ﬁrm with a strong focus, you are probably

looking at a bunch of comparable projects. Handset maker Sony

Ericsson, for example, each year evaluated about 20 to 30 proposals

for new phones of various shapes and functionality, and funded many

of them. Their core portfolio management team consisted of ﬁve

experienced decision makers. In such situations, you may well opt for

a scoring approach. For example, ask everyone to allocate points for

projects’ commercial attractiveness. Then tally the points and proceed

with the projects that garnered most.
