## Emerging Symbols of Professionalization (1940–1970)

Despite the general expansion of school psychology from 1920 to 1940, only a few symbols of professionalization were evident (training and credentialing), and they appeared in only a few locales. Even a code of ethics had yet to be ofﬁ- cially adopted, although the APA would celebrate its 50th birthday in 1942. The period 1940 to 1970 would see the fur- ther expansion of these symbols and the emergence of others in the form of organizational identity, literature, professional recognition, and accreditation. By the mid-1960s, the ﬁeld was rapidly expanding through training, credentialing, and employment that set the stage for the Thoroughbred Years to follow.
