organizations might be less likely to ask for pay increases than those employees, who are not resigned with gender inequality, and, thus, do not accept it (Lockwood, 1986).

The finding that lower-level white-collar employees and ordinary workers perceive workplace gender inequality to a greater extent than employees in supervisory or management positions as well as upper-level white-collar employees constitutes one of the contributions of the thesis. To the best of my knowledge, none of the previous studies examined how employment position can have an impact on employees’ perceptions of gender inequality. I also did not expect that this dimension would have a significant influence on employees’ perceptions of gender inequality.

Several explanations are relevant in enlightening why employment position had a considerable impact on employees’ perceptions of gender inequality. The potential exists for employees in lower-level positions to acknowledge their lack of privilege and for employees in upper-level positions to obtain better treatment (Rosette and Thompson, 2005). That might be the reason why employees in upper-level positions were less conscious of workplace gender inequality than employees in lower-level positions. Similarly, the structural model of organizational behaviour (Kanter, 1977) suggests that position in the organizational hierarchy influence employees’ behaviour and perceptions. According to the model, employees in lower-level positions may attribute their disadvantages at work to structural factors and thus be more conscious of gender inequality.

This finding supports cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957), attribution (Weiner, 1980, 1992) and sociometer (Leary, 1999) theories, which were discussed in subsection 2.4.1. Based on the theories, this finding suggests that those employees, who are in higher hierarchical positions and who are thus privileged in organizations, are least likely to see the problem of gender inequality. In addition, employees who are in higher hierarchical positions might be responsible for possible cases of gender discrimination or benefit from gender status quo. Indeed it can be in their own interest not to respond to the suggestion that gender inequality exists in their companies and organizations.
