# Determining Training Needs

Conducting a needs analysis is the first step in developing an employee training system (Noe, ). The purpose of needs analysis is to determine the types of training, if any, that are needed in an organization, as well as the extent to which training is a practical means of achieving an organization’s goals. The importance of needs assessment was demonstrated by a meta-analysis indicating better than normal training effectiveness when a needs assessment had been done prior to the creation of the training program (Arthur, Bennett, Edens, & Bell, ). As shown in Figure ., three types of needs analysis are typically conducted: orga- nizational analysis, task analysis, and person analysis (Goldstein & Ford, ).
