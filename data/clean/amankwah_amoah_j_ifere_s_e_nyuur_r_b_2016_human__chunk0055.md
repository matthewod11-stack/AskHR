# Information hoarding

Our findings suggested that some regional managers deliberately desist from sharing

information about underperformance in an attempt to conceal their contributions and thereby

creating conditions for strategic persistence to occur. Many of the informants attributed

managers’ ability to keep underperforming workers in their places of employment to

“information hoarding”, where they decide not to communicate or withhold information

about a subordinate’s persistent underperformance to the superiors. By being able to hoard

such information or failure to volunteer performance information, line managers contribute to

keeping underperforming workers in their jobs. As one head of government agency asserted:

“I cannot act in the vacuum … if people send me information (incorrect) that everyone is

doing well then I cannot sanction anyone. This is the root of the problem.” (G16)

As another informant noted:

“Sometimes we have to wait a long time before getting a report (on job performance) from

our branches … we can only act quickly if the information arrives on time.” (G18)

Government bureaucracies in both countries were also identified as a major factor in

restricting flow of knowledge about underperformance from local branches to headquarters.

Such intentional practices create conditions for persistence with underperformance to occur.

The information asserted that efficient organisation of their firms relies heavily on diffusion

of information from the branches to headquarters. Lack of effective flow not only affects

quality decision making but also creates conditions to maintain the current course of action.

Thus, we propose:

Proposition 4: Information hoarding is more likely to lead to poor attributions of
