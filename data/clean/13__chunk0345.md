## The Past, Present, and Future of Dynamic Performance Research

the identiﬁcation and removal of intrinsic and extrinsic source of criterion unreliability in measures of job performance over time (Barrett et al., 1985; Sturman et al., 2005).

Nonetheless, the question of ‘‘is performance dynamic?’’ as deﬁned in this paper, is resolved. There is no need for future research speciﬁcally to address this question. However, the ﬁeld is still far off from a clear understanding of what happens to job performance over time, what causes it to be dynamic, how effectively selection devices work over time, and how human resource interventions can be used to affect job performance when considered in a longitudinal context.
