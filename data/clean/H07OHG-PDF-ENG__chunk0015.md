Verizon, another Multiverse customer, uses the apprenticeship model

to ﬁll software engineering jobs and reports that 95% of an initial

cohort accepted full-time oﬀers at the company after completing an

apprenticeship program. The Verizon program was designed to “lower

barriers to entry to software jobs while training truly great software

developers that we fundamentally believe can propel our business

through digital innovation,” said Shankar Arumugavelu, Verizon’s chief information oﬃcer.

Apprenticeships aren’t right for all training needs. For one thing,

they require a signiﬁcant investment of time — in the U.S., formal

apprenticeships are usually four years long. In some markets they

can also come with restrictive regulation. In the UK, for instance, the

government’s apprenticeship funding program has been criticized for

being too rigid and not in line with employers’ needs.
