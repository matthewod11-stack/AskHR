## 400 • HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, Winter 2000

… the presence or availability of a grievance procedure is associated with lower involuntary employee turnover, longer job tenure, greater human capital, and increased productivity. Actual use of the grievance procedure, however, is associated with poorer organizational performance, specifically, lower productivity, lower product quality, and higher labor costs.

can be explained by a “displacement effect” in that time normally devoted to production is instead devoted to grievance filing and settle- ment. The size of the productivity and cost effects reported in the aforementioned stud- ies, however, seem too large to be fully ac- counted for by such a displacement effect. Moreover, a study by Kleiner, Nickelsburg, & Pilarski (1995) of grievance procedures and firm performance in a large unionized aero- space company found that the lowest levels of unit labor costs were associated with a “moderate” level of grievance activity.

The idea, drawn from economic theory, that choices (made by consumers, producers, employees, and other economic actors) are guided by relative costs and benefits has been used to generate additional theorizing about and empirical research on grievance proce- dures. For example, Ichniowski and Lewin (1987) developed a compensating differentials framework of analysis in which union and management decisions to adopt or not adopt grievance procedures can be viewed as one alternative among a range of bargaining choices and human resource practices. In other words, grievance procedures may be traded off for wages, benefits, work rule changes, or other conditions of employment. Similarly, such a cost-benefit framework can be usefully applied to the behavior of workers in deciding whether or not to file grievances. Cappelli & Chauvin (1991) tested an effi- ciency model of grievances in which employ- ees compare the cost and benefits (or effectiveness) of grievance filing with such other options as exiting (quitting) the firm or remaining silent. These authors proposed that the costs of exit and thus grievance filing rates depend on labor market conditions. Specifi- cally, both wage premiums in a plant (com- pared with rates prevailing in the local labor market) and unemployment in the local labor market were hypothesized to increase the costs of exit and lead to more frequent grievance filing. Cappelli & Chauvin’s (1991) findings from a study of 86 plants in a large manufac- turing firm supported these hypotheses.

Using an agency theory framework, Kleiner, Nickelsburg, & Pilarski (1995) hy- pothesized that management monitoring of employees would be positively related to griev-

ance filing. The researchers were unable to develop a direct quantitative measure of such monitoring. They did find, however, that the planned monthly production rate and the change in the time span required for the completion of one unit of output (in the afore- mentioned large unionized aerospace firm) were, respectively, negatively and positively related to grievance filing rates. This study, when set alongside other labor economists’ research on grievance procedures, raises an important question about the possible causal relationships among production requirements, grievance behavior, and productivity (as well as other organizational outcomes).

In sum, there are some key findings for se- nior human resource and labor relations execu- tives from economics-based research on grievance procedures. Perhaps most impor- tant, the presence or availability of a griev- ance procedure is associated with lower involuntary employee turnover, longer job ten- ure, greater human capital, and increased pro- ductivity. Actual use of the grievance procedure, however, is associated with poorer organizational performance, specifically, lower productivity, lower product quality, and higher labor costs. Grievance filing is also positively associated with in-plant pay premiums (over which management exercises some control) and negatively associated with local area un- employment (over which management exer- cises little or no control).
