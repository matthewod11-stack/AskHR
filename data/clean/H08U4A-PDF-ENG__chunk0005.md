 and uncertainty are expressed and

managed). This data is integrated into each manager’s performance

review, highlighting and rewarding positive behaviors and reinforcing

accountability. Framing kindness as a professional capability reinforces

that it is a critical skill linked to success within the organization and not

# just a nice-to-have trait.

SAP, known for its inclusive workplace practices and neurodiverse

hiring, runs the Autism at Work program to teach managers how

to support psychological safety and kindness in action. They receive

training to develop skills to manage conﬂict, communicate in a clear

and kind fashion, and promote inclusive team behavior. This program

has been linked to gains in productivity, engagement, and retention.

- 2. Establish clear expectations.

To embed kindness in an organization, it must be as clearly deﬁned and

reinforced as safety, quality, and professionalism are.

One organization that does this is the All Blacks, New Zealand’s national

rugby team. It enforces a strong behavioral standard that team members

exhibit humility, show respect for others, and act responsibly in team

matters. It leaves no room for unchecked ego. It is reﬂected in selection

decisions and teamwork on and oﬀ the ﬁeld. Senior players are expected

to take charge of cleaning the locker rooms after games. Players are

expected to call each other out for behavior that doesn’t reﬂect the

norm. And no matter how talented they are, if someone’s behavior

erodes the team cohesion and culture, he is out.

Another example of creating speciﬁc expectations for kindness is the

Cleveland Clinic’s Communicate with H.E.A.R.T. training program for

all its healthcare workers. Its mnemonics such as “S.T.A.R.T. with

Heart” provides employees with an easy way to remember how to

## meaningfully connect with others during everyday conversations: Smile

## and greet warmly; Tell your name, role, and expectations; Actively

## listen and assist; build Rapport and relationships; Thank the person.

The Clinic has institutionalized this model of professionalism into

every aspect of its organization— from onboarding and training to

performance feedback—and has visibly displayed it in staﬀ spaces.

All staﬀ should know that they are expected to treat colleagues

## and customers, as well as external stakeholders such as suppliers

## and distributors, with kindness in every interaction and exceptions

—say, for having a bad day—won’t be tolerated. They should be

made to understand that even mild displays of unkindness impact

performance, trust, and morale. And just as workplaces have systems for

reporting safety concerns, they should have trusted, formal processes

for reporting concerns about unkind behaviors, especially in high-

## pressure, fast-paced, or customer-facing environments.

Managers at all levels should set the tone—by acting as a role model

and by what they do and don’t allow. Organizations can support them

by teaching them how to reinforce expectations, including what to do

when people fall short.

Some organizations can serve as models. One is the U.S. Department

of Veterans Aﬀairs, where civility training is part of leadership

development and includes learning to manage
