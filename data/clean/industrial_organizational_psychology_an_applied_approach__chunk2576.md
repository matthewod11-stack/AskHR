# Upward Communication

Upward communication is communication of subordinates to superiors or of employees to managers. Of course, in ideal upward communication, employees speak directly to management in an environment with an “open door” policy. In fact, the quality of upward communication is a significant factor in employee job satisfaction (Miles, Patrick, & King, ). Such a policy, however, is often not practical for several reasons—perhaps the most important being the potential volume of communication if every employee communicated with a specific man- ager. Direct upward communication also may not be workable because employees often feel threatened by managers and may not be willing to openly communicate bad news or complaints.

To minimize the number of different people communicating with the top executive, many organizations use serial communication. With serial commu- nication, the message is relayed from an employee to her supervisor, who relays it to her supervisor, who, in turn, relays it to her supervisor, and so on until the message reaches the top. Although this type of upward communication relieves the top executive of excessive demands, it suffers several serious drawbacks.

chapter 

The first is that the content and tone of the message change as it moves from person to person. As will be discussed later in the chapter, messages are seldom received the way they were sent—especially if the message is being passed orally from person to person.

The second drawback to serial communication is that bad news and com- plaints are seldom relayed, in part due to the stress associated with delivering bad news (McKee & Ptacek, ). Rosen and Tesser () have labeled this reluc- tance to relay bad news the MUM (minimize unpleasant messages) effect. The MUM effect negatively affects the organization by keeping important information from reaching the upper levels. But for an employee, the MUM effect is an excel- lent survival strategy—no one wants to be the bearer of bad news. When bad news is passed on to supervisors, employees tend to use politeness to soften the news (Lee, ). Interestingly, people have no problem passing on bad news to peers, especially when the organizational climate is generally negative (Heath, ).

Serial communication’s third drawback, especially with informal communi- cation channels, is that it is less effective the farther away two people are from one another. That is, a supervisor is more likely to pass along a message to another supervisor if the two are in close physical proximity. It is unlikely, therefore, that an informal message originating with an employee at a plant in Atlanta will reach another employee at the corporate office in Phoenix. The importance of physi- cal proximity cannot be overstated. In fact, a major source of power often comes from being physically near an executive. Seasoned executives have been known to place rising executives in distant offices to reduce their potential power. And going to lunch “with the guys” has long been recognized as a means of obtaining new information and increased power.

As one would imagine, proximity does not play a role when messages are com- municated electronically using email (Valacich, Parantia, George, & Nunamaker, ). Thus, email may reduce the power of proximity when communication is formal.

Because of these problems with serial communication, organizations use sev- eral other methods to facilitate upward communication: attitude surveys, focus groups, suggestion boxes, and third parties.

Attitude Surveys Attitude surveys are usually conducted annually by an outside consultant who administers a questionnaire asking employees to rate their opinions on such fac- tors as satisfaction with pay, working conditions, and supervisors. Employees are also given the opportunity to list complaints or suggestions that they want man- agement to read. The consultant then tabulates the responses and reports the findings to management.

For example, Office Depot annually surveys each of its , employees. The -item survey is administered electronically and is written in the eight languages most commonly spoken by Office Depot employees. Within four weeks after the surveys have been completed, the results are posted on a secure intranet site where managers can see the results that pertain to their area. Managers then use the results to create their action plan for the coming year (Robb, ).

Although attitude surveys are commonly used, they are useful only if an orga- nization takes the results seriously. If an organization finds that its employees are unhappy and does nothing to address the problem areas, the survey results will not be beneficial. Furthermore, to increase trust, an organization should share survey results with employees.

If survey results are to be shared, then management must share all of them. While proposing a project to a local police department, I encountered a great deal of hostility from many of the senior officers. After a little probing, the offi- cers revealed that several years earlier they had completed an attitude survey for the city. A few months later, the results were made public. The city cited five main complaints by the officers and promised that action would be taken to solve these problems. The officers were happy until they realized that none of their complaints about pay and working conditions were included in the report—the city was ignoring them. The officers became so resentful and mistrustful of con- sultants and management that they vowed never again to participate in a project.

Focus Groups and Exit Interviews A second method of upward communication is to hold focus groups, in which an outside consultant meets with groups of current employees to get their opinions and suggestions. This information is then passed on to management. To spur candid responses, the consultant is not told the names of the employees in the focus group, and no direct quotes that could potentially identify a particular employee are passed on. Exit interviews with employees voluntarily leaving an organization also provide an excellent source of information. Although these interviews can be emotionally charged, an organization can learn much by listening to the “real” reason that an employee is leaving the organization (Frase-Blunt, ).

Suggestion Boxes A third method for facilitating upward communication is the use of -- numbers or suggestion or complaints boxes. Theoretically, these two boxes should be the same, but a box asking for suggestions is not as likely to get complaints as a box specifically labeled complaints and vice versa. The biggest advantage of these boxes is that they allow employees to immediately communicate their feelings in an anonymous fashion. Suggestion boxes provide a safe voice for subordinates and customers, and essential feedback to the organization as well (Phillips, ).

For these boxes to be beneficial, management must respond to the sugges- tions and complaints in a timely manner. Management can do this by placing the suggestions/complaints on a bulletin board or the organization’s intranet along with management’s response. In this way, employees receive feedback about their ideas, which further encourages other employees to use the boxes to communicate.

Some organizations take suggestions quite seriously and reward employees who provide useful ideas. Hercules, Inc., for example, provides cash awards up to $, for employees who suggest money-saving ideas, Texas Industries in Dallas provides bonuses that can reach % of an employee’s salary, and Ingersoll- Rand gives plaques to employees who submit cost-saving ideas that are ultimately adopted by the company. In a study of organizations encouraging suggestions, the Employee Involvement Association found that over % of employees submitted at least one suggestion, approximately % of suggestions were adopted, and the value of the typical suggestion was ten times greater than the cost of rewarding the suggestion (Wells, ).

Third-Party Facilitators The use of a third party such as a liaison or an ombudsperson is another method that can increase upward communication. Both are responsible for taking employee complaints and suggestions and personally working with management
