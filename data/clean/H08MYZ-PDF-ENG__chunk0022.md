## AI-generated cover letters sound inauthentic, lack passion, and can

read as generic, formal, or too “perfect” compared to how a human

would communicate information. If you prompt AI to “Draft a business

operations cover letter,” for example, everyone else who asks the same

question will be submitting the same cover letter, and companies may

dismiss your application without taking the time to understand whether

you have the exceptional written communication skills you purport to

have on your resume.
