I/O psychologists who work in the private and public sectors perform similar duties as consultants, but they do so in very different environments. I/O psychologists who work in the private sector work for a single company such as IBM, Microsoft, and FedEx, whereas consultants work with many companies. I/O psychologists in the public sector work for a local or state government or for the federal government. Though the private sector often pays more than the public sector, many employees believe the higher job stability of the public sector offsets the potential for lower pay. Though master’s and doctoral level graduates can be found in all employment areas, Ph.D.s are much more likely to be employed in an academic setting; master’s level graduates are more often employed as HR generalists, data analysts, trainers, and compensation analysts (Schippmann, Schmitt, & Hawthorne, ).

As you can see by the job titles listed in Table ., there are many careers in I/O psychology, ranging from entry-level jobs to presidents and CEOs of large companies. Whether one wants to work in the public or private sector, work with data or work with people, spend the day talking, writing, or analyzing, there is some job or the other in I/O psychology that fits everyone.
