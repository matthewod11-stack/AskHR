For example, in game theory players are in equilibrium when their beliefs about what other players will

do are accurate, and they choose best responses given those accurate beliefs. A neural analogue of this

mathematical is that brain activity in equilibrium will be highly overlapping when players are making their own

choices, compared to when they are forming beliefs about choices of others, because creating accurate beliefs

requires them to simulate choices by others. Indeed, Bhatt and Camerer (2005) found very little difference in

brain activity between choosing and guessing in periods in which players’ choices and beliefs were in

equilibrium. Thus, game-theoretic equilibrium is a “state of mind” as well as a restriction on belief accuracy and
