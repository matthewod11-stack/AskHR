Drug and Alcohol Abuse Unfortunately, as stress levels rise and anger increases, often so does the abuse of drugs and alcohol. Most incidents of domestic and other types of violence occur after an individual has been drinking or using drugs. This doesn’t excuse the violator’s behavior, but it does indicate the relationship of drugs and alcohol to anger and rage. And there are an increasing number of news reports of vio- lence occurring in the workplace. Of those violent events, many are carried out by employees who have abused drugs and alcohol.

Because of the increasing problems of drug and alcohol abuse in organizations, many companies have set up employment assistance programs (EAPs) to which they refer employees suspected of drug or alcohol abuse, as well as those who are depressed and experiencing other problems. EAPs use professional counselors to deal with employee problems. Some large companies have their own EAP counsel- ors, but most use private agencies, which are often run through local hospitals.

Many organizations also offer stress management programs that help people learn how to cope with stress. Having such organizational programs that can be used as a positive outlet for stress and the problems that come from it can often be beneficial to employees’ regaining control over their lives.

Because many of our behavioral responses to stress are learned, the nega- tive ones can be unlearned. Stress management teaches us positive and healthy behavioral responses. The key is to acknowledge the occasions on which you use destructive methods and to take measures to correct them. If you don’t, you won’t like the consequences that result from improperly managed stress.

As organizations recognize the consequences of stress, they are beginning to take better precautions against it. For example, free voluntary counseling is made available by many organizations to all employees exhibiting emotional or discipline problems and particularly to those who have been terminated or laid off (Mantell & Albrecht, ).

Health Care Costs One other organizational, as well as personal, consequence of stress is an increase in health insurance premiums. Because of the high use of medical facilities and options by others suffering from illnesses caused by stress, organizations that at one time paid the full cost for health insurance benefits are passing the increases on to the employees. This additional financial burden to some employees can be a new source of stress! The answer is to reduce the number of ailments causing stress, thereby decreasing the need to seek medical attention.

Managing stress, or better yet, changing your behavior to healthfully respond to stress, should occur before, during, and after stress (Tyler, a). Managing stress before it happens means incorporating daily practices (e.g., exercise) that will prepare your mind and body to handle the effects of stress. During stress you should continue with your prestress management techniques (such as reducing caffeine), as well as incorporate some others. Finally, after the stressor is elim- inated (if that’s even possible!), continue to proactively manage your stress. In addition, there are some other things you should consider. Let’s examine some techniques for before, during, and after stress.
