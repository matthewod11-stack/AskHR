## HBR / Digital Article / How to Delegate to Someone Who Doesn’t Report to You

Follow up without overstepping.

Checking on delegated work with peers requires ﬁnesse. Instead of

“Where are we at with this?” which may seem like checking up on them,

try, “Is there anything you need to keep this moving forward?” or “What

obstacles can we help clear?”

Rather than “Is this done yet?” try, “I’d love your thoughts on what

you’re seeing in the data so far” or “I’m curious how the new process is

working from your perspective.” Show you value their judgment, while

subtly getting details about the status.

Maybe they agreed to updates but you’re hearing nothing, or they

respond with vague answers. Refer back to your shared agreements:

“When we kicked oﬀ, we talked about weekly recaps. We count on those,

so what can we do to get those each Monday?” or ask, “When you say it’s

moving along, what stage are we at?”

. . .

At ﬁrst, sideways delegation can feel slower and more cumbersome than

handing something oﬀ to your team. But once trust is built and you’ve

dialed in your process, you can each achieve unprecedented results.
