# The Ethics Behind Workplace Privacy

You read in your textbook that drug testing, of-

fice and locker searches, psychological testing, and electronic surveillance are legal, with few

restrictions. Genetic screening checks for genetic abnormalities in healthy people at risk for devel- oping certain diseases in the future. This type of screening can be used to screen job applicants and employees who may be likely to develop disease

if exposed to certain worksite substances such as chemicals or radiation. And even though President George W. Bush signed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act on May 21, 2008 that prohib- its employers from firing, refusing to hire or other- wise discriminating against workers on the basis of genetic information, there is still fear that it will be used for just that reason.

Proponents for such practices in the workplace say that these types of practices can protect and help employees, consumers and/or companies. Electronic surveillance such as email, Internet, and telephone monitoring, and use of video cameras is a proactive step toward catching potentially harmful or illegal behaviors by employees. For example, by monitoring Internal emails, management can learn about inappropriate emails of a sexual or discriminatory nature directed toward a specific employee or employees and can take immediate action to stop this behavior. And this type of monitoring can help employers more fairly evaluate employee performance, because managers are able to track both good and bad behaviors throughout the day by monitoring emails, Internet usage, and telephone conversations. For example, there is software that can be used to view an employee’s screen while they are working, count keystrokes of data entry personnel to track speed and reliability, and track the amount of time an employee’s computer remains idle. This type of soft- ware is beneficial to both employees and employers. And genetic screening, according to its sup- porters, can keep both employee and employer safe. Research has identified about fifty genetic disorders that could increase a person’s susceptibility to toxins or chemicals. For example, people with sickle cell trait could be at risk for sickle cell anemia if exposed to car- bon monoxide or cyanide. Genetic screening could re- duce certain people’s chances of getting such diseases, which would spare them from spending thousands of dollars in medical bills and from premature death. Employers would benefit from the savings incurred from less workers’ compensation payments, health care premiums, low productivity, and high absenteeism and turnover. And, job applicants don’t have to agree to the screening. According to defenders of this practice, those applicants have the right to seek employment else- where. Of course, this area of concern may be a moot point since President Bush signed the Genetic Informa- tion Nondiscrimination Act on May 21, 2009.
