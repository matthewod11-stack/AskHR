# Building Your Vision

New CEOs invariably will be asked dozens of times: What’s your

new strategy? In the ﬁrst few months, employees don’t expect a

new CEO to have all the details ﬁgured out, but they do want

clarity on direction. We’ve found that the most successful CEOs

articulate the big strategic questions the organization must address,

while simultaneously launching focused actions—for example, shifting

delivery to be more AI-driven, expanding into certain markets, or

creating enough room in the P&L to invest in growth. They use these

early, no regret, moves to signal where the organization is heading, even

as the vision and related strategic actions are still being developed.

These leaders also recognize that their teams want clarity of purpose—

why does the organization exist, and how, you, as a leader will create a

vision that will help to address these fundamental questions. As you’re

preparing to introduce your vision, ask yourself:

- What actions can we take now that will drive immediate impact for

where the organization is headed?

- Is the organization currently clear about how it creates value and the

big strategic questions that must be addressed?
