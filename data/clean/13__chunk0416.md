with regard to the form of the data, but limited ﬂexibility with regard to the error structure. In contrast, LGCM allows for more choices for modeling the error, but less ﬂexibility in terms of the data’s structure (Raudenbush, 2001). If one has unbalanced data, the LCGM is simply not an option (unless missing data techniques can make the data balanced, but this will be discussed later). HLM provides the ﬂexibility to model this sort of data structure and determine the nature of employee trends. On the other hand, if one is testing or otherwise cannot accept the assumptions regarding the error structure (or other factors that can be manipulated in the SEM-base LCGM method that cannot be changed in HLM), then the ﬂexibility of LCGM makes it a more desirable option. Ideally, this choice should not simply be guided by the convenience of data availability, but be driven by a strong theoretical rationale or the need for speciﬁc hypothesis testing.
