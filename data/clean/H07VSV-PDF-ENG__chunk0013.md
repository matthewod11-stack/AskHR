# the project goals.

Getting the team together to re-establish or re-deﬁne these goals can

breathe a second life into the project — assuming the context hasn’t

changed so much that the project is no longer relevant. No one likes

working on “road to nowhere.” Research from the Standish Group

shows that more than 30% of projects will get cancelled prior to

completion. According to Antonio Nieto-Rodriguez, author of HBR’s

Project Management Handbook, “Consider revising the project charter

if necessary.”

As part of this process, make sure you have executive sponsorship for

the project. The TeamStage study also shared that 62% of successfully

completed projects had supportive sponsors. Nieto-Rodriguez shared

that “Having a high-level executive articulate the project’s importance

to the organization can give the team a renewed sense of purpose.”
