# 2.4.2. Perceptions of gender pay gap

The gender pay gap exists almost all over the world (e.g., Corporate Gender Gap Report, 2010). Since in most cases female employees are subjected to unequal treatment, they should be more likely to question the disparity of pay than their male colleagues (Graham and Welbourne, 1999). Despite the intuitive logic of this assumption, not many studies have supported it (Nie et al., 2002). In contrast, most empirical research demonstrates that female employees tend to perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than their male counterparts (Keaveny et al., 2007; Kray et al., 2001; Peng et al., 2009).

For example, in order to discover the attitudes of Europeans towards the gender pay gap, the European Commission launched a two phase European-wide communication campaign on the gender pay gap in 20094. Based on the campaign, a study, conducted by the Eurobarometer (2009), found that around half of Europeans consider the gender pay gap as one of the priorities for action in the field of gender equality. Moreover, around 82% of Europeans think that the issue of the gender pay gap should be addressed urgently.

From the above-mentioned examples it is seen that while academic research has shown that female employees tend to perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than their male counterparts (Keaveny et al., 2007; Kray et al., 2001; Nie et al., 2002, Peng et al., 2009), the Eurobarometer (2009) has found the opposite. More theoretical and empirical work is thus needed to shed light on the question of whether and to what extent individuals perceive the gender pay gap to exist, how sensitive they are towards it and which factors can explain their perceptions.
