Phase one A three year action research study formed the initial basis for the framework (Manley, 2001; 2000a; 2000b; 2002; 2004). Manley’s study drew on the culture literature preceding the year 2000, most of which focused on business insights into corporate and organisational culture, to make sense of the processes and outcomes of a transformation project exploring the role of the consultant nurse in facilitating quality care in a healthcare practice setting (Manley, 1997). As well as identifying a number of cultural change processes, this study identified cultural indicators that described a transformational culture. Manley described a transformational culture as one that:

‘…changes its form and disposition, readily adapting and responding to a changing context, but based on fundamental core values that in turn enable individuals to develop their own potential, and their practice too. Such a culture nurtures and enables innovation through practitioner empowerment, practice development and a number of other workplace characteristics - all prerequisites to quality patient care.’ (Manley, 2004, p 51)

To build on these insights, a formal two phased project followed (phases two and three) under the auspices of an International Practice Development Colloquium (a co-operative inquiry of practice developers and researchers from healthcare and educational organisations) which led to the identification of data to construct the framework. How this data was collected and analysed is described below.

Phase two Verbal and written data, including research evidence and expert opinion were gathered during an International Practice Development Colloquium on Theory Development in July 2003. Thirty three practice developers (from Australia, England, Netherlands and Northern Ireland), used Meleis’s (1985) theoretical analysis tool to undertake a rigorous and collaborative analysis of the key frameworks informing practice development and cultural change activity at the time (Habermas, 1972; Manley, 1997; 2001; Manley and McCormack, 1999; McCormack, 2001; Hoogwerf, 2002; Titchen and McGinley, 2003; Manley and McCormack, 2003; Rycroft- Malone, 2004; McCormack, Manley and Wilson, 2004). This led to data that informed a tentative understanding of the different attributes, enabling factors and consequences of an effective workplace culture.

Phase three The research team comprising of five practice developers/researchers (Kim Manley, Kate Sanders, Shaun Cardiff, Lyn Garbarino, Moira Daven) clarified their values and beliefs about culture and change (see Box 1) prior to undertaking a systematic review of the literature between 2000-2006 to enable their own assumptions to be made explicit. The data from the review challenged and refined the emerging understandings from phase two. Literature prior to 2000 was unanimously focused on business culture and had been included in the literature review of Manley’s (2001) doctoral thesis and synthesised with the findings of her study to describe the characteristics of a transformational culture.
