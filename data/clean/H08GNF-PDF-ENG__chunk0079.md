# actions within the teamwork.

- Focus on me, me, me: It’s not about how great you are. Instead, talk

about how your work brought value to the company.

- Memorize scripts: Don’t read notes or reply in a way that sounds

robotic or unnatural—this can be detrimental to your success.

. . .

Mastering the STAR framework is an ongoing learning process. By

practicing and reﬁning your responses, you can become a more

conﬁdent and eﬀective communicator, which will increase your

chances of landing your next job opportunity.
