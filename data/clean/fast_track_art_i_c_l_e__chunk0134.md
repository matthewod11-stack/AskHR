# HERO Scorecard

Q27. Does your organization offer on-site

(or near-site) preventive health screenings, or conduct special campaigns to promote screenings (beyond providing coverage for screenings through a health plan)? (check all that apply) Yes, we provide on-site or near-site

0 = No, we do not provide

on-site health screenings or screening campaigns

0.5 = Yes, we conduct

None of the respondents provided only awareness campaigns so coding was dichotomous for on-site or near-site screenings
