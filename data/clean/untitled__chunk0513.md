# Funding

Critical to the growth of comparative psychology was the availability of funding. Prior to World War II, most fund- ing for research came either from local sources or from private foundations, with prospective recipients making the rounds seeking research support. An exception was the Rockefeller Foundation–funded Committee for Research in Problems of Sex (Aberle & Corner, 1953). The explosive growth of support for scientiﬁc research not only increased the funding available but changed the pattern to one that in- volved the submission of research proposals that were subse- quently subject to peer review.

I have analyzed funding patterns for comparative psychol- ogy for 1948–1963 at both the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) (Dewsbury, in press-b). According to my analysis, the NIMH awarded a total of 117 grants in comparative psychology for approximately $5.6 million during this period. The mean grant was for 2.5 years with an annual budget of under $20,000. The NSF program in psychobiology, not begun until 1952, awarded 72 grants in comparative psychology for a total of over $1.4 million with a mean size much smaller than those from the NIMH. The top-10 grant getters at the NIMH were Harlow, Lehrman, John Paul Scott, Richter, Eckhard Hess, Nissen, Beach, William Mason, M. E. Bitterman, and Schneirla. Half of those—Beach, Harlow, Lehrman, Nissen, and Richter—were elected to the National Academy of Sciences of the United States. Nissen, Schneirla, and Richter
