Spend a little time at the outset asking yourself speciﬁcs about the goal,

like: How much time can I commit to? Do I want to set one overarching

goal (like running a marathon) and then set smaller goals to help me

achieve it (like joining a running group)? What days will I work on this

goal? What will “success” look like to me in this context?

While many assume that the self-development in leisure means taking

on time-consuming hobbies, even small adjustments (e.g., setting a

distance intention before a walk or deciding to engage more socially

in a hobby) can yield beneﬁts. But do not let your approach to leisure

become so serious that you create a scenario in which both work and

non-work activities make you feel burnt out. Start small and set a goal

that makes sense for you.
