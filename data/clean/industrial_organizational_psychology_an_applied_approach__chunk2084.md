# and merit pay.

Pay for Performance. Also called earnings-at-risk (EAR) plans, pay-for-performance plans pay employees according to how much they individually produce. Simple pay-for- performance systems with which you are probably familiar include com- mission (being paid for each unit of something sold) and piecework (being paid for each unit of something produced).

The first step in creating more complicated pay-for-performance plans is to determine the average or standard amount of production. For example, the aver- age number of envelopes sorted by mail clerks might be  per hour. The next step is to determine the desired average amount of pay. We might decide that on average, our mail clerks should earn $ an hour. We then compute the piece rate by dividing hourly wage by the number of envelopes sorted (/), which is ..

Thus, each correctly sorted envelope is worth  cents. If a mail clerk is good and sorts  envelopes per hour, he will make $ per hour. If our clerk is not a good worker and can sort only  pieces per hour, he will make $ per hour. To pro- tect workers from the effects of external factors, minimum-wage laws ensure that even the worst employee will make enough money to survive. As suggested in Figure ., most organizations provide a base salary to ensure that employees will have at least minimal financial security. In fact, research indicates that employ- ees paid a flat hourly rate plus a performance bonus perform at levels equal to employees who are paid on a piece-rate plan (Dickinson & Gillette, ).

A good example of such a plan comes from the Superior Court Records Management Center in Phoenix, Arizona (Huish, ). After conducting a study that showed a negative correlation between employee salary and productivity (r = −.), the clerk of the court decided to try a pay-for-performance system. Each employee was given a base salary of $. per hour and, on the basis of the quantity and quality of his work (Table .), could earn incentive pay. This pay- for-performance intervention resulted in an average increase in employee pay of $. per hour, a reduction in cost per unit (a unit was a court document page transferred to microfilm) from  cents to  cents, and a decreased need for storage space.

Theraldson Enterprises in Fargo, North Dakota, changed its compensation system for the housekeepers employed in its  hotels. Rather than being paid by the hour, the housekeepers were paid by the number of rooms they cleaned. This change saved the company $ million per year and resulted in the housekeepers
