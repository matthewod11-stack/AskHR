CAN YOU TAKE COGNITIVE BIAS OUT OF ASSESSMENTS? A classic study by Edward Jones and Victor Harris in the 1960s demonstrated that people tend to attribute others’ behavior to character rather than circumstances. When a car goes streaking past us, for instance, we think that the driver is a jerk and ignore the possibility that there might be an emergency. A good workplace example of this cognitive bias—known as the “fundamental attribution error”—is forced ranking. Separating employees into “A,” “B,” and “C” players assumes that the strongest performers are the best workers and the weakest are the worst; it overlooks the impact of good or poor management,

not to mention business conditions that employees can’t control.

Of course, this model is highly ﬂattering to people who have advanced into executive roles—“A” players whose success is, by deﬁnition, credited to their superior abilities, not to good fortune. That may be partly why the model has persisted so long in the face of considerable evidence against it.

Even when “A” players seem to perform

well in many contexts (and that’s rarely measured), they may be coasting on the “halo eﬀect”—another type of bias, akin to self-fulﬁlling prophecy. If these folks have already been successful, they receive more opportunities than others, and they’re pushed harder, so naturally they do better. Biases color individual performance

ratings as well. Decision makers may

give past behavior too much weight, for instance, or fall prey to stereotypes when they assign their ratings.

But when you get rid of forced ranking and appraisal scores, you don’t eradicate bias. Discrimination and faulty assumptions still creep into qualitative assessments. In some ways the older, more cumbersome performance systems actually made it harder for managers to keep their blinders on. Formal feedback from various stakeholders provided some balance when supervisors were otherwise inclined to see only the good things their stars did and failed to recognize others’ contributions.

Anytime you exercise judgment, whether

or not you translate that to numerical ratings, intuition plays a part, and bias can rear its head.

seems to be extending beyond the United States as well. PwC reports that two-thirds of large companies in the UK, for example, are in the process of chang- ing their systems.

Three Business Reasons to Drop Appraisals In light of that history, we see three clear business imperatives that are leading companies to abandon performance appraisals:

The return of people development. Companies are under competitive pressure to upgrade their talent management efforts. This is especially true at con- sulting and other professional services firms, where knowledge work is the offering—and where inexpe- rienced college grads are turned into skilled advisers through structured training. Such firms are doubling down on development, often by putting their em- ployees (who are deeply motivated by the potential for learning and advancement) in charge of their own growth. This approach requires rich feedback from supervisors—a need that’s better met by frequent, in- formal check-ins than by annual reviews.

Now that the labor market has tightened and keeping good people is once again critical, such companies have been trying to eliminate “dissatis- fiers” that drive employees away. Naturally, annual reviews are on that list, since the process is so widely reviled and the focus on numerical ratings interferes with the learning that people want and need to do. Replacing this system with feedback that’s delivered right after client engagements helps managers do a

better job of coaching and allows subordinates to process and apply the advice more effectively.

Kelly Services was the first big professional ser- vices firm to drop appraisals, in 2011. PwC tried it with a pilot group in 2013 and then discontinued annual reviews for all 200,000-plus employees. Deloitte followed in 2015, and Accenture and KPMG made similar announcements shortly thereafter. Given the sheer size of these firms, and the fact that they offer management advice to thousands of or- ganizations, their choices are having an enormous impact on other companies. Firms that scrap ap- praisals are also rethinking performance manage- ment much more broadly. Accenture CEO Pierre Nanterme estimates that his firm is changing about 90% of its talent practices.

The need for agility. When rapid innovation is a source of competitive advantage, as it is now in many companies and industries, that means future needs are continually changing. Because organiza- tions won’t necessarily want employees to keep do- ing the same things, it doesn’t make sense to hang on to a system that’s built mainly to assess and hold people accountable for past or current practices. As Susan Peters, GE’s head of human resources, has pointed out, businesses no longer have clear annual cycles. Projects are short-term and tend to change along the way, so employees’ goals and tasks can’t be plotted out a year in advance with much accuracy. At GE a new business strategy based on innova- tion was the biggest reason the company began eliminating individual ratings and annual reviews
