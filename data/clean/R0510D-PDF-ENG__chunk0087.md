# Knowledge Management.

The exhibit “The New Strategy Calendar” illustrates the activities that a properly consti- tuted OSM will be engaged in during the year. The strategy cycle launches at the beginning of the second quarter, when the OSM starts to plan strategy and update the enterprise score- card. After the enterprise strategy meeting, the OSM starts the process of aligning the organi- zation with the enterprise goals. Before the end of the third quarter, it will be coordinating with ﬁnance to bring unit-level plans and bud- gets in line with strategy, and by the beginning of the fourth quarter, it will be working with HR on aligning the competency development and incentives of employees with scorecard ob- jectives. While these calendar-driven processes are going on, the unit continually engages in control and learning: reviewing and communi- cating strategy, managing initiatives, and shar- ing best practices.
