# execution decisions to their teams.

When a managing director in a large global bank I worked with used

this “best, cheapest” test to consider her portfolio of work, she ended

up ceding 40% of her meetings and 25% of her tasks to the directors

and VPs who reported to her. She found that everyone was happier:

clients, because her team was just as strong as her on most issues

and more responsive than she had been; her employees, because

they enjoyed the exposure, development, and career progression; and

the managing director herself, because she could reﬂect, learn, and

ultimately contribute to a high-visibility strategy project that she hadn’t

previously had time for.
