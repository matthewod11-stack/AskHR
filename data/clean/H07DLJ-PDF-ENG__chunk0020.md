## note about “Queen Bee syndrome,” in the middle of the allies chapter.

And it’s because it’s something we hear a lot: women are terrible

mentors and leaders, and they push other women down. And actually,

I was reading a number of studies. One of them, the most salient said

that that’s only true in a circumstance where there’s only one slot. When

women are competing for the one slot, say, in a law ﬁrm partnership or

in the C-suite, then yes, it’s absolutely competitive. But actually, if you

look at all the studies, when women make it onto boards, when they’re

the CEO or in the C-suite, when they run organizations, they actually

bring more women, more diversity in.

So, if you look at it on a broad scale, it actually is the opposite. And

I hate the idea of “Queen Bee syndrome” because it’s saying, “Women

push each other down.” But that’s absolutely not true unless it’s set

up in a competitive way. Instead, you actually see transformation

happening because women are in leadership positions.

ADI IGNATIUS:

One of the takeaways from your book is that women really will beneﬁt

from having allies, and particularly, sponsors in the workplace. I think

there’s some people who feel like, yeah, I’ve had that or I’ve had that all

my career, and some people who ask how to do it? And so, what is your

advice: how do you get a sponsor who can help you in your career?
