DEB LIU:

Well, ﬁrst, I want to deﬁne what a sponsor is. We often hear about

mentors, people who give you advice, and there’s tons of women who

are over-mentored and under-sponsored. Women are given a lot of

mentors. People give them advice. But a sponsor is someone who puts

their career on the line to open doors for you to actually say, “I vouch

for this person at my own expense should this go wrong.” And women

actually have fewer sponsors. Part of the issues with sponsors is that

people tend to sponsor people who are most like them. When I sponsor

somebody, I’m much more likely, any individual is more likely, to

sponsor somebody who I can say, “I can see myself in that person 10,

20 years ago. I can see them becoming me someday, and I can remember

what it felt like to be in their position.”

But in a workplace where we’re not equal in a number of diﬀerent ways,

it means that those who get sponsored tend to look like the people who

are already there. So, it’s so important to cultivate sponsors. And I often

ask, “How many of you in the audience have a sponsor?” And when

you look around, a lot of people don’t know. And the answer is, if you

don’t know, you don’t have one. Because a sponsor is like a tailwind in

your career. You can feel it. You can feel people pushing you towards

something greater, giving you opportunities you never thought, opening

doors for you. And I greatly beneﬁted from that. I absolutely would not

be where I am today but for the handful of people I wrote about in my

book, who actually accelerated my careers in ways that I could never

have imagined. And without each of those individuals giving me the

tailwinds I needed to get to here, I would not be here. Absolutely.
