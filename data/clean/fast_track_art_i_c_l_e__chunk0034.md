- Count of individuals who completed a baseline health assessment and were,

therefore, eligible for all of the analyses discussed here.

12.7% of the participants completed a total of exactly two calls, whereas 57.2% completed three or more calls. More than one third (36.6%) completed ﬁve or more calls.

Health behavior change was measured by comparing each individual’s baseline HA with his or her follow-up HA taken at least 12 months apart before and after the coaching program. An aggregate measure of behavior change was developed through the following series of procedures. The HA assessed an individual’s ev- eryday health behaviors in nine areas, alcohol use, back care, safe driving, nutrition, physical activity, stress management, tobacco use, weight management, and mental well-being. For each area, an in- dividual was determined to meet or not to meet national guidelines for healthy behavior (see Table 2 for health deﬁnitions of “at risk” for each health area). The number of risk areas that were not within guidelines was summed for each individual. The dependent variable of behavior change was created by subtracting the baseline number of health behavior areas not meeting national guidelines from the follow-up number of areas not meeting guidelines. So if an individ- ual’s health behaviors improved, the behavior change variable was negative. If health behaviors got worse, the variable was positive.
