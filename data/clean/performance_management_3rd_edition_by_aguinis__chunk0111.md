# FACULTY RESOURCES

Each of the chapters includes a list of its learning objectives as well as summary points and cases for discussion. I hope this additional material will allow students to have an enjoyable and productive learning experience that will enhance your own individual human capital. Also, there are several resources available for instructors including PowerPoint slides, exam questions and answers (multiple choice and essay-type), role plays, and approximately 40 additional cases (about 4 per chapter) that can be used for in-class discussions, examination materials, or take-home homework or examinations. These materials will allow instructors to prepare for teaching this course more quickly and help make teaching this course a more enjoyable and interactive experience. These fac- ulty resources can be downloaded by visiting www.pearsonhighered.com/aguinis and clicking on Instructor Resources.
