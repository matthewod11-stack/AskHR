7 The one-parameter version of Prelec’s axiomatically-derived weighting function is π(p)=1/exp((ln(1/p)γ) (where exp(x)=ex). In this remarkable function, the ratio of overweighting π(p)/p grows very large as p becomes very small, as if there is a quantum of attention put on any probability, no matter how low. For example, with γ=.7 (an empirical estimate from experiments), π(1/10)=.165, π(1/100)=.05, and π(1/1,000,000)=.002. This type of extreme relative overweighting of very low probabilities is useful for explaining overreaction to rare diseases (mad cow disease), and the huge popularity of high-prize Powerball lotteries. 8 The coefficient of loss-aversion is defined as the ratio of the limits of marginal utilities at the reference point, where marginal utilities approach from below and above, respectively. This definition allows a “kink” at the reference point which exhibits “first-order risk-aversion” (i.e., the utility loss from a gamble is proportional to the standard deviation, so that agents dislike even small-stakes gambles; Segal and Spivak, 1990).

Choice over ambiguity: Subjective expected utility (SEU) assumes that subjective (or, in Savage’s

term, “personal”) probabilities are revealed by the willingness to bet on events. However, as Ellsberg’s famous

1961 paradox showed (following Keynes and Knight), bet choices could depend both on subjective likelihood

and the “weight of evidence” or confidence one has in the likelihood judgment; when bets are “ambiguous”

decision weight is lower. In SEU, subjective probabilities are a slave with two masters—likelihood and

willingness to bet (or decision weight). As Schmeidler (1989) pointed out, a simple resolution is to assume that

decision weights are nonadditive. Then the nonadditivity is a measure of “reserved belief”, or the strength of the

unwillingness to bet on either color in the face of missing relevant information. Mukerji and Tallon (2004)

describes many theoretical applications of ambiguity-aversion models to contracting, game theory and other
