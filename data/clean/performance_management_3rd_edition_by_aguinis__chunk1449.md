## Chapter 8 • Performance Management and Employee Development

Also, supervisors can help the employee uncover the factors that lead to achieve- ment and job satisfaction by conducting feedforward interviews. Supervisors must reinforce an employee’s accom- plishments toward completing a devel- opmental plan so that the employee remains motivated. Finally, supervisors themselves must be motivated to perform all these functions in support of their employees’ developmental plans. To do so, supervisors’ performance regarding how well they help their employees develop should be measured and rewarded appropriately.

- 360-degree feedback systems are tools that help employees build new skills and improve their performance in general by gathering and analyzing performance information from several sources, includ- ing peers, superiors, subordinates, and oneself. information gathered from oneself is compared to information gathered by other sources to perform a gap analysis showing discrep- ancies between how one sees one’s own performance in relation to how others see one’s performance. These types of systems are also used to identify per- formance dimensions for which all, or most, performance information sources agree there is little or substantial room for improvement. Accordingly, this information can be used in creating a developmental plan.
