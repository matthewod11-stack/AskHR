# BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS OF ORGANIZATIONS

phase and becomes very weak in the hunch phase (in fact some contro] subjects

never got the theory but steadily played the C and D decks);

(iv) half the patients were able to state the theory, but they still played A and B

more than they played C and D!

Normal subjects are responding emotionally to projected actions even before

they can voice a hunch, while patients only have baseline responses, never express

hunches, and do not execute the theory even if they do state it correctly. The data

thus provide another indication that in the brain a complex process is required to

relate evaluations of prior experiences to future actions. That process may affect

action before it affects cognition or even without affecting cognition. Conversely,

the results for the patients show that a cognitive grasp of the situation may be attained

without affecting action.

The examples provided are intended to illustrate how much difference it will

make to economic analysis of organization—and other topics in economics—if the

shift continues from “deviations” to “how the brain works.” The magnitude of the

difference can be seen in the concluding remark of the Camerer-Malmendier review:

Meso concepts like organizational routines and learning are not rooted in individual

behavioral concepts. It is possible that organizational economics could be tied to

meso-organizational (or macro-organizational) constructs, but this is not an active
