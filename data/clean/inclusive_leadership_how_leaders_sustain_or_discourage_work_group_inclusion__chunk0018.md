## Psychological Mechanisms of Leader Inclusion

One key theme in the literature is that leader inclusion is a relational leadership style that promotes psychological safety (Carmeli et al., 2010). Randel et al. (2018) further proposed that work group identiﬁcation and psychological empowerment among employees supervised by inclusive leaders would be enhanced and result in group member contributions. Each of these psycho- logical mechanisms can serve to mediate leader inclusion with important outcomes such as creativity and turnover for the work group and the orga- nization. Such mediation can help to explain why leader inclusion may be effective, as well as provide insight into leader motives for engaging in an inclusive manner with their group members.

Psychological safety “facilitates the willing contribution of ideas and actions to a shared enterprise” (Edmondson & Lei, 2014, p. 24). Research suggests that psychological safety fosters voicing ideas for organizational improvements (Detert & Burris, 2007), the sharing of information and knowledge (Collins & Smith, 2006; Siemsen, Roth, Balasubramanian, & Anand, 2009), taking initiative to develop new products and services (Baer & Frese, 2003), and facilitating teams and organizations to learn and to perform (Bunderson & Boumgarden, 2010; Carmeli, 2007; Carmeli & Gittell, 2009; Carmeli et al., 2012; Collins & Smith, 2006; Edmondson, 1999; Schaubroeck, Lam, & Peng, 2011; Tucker, Nembhard, & Edmondson, 2007). The inclusive leader who is promoting psychological safety is not only facilitating effective performance, but also is creating a work environment in which employees feel they can share their unique perspectives. Thus, employees who perceive that their leader values the ways in which they are unique are more likely to experience psychological safety.

Work group identiﬁcation is deﬁned as “perception of oneness with or belongingness to” the work group (Ashforth & Mael, 1989, p. 34). Being
