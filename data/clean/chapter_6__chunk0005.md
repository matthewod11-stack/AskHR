# 6.1 Cross-Cultural Competence

others they were communicating with had the same cultural background, partici- pants were less explicit with their navigation instructions, relying more on land- marks, whereas participants who thought others were from a different culture, the landmarks would not even be mentioned.

A high level 3C is difﬁcult to ﬁnd among many international assignees. Some have individual dispositions that make them prone to adapting to new situations with ease, whereas for others several actual intercultural experiences and training would be required to have even some competencies, let alone competence. This assertion begs the question: can 3C be trained? According to Wilson et al. (2013) both personality (as measured by the Big 5: openness, conscientious, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) and situational factors (e.g., prior experience abroad, language proﬁciency, cultural distance) inﬂuence whether a person might develop a high level of 3C. Thus, given the right circumstances, a motivated person may be able to develop some level of 3C, but without this motivation to learn, 3C cannot develop. The implications on organizational selection and training are rather straightforward. When selecting a person for an international assignment, be sure to select a person who already has 3C or a person who is highly motivated to learn, open and ﬂexible to new environments, and thoughtful about considering other cultural norms.
