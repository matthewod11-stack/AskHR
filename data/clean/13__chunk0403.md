choice often inﬂuences, or even precedes the analytical strategy. One common approach is hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), often associated with the package ‘‘HLM’’ or ‘‘mixed models’’ from SAS Proc Mixed. The other most common approach, often referred to as a latent growth curve model, or LGCM, is performed using structural equations modeling software such as AMOS, EQS, or LISREL (Raudenbush, 2001). In actuality, both approaches are special cases of the General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) (Rovine & Molenaar, 2001), although they have divergent structures and assumptions which make them different in application. I will brieﬂy review the principles behind the GLMM, highlighting the difﬁculties with this approach and why the other approaches ultimately become more practical alternatives. I will then discuss both HLM and LGCM in turn, including their relative advantages and disadvantages.

The General Linear Mixed Model The GLMM (Laird & Ware, 1982) is an expanded case of the general linear model. The model is as follows:
