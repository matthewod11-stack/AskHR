Thus far, we have analysed the state of the art in coaching, completed the conceptual

framework and established the theoretical framework to provide support for these processes

according to social exchange theory and the RBV. We now conduct the empirical research of

the theoretical questions formulated above.

When an organisation prepares for this process after previously identifying employee needs,

establishing objectives, and supporting and facilitating the process execution (Bolch, 2001),

there is a transmission of knowledge and competences that improve the individual

performance of coachees. Coaching is a tool that is capable of creating value (Hammervoll,

- 2011) that consequently improves the capabilities of human resources. Coaching converts

human resources into an asset that is unique and valuable to the organisation and that is

difficult for competitors to imitate. As Ellinger, Ellinger and Keller (2003) and Luthans and

Peterson (2003) highlight, a coachee will apply his/her new knowledge to daily tasks in his

workplace, affecting positively his individual performance. As a consequence, we can expect

that organisational performance improve. However, to ensure that this outcome actually occurs

in practice, we must first empirically demonstrate the relationship between individual

performance and organisational performance and thus avoid making inferences from one level

to another. Such inferences frequently lead to the so-called fallacies of the wrong level (Allen,
