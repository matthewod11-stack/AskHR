The study sought to find out the extent to which code of conduct affected employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. The study found out that most of the respondents (45%) were of the opinion that it affected employee performance to a moderate extent, 27% cited to a great extent and 28% to no extent at all. This implies that code of conduct affects employee performance to a moderate extent at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. The study results corroborates with the findings of Whitford(2006) who indicated that no code, no matter how severely enforced will make truly bad people good. However, ethics codes can have a demonstrable impact on the behavior of

bad people in organizations. When everyone clearly knows the ethical standards of an organization they are more likely to recognize wrongdoing; and do something about it (Andrew, 2006). Second, miscreants are often hesitant to commit an unethical act if they believe that everyone else around them knows it is wrong. And, finally corrupt individuals believe that they are more likely to get caught in environments that emphasize ethical behavior thus the code of conduct can enhance employee perfomance in an organganization (Armstrong, 2011).
