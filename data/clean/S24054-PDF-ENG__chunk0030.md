# What Helps—and What Gets in the Way

The leadership behaviors I’ve just described can help any individual

improve a team’s performance. But there are also some pretty strong

forces that can work for or against you and inﬂuence how much better a

team can get.

The emotions and behaviors that deﬁne individuals are formed early.

My experience working with hundreds of teammates has taught me

that the core behaviors that make any of us a good teammate—

unselﬁshness, discipline, humility—are wired into us when we’re very

young. If your childhood experiences taught you that people aren’t

trustworthy or don’t follow through on promises, it can be tough

to convince you otherwise when you become a pro athlete in your

twenties. That’s a real challenge. As a society, we should begin more

systematically teaching behaviors around teamwork when kids are in

kindergarten—and even then, there’s no guarantee that those lessons

will make a diﬀerence, especially for children who have unstable family

lives. As members of organizations, whether sports teams or companies,

we need to start focusing on teaching team-centric behaviors to young

people coming up in the ranks. I’m now a part owner of a British soccer

team and a women’s professional basketball team, and I’m trying to

become a part owner of the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders. In these roles, I’m

doing all I can to transfer some of the leadership lessons I learned in

my athletic career to the next generation of players. But again, that can be diﬃcult, because by the time athletes reach the professional ranks,

many of their values and their ability to adapt and manage emotions

are fully formed. That’s why scouts and general managers talk so much
