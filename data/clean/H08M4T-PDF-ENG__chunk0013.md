# Interrupt your autopilot.

Attention comes in diﬀerent forms, says Mark. There’s the intentional

kind, where we’re consciously focused on a speciﬁc task, such as

writing a complex report; and the automatic kind, where actions occur

without deliberate thought — like when you reﬂexively grab your

phone, swipe it open, and scroll through Instagram mid-workday. To

break these unconscious habits, Mark says you need to cultivate meta-

awareness: observing your mental processes as they unfold. “It’s like

slapping yourself awake and saying, ‘Pay attention!’” When you feel

the impulse to check social media, pause, and ask yourself: What’s

driving this behavior? Am I procrastinating? Am I avoiding challenging

work? Asking these questions transforms an unconscious habit into

a deliberate choice. “Meta-awareness is like a muscle — the more

you practice catching and redirecting your attention, the stronger it

becomes.”
