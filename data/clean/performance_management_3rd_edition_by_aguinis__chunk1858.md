Membership configuration includes how long the team is expected to work together and the stability of its membership. For example, there can be product development teams, task forces, and committees. Figure 11.1 illustrates the three main types of teams based on task complexity and membership configuration dimensions.

- Work or service teams. These intact teams are engaged in routine tasks, including manufacturing or service tasks. An example is a group of people working at the assembly line in a car manufacturing plant such as Saturn or Saab. The work or service team includes people who have worked together for some time and know each other well. Most members share a similar set of skills.

- Project teams. These teams are assembled for a specific purpose and are expected to disband as soon as their specific tasks have been completed. The tasks are outside the core production or service of the organization and are therefore not as
