We received 131 valid responses comprising 93 stories about child care,

38 about elder care, 18 about caring for someone with a disability,

and six about caring for someone with a long-term illness. (Note that

some respondents told more than one story.) All survey respondents

participated in the paid economy and also provided unpaid, long-term

care for more than six consecutive months. We coded these stories and

aggregated the data into 18 categories. We then identiﬁed three broader

groups based on how respondents demonstrate improved management

skills in the workplace: humanity, productivity, and “cognitivity” — a

term we propose to describe the wide range of mental and emotional

work necessary for the organization to maintain culture, connect

people, and ensure smooth operations.
