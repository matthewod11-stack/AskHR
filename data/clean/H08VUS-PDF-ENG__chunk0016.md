# thinking and working.

I didn’t expect much, just that these pursuits would make my personal

life feel a tad more expansive. But what happened next surprised me.

At work, my team noticed a subtle shift in how I approached creative

reviews. When my internal agency brought an unexpected reference or

an out-of-left-ﬁeld idea, instead of immediately trying to ﬁt it into our

usual framework, I gave it more space to breathe and develop. Dabbling

in art made me more receptive when our designers pushed for bolder

color choices on our assets. My late-night singing sessions reminded me

how freeing it can feel to create without judgment. That carried over

into how I treated rough early-stage ideas and hypotheses. Together,

these changes helped my team and me create the conditions for some

of our most distinctive work. We challenged B2B conventions, delivered

meaningful business results, and earned industry recognition.
