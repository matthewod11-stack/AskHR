country. This hinders the ability of people to further pursue a redress in case their right is infringed (Wu et al., 2022). In the absence of strong counsel, the complaints can either fail to get filed or, should they pass through, then on technical grounds. In addition, some legal procedures may pose a barrier, making people not want to assert their claims at all because of financial or emotional obstacles. 5.4 Workforce Composition and Industry Variations The makeup of the workforce in a particular state and the leading industries in these states influence the ADA implementation greatly in terms of its scope and character. States that have diversified their economies with large services, knowledge, and public sectors have been found to have better compliance (Colker, 2021). It is more coherent that these areas are more likely structured with HR departments, uniform onboarding and training process, and able to provide workplace accommodations. Conversely, the states that depend on farming, manufacturing, or other activities that require manual labor might face a problem in ADA compliance. These industries do not usually have flexible jobs or facilities that can adjust to a wide scope of disabilities (Button et al., 2023). In other instances, physically intensive van occupations may have limited options to adapt to the needs of employees with mobility difficulties unless changing work practices or high-cost modifications in adaptive equipment are made by the employer, an investment which is not a priority. Besides, seasonal and temporary jobs that are typical of such industries may complicate introducing reasonable accommodations and increase the likelihood of employers not fulfilling their long-term requirements to disabled employees (Levine & Karner, 2023). The issue is further eroded by the fact that labor protections in the industries tend to be less as well. 5.5 Intersectionality: Race, Gender, and Socioeconomic Factors Inequality with ADA enforcement is additionally affected by intersectionality; how disability accommodates race, gender, and socioeconomic strata overlap to provide stratified experiences of exclusion. Although ADA is intended to take care of everybody with a disability, it does not exist in a vacuum. As an example, people with disabilities who identify as Black or Latinx tend to be attacked by the so-called parallel injustice, i.e., racial stereotyping, being undervalued in both vocational affairs, and being doubted about their disability (Rothstein,2023). Women with disability might face not only gender discrimination in the workplace but the disability with the considering that the affected women cannot contribute efficiently, especially in managerial positions. People with a low-income family reputation might not have health insurance, transportation, or even legal assistance to file a lawsuit or continue working. Such intersectional forces can even affect the perception and treatment of complaints. Subconscious bias can either influence the believability of a complaint or the urgency of its
