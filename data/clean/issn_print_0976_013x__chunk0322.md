## Robust Practices and Concurrent Strategies

Supply chain evolving triggers have led to several developments in concepts and practices.

However, the quest for robustness and innovation to maintain a competitive edge under any

circumstances needs continuous refinement and performance measures evaluation. Dynamic

supply chain/network structure capabilities are continuously subjected to performance

improvements from individual or aggregated research concepts. The series of shocks and

disruptive events caused by the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak and several geographically

dispersed regulatory constraints hampered the performance of the global supply chain and

resulted in several sufferings.

Research practices developed to date were subjected to critical, practical, and unfamiliar

exposure, wherein most failed in achieving performance improvement and target achievement

under extremely high pressure of demand for essential commodities. As a result, several

organizations went bankrupt, and laying off employees hampering sustainable practices

became common. Human-centric focus and extension of sustainable dimensions/targets to
