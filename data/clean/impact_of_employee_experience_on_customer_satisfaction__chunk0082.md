# c) Cultural Environment

According to Peter Drucker, considered to be one of the most well-known

and important philosophers on management, “Culture eats strategy for

breakfast”. The cultural aspect of EX is the perspective of how

organizations treat their employees, how products or services are

developed, the partnership established, and how employees actually get

their job done.
