# Use Instructions over Constraints

Instructions and constraints are used in prompting to guide the output of a LLM.

- An instruction provides explicit instructions on the desired format, style, or content of the

response. It guides the model on what the model should do or produce.

- A constraint is a set of limitations or boundaries on the response. It limits what the model

should not do or avoid.
