# Integration of Theories

In this chapter, we discussed many theories of job satisfaction. The question you must be asking (other than “When does this chapter end?”) is, “How, then, do we satisfy employees?” Unfortunately, the answer to this question is complex and depends on a variety of factors. We can, however, use the theories to design an organizational climate that is more conducive to motivation and satisfaction than is the typical climate.

As shown in Figure ., individual-difference theories say that each of us brings to a job an initial tendency to be satisfied with life and its various aspects such as work. A person with a low tendency toward satisfaction might start a job with only six hypothetical satisfaction points, a person with a neutral tendency might start with ten hypothetical points, and a person with a high tendency might bring fourteen points.

For example, research indicates that in addition to genetics, such traits as internal locus of control (Stout, Slocum, & Cron, ; Surrette & Harlow, ), Type A behavior, patience/tolerance (Bluen, Barling, & Burns, ), and social trust (Liou, Sylvia, & Brunk, ) are related to our tendency to be sat- isfied with work. Demographically, males and females are equally satisfied with work, Whites are more satisfied than African Americans, and older workers are more satisfied than younger workers (Rhodes, ).

Surrette and Harlow () found that people will be most satisfied with a job if they had the option to choose that job from other alternatives rather than the job
