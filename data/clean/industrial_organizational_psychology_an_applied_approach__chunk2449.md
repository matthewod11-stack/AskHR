## Is There a Chance for Growth and Challenge?

For many employees, job satisfaction is affected by opportunities for challenge and growth. As discussed in Chapter , Maslow thought that the need for growth and challenge, which he labeled self-actualization, is important only after low- level needs (e.g., safety, social) have been met. To help satisfy employee self- actualization needs, organizations can do many things. The easiest and most common are job rotation, job enlargement, and job enrichment. With job rotation and job enlargement, an employee learns how to use several different machines or conduct several different tasks within an organization. With job rotation, the employee is given the same number of tasks to do at one time, but the tasks change from time to time. With job enlargement, an employee is given more tasks to do at one time.

A job can be enlarged in two ways: knowledge used and tasks performed. With knowledge enlargement, employees are allowed to make more complex decisions. With task enlargement, they are given more tasks of the same difficulty level to

perform. As one might imagine, satisfaction increases with knowledge enlarge- ment and decreases with task enlargement (Campion & McClelland, ).

Job rotation and job enlargement accomplish two main objectives. First, they challenge employees by requiring them to learn to operate several different machines or perform several different tasks. Thus, once employees have mas- tered one task or machine, they can work toward mastering another.

Second, job rotation helps to alleviate boredom by allowing an employee to change tasks. Thus, if an employee welds parts one day, assembles bumpers on another, and tightens screws on a third, the boredom caused by performing the same task every day should be reduced.

Perhaps an even better way to satisfy self-actualization needs is through job enrichment. The main difference between job rotation and job enrichment is that with job rotation an employee performs different tasks, and with job enrichment the employee assumes more responsibility over the tasks.

In their job characteristics model that was discussed in Chapter , Hackman and Oldham (, ) theorized that enriched jobs are the most satisfying. Enriched jobs allow a variety of skills to be used, allow employees to complete an entire task (e.g., process a loan application from start to finish) rather than parts of a task, involve tasks that have meaning or importance, allow employees to make decisions, and provide feedback about performance. Hackman and Oldham developed the Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS) to measure the extent to which these characteristics are present in a given job.

If we look again at the job of college professor, job enrichment is clearly an inherent part of the job. That is, the professor decides what she will research and what she will teach in a particular course. This authority to make decisions about one’s own work leads to higher job satisfaction.

With an assembly line worker, however, responsibility is something that must be added because the employee has minimal control over the way a job is done. After all, bumpers must be assembled in the same way each time and welded to the same place. So what can be done to enrich the typical factory worker’s job?

One method is to give workers more responsibility over their jobs. For exam- ple, when an employee first begins working for a company, her work is checked by a quality control inspector. After she has been with the company long enough for the first four needs levels to be satisfied, she is given responsibility for checking her own quality. Likewise, more control can be given to the employee about where and when she will eat lunch, when she will take vacation time, or how fast she will accomplish her work. At one Kaiser Aluminum production plant, for example, time clocks were removed so that the workers could assume more responsibility for their performance by keeping track of their own hours.

Even when increased decision-making responsibilities are not possible, job enrichment ideas can still be implemented. For example, many organizations have or work with credit unions whose credit committees and boards of directors consist of company employees. These committees and boards provide excellent opportunities to increase employees’ decision-making powers even though the decisions are not directly related to their jobs.

Another method to increase the level of job enrichment is showing employ- ees that their jobs have meaning and that they are meeting some worthwhile goal through their work (Hackman & Oldham, ). At some automobile factories, for example, this is accomplished by having employees work in teams to build cars. Instead of an employee performing a single task all day, she does several

tasks, as do the other employees in her group. At the end of the day, the employee can see a completed car that she has had a major role in building.

A plant that manufactures transformers provides another example. The training department realized that even though employees spent eight hours a day manufacturing the product, few understood what it did, who used it, and what would happen if it were not manufactured correctly. To correct this problem, the employees participated in a training session in which they were shown how the transformer was used, who used it, and the consequences that resulted from poor manufacturing.

The final method for increasing employees’ self-actualization needs that we will discuss here is the use of self-directed teams or quality circles. With quality circles, employees meet as a group to discuss and make recommendations about work issues. These issues range from something as trivial as the music played in the work area to something as important as reducing waste or improving produc- tivity. Meta-analysis results indicate that quality circles increase job satisfaction (d = .) and commitment (d = .) for employees in the private sector but not for those in public agencies (Pereira & Osburn, ).

In an extensive review of the literature, Wagner () concluded that allowing employees to participate in making decisions results in small but sig- nificant increases in performance and job satisfaction. Arthur () found lower turnover in steel mills that allowed employees to make decisions on their own than in steel mills with a more controlling style. In a more recent study, Rentsch and Steel () found that job enrichment resulted in decreased absenteeism.

Though team approaches are popular, there is considerable debate about their effectiveness. Most quality improvement programs using a team approach fail to provide the desired results (Zemke, ).
