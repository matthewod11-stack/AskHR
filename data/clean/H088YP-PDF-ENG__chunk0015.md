## disadvantage candidates with social anxiety or neurodivergent

thinking, and thus face greater challenges in these situations. “You’re

not interviewing for the Secret Service,” she says.

Bach agrees. The interview doesn’t have to perfectly mimic the

conditions of the job, but you might want to examine any

“physically and psychologically demanding practices” and perhaps

make adjustments, she says. (More on this later.) Do interviews need

to be all-day marathons? Must they include 90-minute-long on-the-ﬂy

case studies? Do they even need to be in person? “If it’s not part of

the job, you need to ask yourself: Are we creating an environment that

anyone can thrive in? Or are we making it artiﬁcially hard?”

Ask candidates what they need. Unfortunately, there isn’t a one-size-

ﬁts-all solution for making interviews more inclusive, says Bach. “Even

people with the same disability can have diﬀerent symptoms and

severities,” which is why you need to work with individual candidates to

determine what they might need.

Bach suggests creating “a menu of possible accommodations” that

includes examples of what’s been done in the past. This might include

providing extra time for completing tasks or responding to interview

questions, presenting questions in diﬀerent formats to address diﬀerent

learning styles, or conducting remote interviews for candidates who

may have mobility challenges.

Praslova recommends sharing this menu of options with all candidates

and encouraging them to request additional support if needed. “Make it

clear that it’s safe to ask for things and it won’t be held against them,”
