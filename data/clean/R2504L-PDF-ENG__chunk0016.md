## HBR / Magazine Article / Hybrid Still Isn’t Working

are less productive. We also heard that attendees of remote meetings

often multitask and don’t pay full attention. The result is that not only

are participants not contributing meaningfully but also the hosts of

meetings have to hold “postmeeting meetings” to explain to the people

who were distracted what they missed.

The wrong people get promoted. The shift in performance management engendered by remote work has had a strong eﬀect on who gets ahead.

We heard in our focus groups that promotions are now based much

more on individual performance, because that is what managers are

tracking. Managers often have no real idea whether colleagues can get

along with others, let alone manage them, because they rarely see them

interacting with other people. The performance management focus

on KPIs that often accompanies remote work has a serious drawback:

Research led by Alan Benson of the University of Minnesota has shown

that promoting the best individual performers into management jobs

leads to worse team performance.

Culture deteriorates. Organizational culture is commonly deﬁned as

the norms and values that shape how people behave. Employees learn

them not from slogans but from observation—by seeing how a boss

deals with a customer, by having a veteran employee explain the subtext

of a cryptic memo, and so on. When employees can’t make such

observations, the norms and values don’t take hold.

Today, remote and hybrid organizations often have two cultures: the

older one among those hired before the pandemic and the new one

among the workers who came on board in the remote era. That cultural divide aﬀects the interactions between and behaviors of these two employee groups. Because they have diﬀerent ideas about what is

acceptable, employees from both groups may think they are doing the right thing while behaving quite diﬀerently.
