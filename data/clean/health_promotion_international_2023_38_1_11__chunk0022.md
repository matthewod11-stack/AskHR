# (Un)belonging at work

spatio-material dimensions of belonging fuel organiza- tional dimensions of belonging.

Some supervisors are explicitly aware of the impact that spatio-material dimensions of belonging can have and therefore actively shape the dimensions:

During my job interview, they asked me what I would change first. I said, ‘The cardboard should go.’ They were surprised. My office-to-be was a kind of glass fishbowl in the middle of the work- shop. My predecessor covered the window behind the desk with a cardboard so that the employees could not look into the office from a part of the workshop and vice versa. If you are an employee on that side of the workshop, you will feel excluded, and as a supervisor, you will have a long distance from that employee because of that. (field notes)

The emphasis on the feeling to be excluded, due to invisibility, reiterates how spatio-material aspects impact how employees experience in- or exclusion at work and how this may foster or impair one’s feeling to be an integral part of a system and, thus, one’s per- ceived workplace health.
