## countries on economic opportunity and political empowerment.

It’s worth noting the United States is on the low end when it comes to

political empowerment, ranking 98th. Iceland leads on this particular

measure, though even it has seen a slight decrease in the number of

women legislators since 2017. Nicaragua, which ranks second, currently

has the most parity between men and women in government.
