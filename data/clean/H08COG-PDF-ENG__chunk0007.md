Picture yourself in a meeting where a new idea has just been

pitched, representing a major departure from your company’s standard

practices. The presenter is conﬁdent about moving forward, but their

voice is quickly overtaken by a cacophony of opinions from ﬁrm

opposition to enthusiastic support. How can you make sense of the

noise? What weight do you give each of these opinions? And what does

this disagreement say about the idea?
