## Guidelines for Coding Operational Definitions of Trust

Affective. This dimension reflects a belief or perception that one has a special or unique relationship with the referent. Typically, this idea is reflected in a perception that the referent will act in a manner that intends to do good with regard to the trustor, will make sacrifices for the trustor, and will demonstrate concern about the trustor’s welfare, particularly because of the unique relationship. Examples: “I feel a strong sense of loyalty to my leader”; “If I shared my problems with [my leader], I know he would respond constructively and caringly.”

Cognitive. This dimension is typically reflected in a belief or expectation that the referent is reliable, has integrity, is predictable, will tell the truth, will act in a fair or just manner, and so forth. This dimension does not reflect that the trustor has a unique or special relationship with the referent, the referent would be expected to act in this fashion regardless of the identity of the trustor. Examples: “I believe management has high integ- rity”; “[My leader] is not always honest and truthful.”

Willingness to be vulnerable. This measure comprises items that express a willingness to allow oneself to become vulnerable to a partner (i.e., a behavioral intention). Example: “If I had my way, I wouldn’t let top management have any influence on issues that are important to me.”

Overall. This category includes items of more than one definition of trust described above (e.g., affective, cognitive). Items using only the term “trust” also fit into this category (e.g., “I trust my supervisor”).

To be coded as one of the specific dimensions, at least 75% of the items must be from a single dimension. If less than 75% of items are from a single dimension, it is classified in the “overall trust” category.
