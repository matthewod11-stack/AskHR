# Performance Management Process

In theory, the Performance Review process can be thought of as a positive interaction between a “coach” and an employee, working together to achieve maximum performance. In reality, it’s more like finding a dead squirrel in your backyard and realizing the best solution is to fling it onto your neighbor’s roof.

—SCOTT ADAMS (THE DILBERT PRINCIPLE)
