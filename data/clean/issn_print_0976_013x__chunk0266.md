# in critical attributes and

overlapping/dual aspects between the two paradigms. It has been suggested that leanness acts

as a foundation for agility (McCullen & Towill, 2001), or in other terms, agility as a precursor

to leanness (Hormozi, 2001).

The two paradigms were combined to form the so-called leagile paradigm with the

positioning of the de-coupling point. To qualify as successful leagile, lean and agile cannot be

applied at the same point and lean should be applied upstream and agile downstream about

the de-coupling point (Pattanaik,2021). While adopting lean, inventory levels need to be

reduced, but from an agility view, customers are supplied with what they need at the right

time, even with high inventory. Thus, a balance between cost reduction and responsiveness

maximisation is desired; the portion of lean and agile in total SC might change dynamically

and seldom encounters pure leanness, and pure agility may be observed in real business

practices. Hence supply chain approach can be changed according to circumstances. It is not

suitable to declare that one is better and the other is worst. Instead, they complement each

other, and the combination depends upon market conditions (Kisperska & Haan, 2011).
