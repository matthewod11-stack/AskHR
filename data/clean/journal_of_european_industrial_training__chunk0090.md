# . The credibility of the system once

introduced must be maintained. This requires careful consideration of issues of confidentiality and access to the 3608 data. Typically, the recipient is the only individual to receive a copy of the feedback in the organisation. However, this can lead to a lack of motivation to use the feedback report. If the 3608 feedback process is used for managerial decision making, confidentiality and access become problematic.

. The process must have the support of senior management who themselves should take part in giving and receiving feedback and encourage all other managers to do the same. There must be a real determination to use the feedback

data as the basis for individual development planning. The research evidence clearly highlights that no employee should feel threatened by the process and, at all times, the integrity of the system must be ensured.

Kane and Lawler (1978, p. 584) state that ``rather than having any one level do the entire assessment of a person's performance, it is better to have each level contribute to the assessment of the portion that it is able to perform more effectively than any other level''. Indeed, this statement can be considered one of the earlier recommendations in the literature to use multiple raters in the performance appraisal process rather than any one source. The practice of 3608 feedback per se has taken some time to gain momentum but many authors argue that it will become a commonplace HRD activity as we enter the twenty-first century.
