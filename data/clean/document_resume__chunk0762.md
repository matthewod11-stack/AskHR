# Lack of objectivity

Some student raters evaluate her professors on the basis of supposition, euesswork,, and reputation thus defeating the entire purpose of using the rating forms. A student's rating of his/her professor should be based only upon first-hand observations of actual behaviors, not comments made by other students, reputational factors, etc. A student who has not observed a teacher first-hand should not cv aluate that teacher Nor should a student let his/her rating of a professor be influenced by what other students think.

Some student rater, base their entire rating of a professor on one or two instances of extremely good or extremely poor teaching behav Jur, While these isolated extreme Instances should certainly be considered, it is important also to keep in mind the typi- cal, "day-in, day-out" behavior of the professor.

AB students tend to have "first impressions' of their teachers, but some students never change these impressions, even in the face of behaviors to the contrary, and base their ratings exzlusicely on their first impressions. The professor's behavior throughout the quarter should be considered who, his/her performance is being evaluated.

The most common problem involv mg lack of objectivity is allow ing some biasing factor to affect a professor's ratirig. As difficult as n is, student raters should strive not to let such factors as the professor's agc, sex, rank, or appearance, the course's level of difficulty, or the student's own performance (i.e grade in the course) or personal liking or disliking of the professor influence the performance ratings given to thei professor. A student's rating of his/her professor should be influenced only by the professor's actual behavior while teaching the course. not by any biasing factor. Non-teaching behaviors, such as consulting and research, should also typically be ignored when the professor's teaching performance is being evaluated.

B. Common rating "errors" to avoid.
