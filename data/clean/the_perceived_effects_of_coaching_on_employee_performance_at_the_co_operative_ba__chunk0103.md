# 4.2.3(cid:32) Effective Feedback Process

The results of the survey found out that coachees are given an opportunity to

participate in the coaching sessions by asking questions rather than the coaches

providing questions. 71% of the respondents did confirm that constant feedback is

provided to the coachees regarding their performance. Assessments are conducted

at the beginning of a coaching program and continuous feedback was provided.

These responses were captured in question 6A and 8A of the questionnaire. The

results are illustrated in the figure 4.2.3 below.
