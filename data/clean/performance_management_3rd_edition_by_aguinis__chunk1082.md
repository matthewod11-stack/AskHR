## Chapter 6 • Gathering Performance Information

information about whether this supervisor is likely to be motivated to provide accurate ratings. Similarly, are there any positive and negative consequences associated with rating distortion? What is the probability that this will indeed happen? The answers to these questions will determine the supervisor’s motivation to distort ratings.

There are motivational barriers that prevent raters from providing accurate performance information. Raters may be motivated to distort performance information and provide inflated or deflated ratings.37 In fact, supervisors may not even be trying to measure performance accurately and may attempt to use performance ratings for other goals.38 For example, a supervisor may be motivated to provide inflated ratings to

- Maximize the merit raise/rewards. A supervisor may want to produce the highest possible reward for his employees, and he knows this will happen if he provides the highest possible performance ratings.

- Encourage employees. A supervisor may believe that employees’ motivation will be increased if they receive high performance ratings.

- Avoid creating a written record. Asupervisor may not want to leave a “paper trail” regarding an employee’s poor performance because such documentation may eventually lead to negative consequences for the employee in question. This situation is possible if the supervisor and employee have developed a friendship. • Avoid confrontation with employees. A supervisor may feel uncomfortable provid- ing negative feedback and, in order to avoid a possible confrontation with the employee, may decide to take the path of least resistance and give inflated performance ratings.

- Promote undesired employees out of unit. A supervisor may believe that if an employee receives very high ratings she may be promoted out of the unit. The supervisor may regard this as an effective way to get rid of undesirable employees. • Make the manager look good to his/her supervisor. A supervisor may believe that if everyone receives very high performance ratings, the supervisor will be consid- ered an effective unit leader. Moreover, when the performance ratings for the manager himself depend on the performance of his subordinates, managers are likely to inflate their subordinates’ ratings.39

We can understand each of the reasons for a supervisor’s choosing to inflate ratings using a model or rater motivation. For example, looking good in the eyes of one’s own supervisor can be regarded as a positive consequence of providing inflated ratings. Avoiding a possible confrontation with an employee can also be regarded as a positive consequence of providing inflated ratings. Thus, given these anticipated posi- tive consequences of rating inflation, the supervisor may choose to provide distorted ratings.

Supervisors may also be motivated to provide ratings that are artificially deflated.

Some reasons for this are to

- Shock an employee. A supervisor may believe that giving an employee a “shock treatment” and providing deflated performance ratings will jolt the employee, demonstrating that there is a problem.

- Teach a rebellious employee a lesson. Asupervisor may wish to punish an employee or force an employee to cooperate with the supervisor and believes that the best way to do this is to give deflated performance ratings.
