A popular and comprehensible technique for predicting staff attrition is LR. This algorithm provides insights into the likelihood and variables driving attrition by modeling the chance of an employee leaving depending on input features. When it is assumed that there is a linear relationship between the predictors and the binary result of attrition, LR is more successful. (Tharani and Raj., 2020) [19, 20] It is appropriate for situations when comprehending the significance of every aspect is essential since it is straightforward and simple to interpret. In the area of employee attrition prediction, logistic regression is a useful tool due to its clarity, computing efficiency, and applicability to datasets with a reasonable amount of features, even though it may not capture complex non-linear correlations as well as some other methods. Regularization methods and feature selection should be carefully considered as the model's generalization capabilities.
