## Conﬂict Resolution (MD-ICCCR) at Columbia University Teacher’s

College, we lead research that promotes conﬂict resolution and helps

people work through diﬃcult problems. Ten years ago, at the request of

the U.N., we undertook a review of empirical studies about mediation.

Through that work, we identiﬁed four primary reasons why mediation

can fail.

As a leader, before you step in to resolve a diﬃcult conﬂict like the one

above, it can be helpful to know the problems that often arise — where

your good intentions might go awry — so you can avoid them. First,

we’ll share the four chief reasons mediations get derailed, and then we’ll

highlight strategies you can implement to avert them.
