# Lead with empathy

Your delivery should be direct and steady, yet your tone should be

compassionate, says Karamanis. “The key is to lead with empathy,

transparency, and authenticity.” Don’t gather people just to go through

the motions. “Employees crave reassurance and authentic presence,”

she adds. “People can tell when a town hall is just for show.” DeChurch

recommends being explicit about both the emotional weight and the

business reality of recent decisions. “Name the harm: You have to say it

and show that you understand what people are going through,” she says.

Spell out what policy and economic changes mean for your business,

then focus on how it will impact your team and the work ahead. “Talk

about the continued uncertainty,” she says. “People process disruption

emotionally before they can think through it logically. If you don’t

acknowledge what happened and why they won’t be able to move

forward with you.”

Clarify the path forward

Acknowledging diﬃculty doesn’t mean wallowing in negativity, says

DeChurch. Once you’ve said the hard part out loud, “help your team

channel their fears into productive action” by projecting “a positive

vision for the future.” She suggests gently guiding people toward

next steps by saying something like: “Our goal is to thrive and keep

making the best widgets in the world. Right now, doing that is more

complex because of these external factors. But there are opportunities

for organizations that ﬁgure out how to be resilient and adapt. Let’s

be one of them.” Your goal is to reframe the situation and help others
