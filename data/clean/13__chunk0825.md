However, if one is truly interested in the social nature of humor in communication, it is essential that one understands how humor producers infuse humor in their communications, and subsequently, how those presumably humorous communications are interpreted or ‘‘appreciated’’ by the audience. The examination of this issue requires an understanding of the cognitive processes involved in distinguishing humorous communications from non- humorous communications; what makes something ‘‘funny’’?

Incongruity theory has roots in philosophy, and has been the most popular mechanism for explaining how humor works for many decades (e.g., Hazlitt, 1930).
