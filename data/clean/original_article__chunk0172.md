Team dynamics TIQ appears to be the ‘intervening process’ identiﬁed by F&M (1999), however not in the manner we expected. It does not translate the director characteristics and individual behaviors to board-level outcomes of TTP and TP, but it is critical in the model in predicting TTP and TP. TIQ is a signiﬁcant and powerful antece- dent to board-level outcomes. F&M (1999) identiﬁed that there is an ‘intervening process’ at the board level that drives board- and ﬁrm-

(F&M, 1999). Others have level outcomes referred to this as the board’s dynamic (Leblanc and Gillies, 2003; Letendre, 2004; Huse et al, 2005; Leblanc and Schwartz, 2007; Huse et al, 2011). TIQ is the heart of our model, and the critical ‘intervening process’ that determines the success or failure of the board as a team, and therefore their ability to generate measurable proﬁtability enhancement, demonstrated by the relationship TIQ has with TTP (0.77, P<0.01), TP (0.66, P<0.01) and directly
