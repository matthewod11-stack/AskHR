## Wage and Hour Division oﬃce and in 29 CFR Part 570.

By regulation, employers must keep records of the dates of birth of employees under age 19, their daily

starting and quitting times, their daily and weekly hours of work, and their occupations. The FLSA provides that an employer that has on ﬁle an oﬃcially-issued employment or age certiﬁcate showing that the minor is

the minimum age required by the FLSA is not liable for violating the child labor provisions if that

documentation proves to be incorrect. Age or employment certiﬁcates issued under most state laws are

generally acceptable for this purpose. See 29 CFR 570.5.
