# its area.

This specialization makes the entire system more efficient. When an agent handles a

narrower set of tasks, it becomes simpler to optimize its performance. The result is higher

quality responses delivered more quickly and at lower computational cost. Performance

improves because the system can match the right resources to each task. Simple requests

use minimal processing power, while complex questions tap into more powerful resources

only when needed.

Speed matters in a vehicle, and multi-agent systems deliver where it counts. Critical

functions like adjusting climate controls or opening windows run on fast, on-device

agents for immediate response. Meanwhile, less urgent tasks like finding restaurant
