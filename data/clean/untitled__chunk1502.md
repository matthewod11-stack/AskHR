# 256 Psychology of Women and Gender

of the methods but of the methods themselves. Psychology, some feminist critics have charged, overrelies on laboratory experimentation, which strips away social context (Parlee, 1979). Some feminists have pointed out that psychology has a long but hidden tradition of inquiry that goes beyond labo- ratory experimentation (Marecek, Fine, & Kidder, 1997). Field research, observational techniques, content analysis, participant-observation, focus groups, and case studies are a few examples. A growing number of feminist researchers use these approaches as well as new modes of inquiry, such as discourse analysis, that draw on postmodern thought. The call for methodological pluralism has had some ef- fects, at least in some feminist circles. Feminism and Psy- chology, published in the United Kingdom and intended for an international readership, routinely publishes work using innovative approaches. Special issues of Psychology of Women Quarterly in 1989 and 1999 have focused on innova- tive methods and theory.
