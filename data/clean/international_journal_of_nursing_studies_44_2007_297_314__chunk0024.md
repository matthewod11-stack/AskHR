The aim of this review was to explore the impact of job satisfaction components on intent to leave and turnover for hospital-based nurses. In order to extract relevant research from the published literature to achieve this aim the electronic databases Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CI- NAHL 1982–2004), Psychology Information (PsycIN- FO 2000–2004) and British Nursing Index (BNI 1985–2004) were searched. Keywords were ‘nurses’, ‘retention’ and ‘job satisfaction’ with synonyms and phrases being used as appropriate (for example, the term retention was used and combined with attrition, intent to leave, intent to quit, propensity to leave, intent to stay and turnover). The years 1997–2004 were chosen as a limit option in order to select only recent published work
