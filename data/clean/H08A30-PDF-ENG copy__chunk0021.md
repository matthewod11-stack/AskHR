# inclusion in his life

- Testimonials about the workplace from two disabled employees

- Statistics on the hiring, promotion, accommodation fulﬁllment, and

retention of disabled employees, along with awards recognizing the

company’s accomplishments in the DEI space

Our results show that disabled people responded positively to the

websites that included more concrete details about the company’s

commitment and actions. It didn’t even seem to matter whether

the addition was a CEO’s message, employee testimonials, or the

presentation of awards and statistics. Each of these helped bolster

conﬁdence in the company and increased our participants’ willingness

to apply for a job there.

However, when it came to evaluating trust in the company, the

presentation of statistics and awards didn’t do the job by itself — it took

the addition of some kind of personal language from either the CEO or

current employees through testimonials to be convincing.
