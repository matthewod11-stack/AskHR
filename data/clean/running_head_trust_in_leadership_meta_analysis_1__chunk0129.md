An ancillary aim of the current research was to estimate the relative effects of ethical,

authentic, servant, and abusive leadership. As discussed, the leadership literature has been

critiqued for construct redundancy, with high correlations being observed between

supposedly distinct leadership styles (e.g., Banks et al., 2018). One way to address this issue

Our findings have important implications for the leadership field. On the one hand,
