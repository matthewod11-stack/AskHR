# 3.2. The Gender Equality Barometer

In Finland, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health is in charge of gender equality. The Ministry prepares legislation, monitors the situation of gender equality nationwide, coordinates the development of activities on gender equality, and promotes the implementation of the objectives of the government's equality policy5. Since 1998, every four years the Ministry, together with Statistics Finland, has conducted and published the Equality Barometer. A Barometer observes the state of gender equality in Finland and examines men’s and women’s opinions and attitudes concerning it.

One of the main aims of the thesis is to examine how individuals with different backgrounds and employees from different workplaces perceive gender inequality. More specifically, some of the objectives of the thesis are to analyze whether, and to what extent, individuals and employees perceive gender inequality to exist in their own workplaces and in society, and to identify factors that explain individuals’ and employees’ perceptions of gender inequality in their own workplace and in society. The Finnish Gender Equality Barometer thus perfectly matches the above-mentioned aims and objectives of the thesis.

I was granted an opportunity to use the data of the Finnish Gender Equality Barometer 2008 (2008 Barometer6) for the purpose of conducting my doctoral dissertation and publishing articles in academic journals. The description of this data set and the summary of the previous Barometers are presented below.

A key perspective in all the Barometers is the examination of changes that have taken place during the past decade in Finland (Nieminen, 2009). Based on the summary of the Barometers (Nieminen, 2009), I would like to highlight the following result of the Barometers among others:

- Neither women nor men view the position of women and women in society as equal.

- While the majority of wage and salary earners find that gender equality at work is realized well or fairly well, women still experience their gender as much more of a disadvantage at work than men do (mostly visible in questions related to pay, recognition of professional skill, and career advancement).

Increased experience of gender related disadvantages at work and increased sexual harassment among highly educated women.

The father’s role in the family has strengthened.

- Both women and men feel they can influence decisions made within their family.
