the major contribution perceived by employees from the employer is organizational support (Zagenczyk et al., 2010). The supportive organization acknowledges the contribution of their employees toward achievement of organizational objectives which result in increased enthusiasm, creativity and innovation, and adoption of latest knowledge. This supportive environment increases the employees’ level of thriving at work (Wiesenfeld et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2016). Moreover, as a coach, manager provides the timely feedback to the subordinates, provide clear expectations regarding goal achievement, act as a role model for the employees, create learning environment, to improve the employees in the role as well as extra role performance to enhance the organizational effectiveness (Colquitt et al., 2007).

The review of the literature showed that in-role performance of employees’ is positively influenced by the thriving (Porath et al., 2012). A study of public sector university shown that employees having a high score on the thriving at work had a high level of job performance (Porath et al., 2012). One more study of six different organizations shown results similar to other studies which resulted that 125 % employees shown less burnout, 46 % were satisfied, and 32 percent were committed to the organization. The employees with high thriving at work had more opportunities to learn, grow, develop and perform within the organizations (Porath et al., 2012).

Porath et al. (2012) revealed in a comparative study of executives that thrived leaders are more effective in the organization as compared to the non-thriving leader. Thriving at work grows the perception about leaders as a role model for the subordinates and care taker of their well-being. They also become the reason for thriving at work among the subordinates as well. Thriving at work is also a reason for developing good working relationship with other organizational members and promote the well-being of the colleagues (Spreitzer et al., 2005; Abid et al., 2015) as a result of addressing their issues in the workplace and encourage their behaviors like organizational citizenship behavior.

If the structure and mechanism understood the relationship of managerial coaching behavior and organizational outcome, then the application of managerial coaching may be more effective in an organization. So, this effect can be done by applying mediating role in the relationship between managerial coaching behaviors and organizational outcome to understand the mechanism. Thus, in this study thriving at work tries to arouse employees’ abilities fully, in return employees behave optimistic attitude (Kwon, 2015) and positive views (Yang et al., 2015) towards their goals and duties. Then, they gain a sense of organizational commitment and belongings and feel thrive in their workplace, which enhances performance, OCB-I, and OCB-O, which they would perform beyond their job scope regardless of any advantage just for the sake of their organization.

So, it can be hypothesized that the association among managerial coaching and employee in a role and extra role behaviors are mediated by the thriving at work. (cid:32) H4: The relationship of managerial coaching and employee in-role performance will

be mediated by thriving at work.

(cid:32) H5: The relationship of managerial coaching and employee OCBI will be mediated

by thriving at work.

(cid:32) H6: The relationship of managerial coaching and employee OCBO will be mediated

by thriving at work.
