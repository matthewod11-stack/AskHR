# YOUTH LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY

Leadership is a highly valued construct, but it is not always easily deﬁned or understood. Over time, we at ISYS have developed a leadership philos- ophy that serves as a foundation for all of our outreach work in this area. This philosophy is based on the latest leadership research conducted with adults (Anderson, 2007), youth leadership research and theory (Martinek & Hellison, 2009; van Linden & Fertman, 1998), our own research on youth sport leadership (Voelker, Gould, & Crawford, 2010; Voelker, Gould, & Griffes, 2010; Voelker et al., 2010), and our staff’s ﬁve years of experience in conducting CLTP. The fundamental principles of this youth leadership development philosophy follow:

- 1. Leadership is a complex process that involves the effort of an individual (i.e., a leader) to help groups identify and achieve personal and group goals.
