what the person has done or what has happened); feeling (how it aﬀects

you); and consequences (what the result was). For example, you might

say, “When you dismissed my proposal immediately, I felt frustrated, because it seems like you don’t value what I have to oﬀer.” While

such messages aren’t confrontational, they do ﬂag misalignments and

potential negotiation derailers that will need focus, attention, and care.

Effective pauses give your counterparts space to collect their thoughts,

keep talking, or even vent in ways that can be informative for you.

All you need to do is refrain from responding after they seem to have

ﬁnished speaking until the pause begins to feel slightly uncomfortable,

and then hold it for a few seconds more. I’ve seen this used to great eﬀect when police oﬃcers interview suspects, witnesses, or victims,

because most people feel compelled to ﬁll the silence. Inexperienced

communicators often ﬁnd themselves jumping in. If you are one, try to

resist. To this day I keep a stress ball with the letters W.A.I.T. on my

desk; it stands for both “wait” and “Why am I talking?”

Summarizing, like paraphrasing, involves oﬀering your understanding of what someone has just said, but the diﬀerence is that you repeat

that person’s words rather than using your own, to help them see

their argument more clearly and build trust. This technique is best

used when your counterpart has delivered a lot of information or a

long, rambling narrative. You’re adding value by condensing it into a

manageable chunk and highlighting the key points. For example, to

the boss resisting your plea to expand your team, you might say, “If I

understand you correctly, you don’t have the budget in this ﬁscal year,

but a small personnel allocation might open up in the next cycle. So I

should write you a memo proposing a job description for a potential new

hire. Is that a fair summary?” This gives the boss a chance to correct
