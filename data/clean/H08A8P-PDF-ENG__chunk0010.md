# outside of it.

Mention any positive outcomes or successes, even if they’re early. For

example, “We’ve just started X, and already we’re seeing Y result,” subtly

implies that you’re on the right track and not looking for alternatives.

If relevant, highlight that you have support or approval from key

stakeholders; for example, “I’ve discussed this with [manager/leader],

and they’re on board with moving ahead.”

Combine a compliment with a boundary.

To politely regain control over a conversation, signal that while you

value someone’s input, you’re not currently looking for other ideas. This

strategy is particularly useful in meetings where time is limited and you

need to focus on speciﬁc agenda items.
