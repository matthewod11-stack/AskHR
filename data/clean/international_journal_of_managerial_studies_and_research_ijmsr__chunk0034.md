## Vroomâ€™s Expectancy Theory Brought Quantitative into Motivation Theory.

It brought together many of the elements of the previous theories. It combines perceptual aspects of equity theory with the behavioral aspects of the other theories; it gives the equation

M = E x I x V Where: M = MOTIVATION E = EXPECTANCY I = INSTRUMENTALITY V = VALENCE

This shows that motivational force is related to expectancy, instrumentality and valence in a multiplicative manner. The summary is that people tend to sustain behaviour that results in the satisfaction of their needs. 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK The theoretical framework adopted for this work is the Political System Theory. Eckstrand (1964) which we have specifically adopted for this research project: will briefly explain on a general plane what systems theory or approach is all about.

System approach for analyzing social and organization phenomena was introduced by Easton (1953). Easton wished to construct an empirically oriented general theory of politics. Although the system approach was first developed in the biological and engineering sciences. David Easton adopted it and sought to define the kind of function characteristics of any political system through a systematic framework for political analysis. He examined the basic processes through which a political system regardless of its genetic or specific type is able to persist as a system of behavior in a world either of stability or of change.
