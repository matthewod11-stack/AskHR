I’ve recently been working with a large consulting company that is

conducting such a test. The model is instructive. The company decided

to implement a signiﬁcant technological change in the way it operated

— a change that would require senior employees to invest time in

learning new technology and drastically alter their working methods.

Some of these employees were enthusiastic about the opportunity, and

others were not, but management couldn’t distinguish between them.

Company leaders recognized that they needed to ﬁgure that out in one

particularly important context — when they were considering which

employees to name as partners. Why? Because when the company

chooses who to promote, it is declaring them highly competent

and valuable, which immediately makes them interesting to other

companies, who often begin eﬀorts to lure them away. The company

wants to avoid a situation in which it trains employees and promote

them to partner at the expense of others, only to see those partners take

their knowledge and training and go elsewhere. In addition, it’s hard

to ﬁre partners even if they don’t do a good job or embrace necessary

changes in how work gets done. That’s why the company wanted to

ﬁgure out which employees were the most motivated before it decided

which of them to name as partners. If the company could do that, it

could then make its investments in training much more strategically
