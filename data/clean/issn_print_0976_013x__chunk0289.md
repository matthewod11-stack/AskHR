Despite the advances in research angles of lean, agile, resilient, sustainable, and flexible, the

search for a versatile integral actor which incorporates and guides research implications from

different research aspects has been identified as reconfiguration (Dolgui et al., 2020), with its

origin in robotics dealing with the restructuring of modules in space. Reconfiguration has

been argued, as the extension of flexible manufacturing aspects emphasizing the aid of self-

adjustments and adaptability, for rapid response to changes in a cost-effective manner for

companies (Koren et al., 1999).

Traditional literature studies suggest reconfigurability in terms of changeability for quick and
