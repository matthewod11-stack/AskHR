# cost-efficient addition/removal of resources or products at the equipment, production, and

system level, which now has been extended at the supply chain level for design under cost-

efficient, responsive, resilient, sustainable manner and can be considered as the prime concept

to incorporate viability (Ivanov, 2020). Modularity, integrability, convertibility, scalability,

diagnosability and mass customization are the key characteristics of reconfiguration and

employing these characteristics, the decision and evaluation of the supply chain capacity to

adapt to changes can be performed (Biswas et al., 2019; Zidi et al., 2021a; Zidi et al., 2021b).
