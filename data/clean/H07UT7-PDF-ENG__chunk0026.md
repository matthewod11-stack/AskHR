## HBR / Digital Article / Research: The Benefits of a Pet-Friendly Workplace

conﬁdential advice from both those who favor and those who oppose

oﬃce pets have been posted to askamanager.com for years. One study

sought to understand what to do about this tension by analyzing ﬁve

organizations that had instituted dog-friendly policies within three

months to 20 years ago. They found that harmonious co-existence, as

well as acceptance by those who would prefer the oﬃce remain pet

free, is diﬃcult but possible when three criteria are met. Employees

must have suﬃcient job autonomy; for example, the agency to take

their dog out when it needs a break or to distance themselves from a

bothersome pet. There must also be a culture of open and respectful communication, so no one suﬀers in silence. Finally, employees must

all buy into a “trial-and-error mentality” and be willing to update any

agreements as needed.
