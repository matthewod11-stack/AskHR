# All 3 foundational practices

1 Respondents who said (a) that their organizations make high-quality decisions, (b) that their organizations make and execute decisions quickly, and (c) that their

organizations see higher growth rates and/or overall returns from their decisions.

be part of a winning company. This result is closely related to another finding: both high-quality decisions and quick ones are much more common at organizations with fewer reporting layers.10

- 2. Focus relentlessly on enterprise-level value. It might seem intuitive, but only 41 percent of respondents say their organizations’ decisions align with the corporate strategy and that they allocate human and financial resources toward high-value projects. Those that do focus on enterprise-level value in this way are much more likely (2.9 times) than others to be a winner.

- 3. Get commitment from the relevant stakeholders. The winning organizations also build commitment to executing decisions once they are made, especially among the people who are ultimately accountable for a given decision. When respon- dents say their companies are committed to execution—which requires that accountable stakeholders know the decision process was robust and that these people were involved in a meaningful way—they are 6.8 times more likely to be at winning companies. While fostering commitment can mean involving more people and getting more buy-in, that doesn’t mean com- panies have to compromise on speed. Neither

10 Overall, 70 percent of respondents at organizations with one to three reporting layers agree that their companies make high-quality

decisions, compared with 53 percent at organizations with four to six layers and 45 percent of those with seven or more. Similarly, 61 percent of respondents at organizations with one to three layers agree that their companies make decisions quickly, compared with 47 percent at organizations with four to six layers and 38 percent at organizations with seven or more.

Decision making in the age of urgency

of those actions necessarily requires giving everyone a vote or requiring unanimous agree- ment, which could slow a decision.

Beyond the foundational practices, the winners also demonstrate best practices that are specific to each decision type (Exhibit 6):

of the senior-executive committee to play devil’s advocate and present counterarguments to the group. When respondents say their compa- nies do all three, they are 2.3 times more likely to be winners. The results also show that, while speed is important for decision making, quickly committing to big-bet decisions without reaching consensus among leaders does not beget success.

— For big bets, the most significant predictor of successful decision making is the quality of discussions and debate. Ensuring high-quality debate when making a big-bet decision involves three things: that decision makers explore assumptions and alternatives beyond the given information, that they actively seek information that would disconfirm their initial hypotheses, and that they designate one more or more members
