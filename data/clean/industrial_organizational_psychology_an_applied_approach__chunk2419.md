## Are Employees’ Job Expectations Being Met?

As was discussed in Chapter , employees come to a job with certain needs, val- ues, and expectations. If there is a discrepancy between these needs, values, and expectations and the reality of the job, employees will become dissatisfied and less motivated. In a test of this discrepancy theory, a meta-analysis by Wanous, Poland, Premack, and Davis () concluded that when an employee’s expectations are not met, the results are lower job satisfaction (r = −.), decreased organiza- tional commitment (r = −.), and an increased intent to leave the organization (r = .). These results support the importance of ensuring that applicants have realistic job expectations. Though the meta-analysis results supported the “met expectations” theory, Irving and Meyer () criticized the studies that were included in the meta-analysis. In their own study, Irving and Meyer found that an employee’s experiences on the job were most related to job satisfaction and that the difference between their expectations and experiences was only minimally related to job satisfaction. More studies using methods similar to Irving and Mey- er’s are needed to clarify this issue.

In a related meta-analysis, Zhao, Wayne, Glibkowski, and Bravo () inves- tigated the effect of employees perceiving that an organization has not fulfilled its promises and obligations (called psychological contracts) to an employee. When such psychological contract breaches occur, job satisfaction and organizational commitment go down and employee intentions to leave the organization increase. The results of these two meta-analyses support the importance of ensuring not only that applicants have realistic job expectations but that any promises made to employees must be kept.

Is the Employee a Good Fit with the Job and the Organization?

When employees consider how well they “fit” with a job or an organization, they consider the extent to which their values, interests, personality, lifestyle, and skills match those of their vocation (e.g., a career such as nursing, law enforcement, or psychology), job (its particular tasks), organization, coworkers, and supervisor (Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, & Johnson, ). In addition to these five aspects of fit, Cable and DeRue () believe that needs/supplies fit is also important. Needs/supplies fit is the extent to which the rewards, salary, and benefits received by employees are perceived to be consistent with their efforts and performance.

As shown in Table ., the meta-analysis by Kristof-Brown et al. () clearly demonstrates the importance of fit. Employees who perceive a good fit with their organization, job, coworkers, and supervisor tend to be satisfied with their jobs, identify with the organization, remain with the organization, perform better, and engage in organizational citizenship behaviors.

Another “fit” factor that has been shown to be related to job satisfaction and commitment is the extent to which employees’ desire for a particular work schedule (e.g., shift, number of hours) matches their actual schedule. As one would expect, the better the fit between an employee’s desired schedule and his actual schedule, the greater an employee’s job satisfaction, organizational com- mitment, performance, and likelihood to remain with the organization (Holtom, Lee, & Tidd, ).

Branham () believes that there are certain signs to which an organiza- tion should pay attention that indicate a job/person mismatch. Some of these signs are that the employee
