Gender pay gap: The gender pay gap is also known as the “gender wage gap”, the “gender gap in earnings”, or “male-female income disparity”. In this thesis, it refers to the difference in average hourly earnings of male and female employees after controlling for human capital factors such as education and tenure (adapted from various papers of Blau and Kahn; see, for instance, Blau and Kahn, 2006).

Perception: perception is ‘the process by which people select, organize, interpret, retrieve, and respond to information from the world around them’ (Schermerhorn, Hunt, Osborn, and Uhl-Bien, 2010: 84). In this thesis, I attempt to analyze individuals’ and employees’ perceptions of gender inequality and the gender pay gap. To do so, I investigate whether and to what extent individuals and employees perceive overall, societal, and workplace gender inequality to exist.

Pay in/equity. The concept of equity implies that one receives proportionally fair outcomes in return for what one invests in a relationship or situation, when comparisons are made with similar others (Adams, 1965). Pay equity, in turn, deals with whether the pay is fair, and if it corresponds to what others with the same competencies get (Blau and Kahn, 2000). Therefore, in this thesis, the term ‘pay inequity’ refers to a particular mean for measuring unfairness of pay among men and women.
