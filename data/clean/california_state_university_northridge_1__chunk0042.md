## An Introduction to the Practice of Wrongful Termination in the Workplace

The basis of this project is case law and interpretations that have been given by

judges and lawyers who have first hand knowledge or have written on the subject of

wrongful termination. At the start of this research it is this author's intention to show that

wrongful termination is the direct result of managers who have not been adequately

trained in employment law and or required business procedures. It is this study objective

to determine if this is a true statement to make or not. If this is not the case, after

reviewing all the information presented, it shall be determined why employers are being

taken to court and losing cases for wrongful discharge, and what are the actual problems.

It should be kept in mind that a preponderance of the workforce is at-will employees.

Clarification and identification is needed on a few terms and phrases used, which

can be found hi the legal definitions provided after the chapter six. In addition, the pruase

agent of the employer from here on out shall refer to a single business owner (a sole

proprietorsl-i.ip), partnerslijp, corporation, and or any person(s) v1ithin their business

function, listed as a president, vice president, corporate executive, manager a.11d or

supervisor that has the capacity to directly or indirectly execute a termination of a

subordinate. One must keep in mind, some suits are from those who were in management

and were terminated by their superiors.
