## oﬀer clear instrumental beneﬁts or strategic rewards, like that of an

independent consultant hoping to secure a deal with a key client.

Others oﬀer intrinsic beneﬁts, like the camaraderie and validation you

receive from working together. Professionals in places like Germany

may prefer to keep these two purposes separate: You wouldn’t

necessarily expect to become chummy with your work colleague here,

and it could feel like an intrusion or violation to do so. Yet in other

cultures, like Brazil, workplace relationships are cherished for their

own sake and colleagues often become friends who make a habit of

meeting up on the weekends for fun. And in some places, like the U.S.,

we see a blend: People enjoy building a personal connection, but more

to motivate the team, function eﬀectively, and get the job done faster.

These notions about purpose are linked to diﬀering interpretations

of “professionalism.” If we don’t pay attention to this, we can easily

feel annoyed, disillusioned, confused, or judgmental when a colleague

deviates from what we’re expecting.
