Employers usually have the at~will employment verbiage in the application and not

within the handbook. A person looking for a job completes several applications, but only

can accept one offer. Once hired, he or she is given the employee handbook, which

obtain information on a variety of issues that a company chooses to disseminate and what

is employee finds interesting. A new hire may read that he or she could only be fired for

suspension then termination. These are the key elements to progressive discipline; all

components may not be used by every business. A termination based on progressive

disciplinary action does not have to follow this sequence, and not following that order may

constitute wrongful discharged. However, it is the absence that based on the infraction

any portion of this process can be omitted. This well constructed process without any

disclaimer constitutes the basis for reasonable expectation in the mind of the employee in

which termination would occur, and how discipline will be administered. The employee

handbook may be read several times by employees based on upon their particular

situation. And if the employee performance is bad, he or she may read about the action

their supervisor, may take based on their performance. Again, the handbook has formed

the basis of a reasonable expectation between employer and employee that any action

outside of the handbook or not comply1-ng with a sequential order may be viewed as a

violation. A perceived violation by the employee can end up in court and or viewed as a
