## HBR / Digital Article / How Biases About Motherhood Impact All Women at Work

analyzes salaries based on demographic data including gender, race,

and parental status. This will help to ensure that men are not making

more due to family considerations. If you discover inequities, correct

them immediately. Rerun the pay analysis annually to identify and ﬁx

any inequities that have crept in.

Encourage men to demonstrate caregiving

We know that paid parental leave is helpful to parents and especially

mothers. By also requiring fathers to take the leave, organizations

can dispel perceptions that only women will eventually need it. As

we have shown, women face discrimination due to both motherhood

and potential motherhood. Mandating that men use parental leave

neutralizes stigmas associated with caregiving, thus reducing workplace

bias against women. Men should also be encouraged to take family

sick leave and be vocal about their needs to leave early for caregiving.

Having men demonstrate their role in caregiving will help combat

notions that hiring or promoting women presents a risk to the company.

Eliminating the maternal wall against nonmothers and mothers alike

is entirely possible. Make the eﬀort and you will reap the results of an

engaged workforce.
