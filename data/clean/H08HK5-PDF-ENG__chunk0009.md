## HBR / Digital Article / When Expressing Gratitude to Employees, Timing Matters

In the second study we gave 330 new subjects solvable but diﬃcult

geometric puzzles and tested the eﬀects of other positive sentiments,

like hope. Expressing gratitude in advance, we found, was signiﬁcantly associated with social worth, while hope in advance of the diﬃcult task

was unrelated to social worth. Oﬀering gratitude in advance, unlike

other mechanisms we tested, helped counteract the negative emotions

caused by challenging tasks by increasing participants’ feelings of social

worth. Increasing people’s sense of social impact, for example, did not

have this emotionally regulating eﬀect.
