## Deepening the Study of Cognitive Development

As part of the current vigorous study of cognitive develop- ment, researchers have returned to issues of consciousness, reﬂection, intention, motivation, and will (Flavell, 1999). There has been a reemergence of interest in the interplay between conscious and unconscious processes, an indi- cation of a willingness to tackle problems that preoc- cupied our ﬁeld’s founders but were set aside for nearly a century. Several investigators (Greenwald, 1992; Kihlstrom, Barnhardt, & Tataryn, 1992) have developed methods that

permit examination of the impact of unconscious processes on a variety of cognitive and perceptual processes and allow methodologically defensible excursions into such classic clinical issues as repression and self-deception. These meth- ods could be adapted usefully for developmental studies and would provide interesting approaches to a range of current is- sues, from eyewitness testimony to early affective memories. In turn, such applications would have important implica- tions for an understanding of effects of early experience and attachment.

There is also a strong interest in the interplay between cognition and emotion, as reﬂected in the activity surround- ing children’s understanding of emotion (Harris, 1989; Saarni, 1999). Most recently, the range of emotions under in- vestigation has expanded to include self-conscious emotions such as shame, guilt, pride, empathy, and envy, topics that were anticipated by Freud and others but were of little inter- est for many years (Denham, 1998; Eisenberg, 1991; Lewis, 1992).
