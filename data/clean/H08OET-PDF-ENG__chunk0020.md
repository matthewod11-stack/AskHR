# just a ﬁve percentage point drop.

Credentials don’t have offsetting effects.

Extra credentials can make you stand out. For example, those with

degrees from prestigious programs or who have MBAs are seen

as bringing something extra, and these qualiﬁcations are generally

associated with higher pay.

We suspected that such credentials might have a dampening eﬀect on

those with resume gaps, but our ﬁndings don’t support this. MBAs with

a resume gap suﬀered a ﬁve percentage point drop in average salary

compared to MBAs without gaps, similar to the broader population.

Having an Ivy League degree did not help, either.
