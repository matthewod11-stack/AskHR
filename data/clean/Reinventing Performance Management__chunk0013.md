## THE BIG IDEA REINVENTING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

At Deloitte we’re redesigning our performance management system. This may not surprise you. Like many other companies, we realize that our current process for evaluating the work of our people—and then training them, promoting them, and paying them accordingly—is increasingly out of step with our objectives.

In a public survey Deloitte conducted recently, more than half the executives questioned (58%) be- lieve that their current performance management approach drives neither employee engagement nor high performance. They, and we, are in need of something nimbler, real-time, and more individual- ized—something squarely focused on fueling per- formance in the future rather than assessing it in the past.

What might surprise you, however, is what we’ll include in Deloitte’s new system and what we won’t. It will have no cascading objectives, no once-a-year reviews, and no 360-degree-feedback tools. We’ve arrived at a very different and much simpler design for managing people’s performance. Its hallmarks are speed, agility, one-size-fits-one, and constant learning, and it’s underpinned by a new way of col- lecting reliable performance data. This system will make much more sense for our talent-dependent business. But we might never have arrived at its de- sign without drawing on three pieces of evidence: a simple counting of hours, a review of research in the

science of ratings, and a carefully controlled study of our own organization.

Counting and the Case for Change More than likely, the performance management system Deloitte has been using has some charac- teristics in common with yours. Objectives are set for each of our 65,000-plus people at the beginning of the year; after a project is finished, each person’s manager rates him or her on how well those objec- tives were met. The manager also comments on where the person did or didn’t excel. These evalu- ations are factored into a single year-end rating, ar- rived at in lengthy “consensus meetings” at which groups of “counselors” discuss hundreds of people in light of their peers.

Internal feedback demonstrates that our people like the predictability of this process and the fact that because each person is assigned a counselor, he or she has a representative at the consensus meetings. The vast majority of our people believe the process is
