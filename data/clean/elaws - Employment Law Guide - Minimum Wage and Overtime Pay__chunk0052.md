Every employer who employs workers with disabilities under special minimum wage certiÔ¨Åcates is also

required to post the Employee Rights for Workers with Disabilities/Special Minimum Wage Poster(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters/section-14c).

Every employer covered by the FLSA must keep certain records for each of its covered employees. Employers

must keep records on wages, hours, and other information as set forth in the Department of Labor's regulations. Most of this data is the type that employers generally maintain in ordinary business practice.

There is no required form for the records. However, the records must include accurate information about the

employee and data about the hours worked and the wages earned. The following is a listing of the basic

payroll records that an employer must maintain:

Employee's full name, as used for Social Security purposes, and on the same record, the employee's

identifying symbol or number if such is used in place of name on any time, work, or payroll records
