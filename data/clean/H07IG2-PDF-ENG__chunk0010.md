## as robotic process automation (RPA) help to structure the ﬂow of work

and automate information-intensive back-oﬃce processes. RPA is rule-

based, which limits its ability to employ data-based decisions. But

combined with machine learning as “intelligent process automation,”

it can deal with much a greater variation of tasks.

This AI-driven reengineering is already taking place. Banks are using

it to transform wealth management advice for clients. Insurance

companies are using AI to make client onboarding and underwriting

much easier, and automating claims estimates for auto and home

damage with deep learning analysis of photos taken by the insured.

Industrial ﬁrms are reshaping maintenance and engineering processes.

Even in health care, where there is considerable research on AI

but much less clinical adoption, diagnosis and treatment are being

reshaped by AI-based telemedicine in some countries.

All of this has important ramiﬁcations for the way we use AI, how work

is being performed, and how companies are being organized. To take

advantage of these potential beneﬁts, companies need to bring back an

end-to-end process perspective on their businesses, and think carefully

about how AI can transform them. In essence, companies need to

explore where they are generating suﬃcient data to extract patterns that

could be used to support operational decisions.
