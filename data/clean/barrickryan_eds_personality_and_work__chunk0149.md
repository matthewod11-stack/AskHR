# THE HAPPY WORKER 33

It is also likely that there are additional traits and dispositions related to affective and cognitive well-being and with implications for productivity. For example, Judge and his colleagues (Judge, Erez, & Bono, 1998; Judge et al., 1997) argued that a set of self- concept personality variables (which they call core self-evaluations) is important for worker productivity. Speciﬁcally, they noted that self-esteem, generalized self-efﬁcacy, locus of control, and neu- roticism are important predictors of performance. Many of these variables are conceptually related to happiness and exhibit mod- erate to strong correlations with well-being measures (Lucas et al., 1996). Although there is conceptual overlap, these traits may af- fect performance and productivity through different mechanisms than do affect and satisfaction. For this reason, we restrict the focus of this chapter to affect and well-being and only occasionally dis- cuss ﬁndings from this related literature.
