this chapter and the expertise of these authors. Our focus in this brief section is on the history of the scientiﬁc study of the mind, which really began in the nineteenth century.

Perhaps the ﬁrst experimental attacks on the nature of the mind were the observations of Weber as generalized by Gustav Fechner. Ernst Weber, a physiologist, was attempting in 1834 to determine whether the nerves that respond to the state of the muscles also contribute to judgments about weights. He found that the just noticeable difference (jnd) in weight that could be reliably detected by the observer was not some absolute amount but rather a constant ratio of the weight being lifted. The same applied to the pitch of tones and the length of lines.

Fechner realized that Weber had discovered a way of measuring the properties of the mind. Indeed, in his Elements of Psychophysics (1860/1966) he felt he had solved the prob- lem of mind and body. He generalized Weber’s observations to state that as the psychological measurement in jnd’s in- creased arithmetically, the intensity of the physical stimulus increased geometrically—the relationship is logarithmic. Fechner, trained as a physicist, developed the classical psy- chophysical methods and the concepts of absolute and differ- ential thresholds. According to Edwin Boring (1942), he had a nervous breakdown and resigned his chair at Leipzig in 1839. During the last 35 years of his life, he devoted himself to panpsychism, the view that mind and matter are one and thus that mind is all. He viewed the psychophysical law as the paradigm for the transformation of the material into the spir- itual. In any event, the methods Fechner developed were of great help to such early experimental psychologists as Wundt
