# Discussion and implications

The primary question that we have addressed in this study is why firms persist with

underperforming workers. Drawing on insights from two emerging economies in Africa:

Ghana and Nigeria, we uncovered that persistence with underperforming workers stems from

factors such as information hoarding, favouritism through tribalism, “idiosyncrasy credit”,

externally imposed constraints and escalation of commitment. Interestingly, we have

uncovered evidence to advance the notion that ethnic ties and tribalism play an influential

role in the decision by managers to persist with underperforming workers. Another broad

category of sources of persistence stems from the emotional bond created between

supervisors and subordinates. The existence of such ties constrained managers’ ability to act

in the face of persistent poor performance. It also stems from firms’ attempt to gain and retain

24

political ties and “special privileges”. In addition, we uncovered that outside the work

environment, some of such workers are utilised as a means of gaining legitimacy and

cultivating trust with the local politicians.
