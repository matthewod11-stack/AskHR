either zero leaders across all leadership roles, one leader, or two leaders). A MANOVA revealed significant differences between the different leadership structures for all outcomes (Wilk’s Λ = .58, F(54,2599.99) = 5.48, p < .001; partial η2 = .09; see Table 7). Bonferroni post-hoc analysis revealed that teams with a high number of task, social, and external leaders (HHH) scored significantly higher than other teams on role clarity, task cohesion, collective efficacy, intention to continue, and perceived performance. Furthermore, the teams with a high num- ber of leaders in all three roles (HHH) also showed significantly less role conflict (compared to LHH and Balanced groups) and less task and relationship conflict (compared to all other groups). The results thus reveal that, in contrast to H2, it is not a balanced number of leaders in each role, but rather a high degree of shared leadership across and within the different lead- ership roles that yields the most benefits for team functioning and team effectiveness.
