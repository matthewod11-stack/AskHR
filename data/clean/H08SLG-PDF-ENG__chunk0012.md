# How to Encourage Spacious Mode

To give employees permission to spend time thinking, learning,

innovating, and collaborating, you’ll need to rethink how you

communicate and which behaviors you reward. For example, Toni, a

regional manager at a large U.S. retailer we spoke with during our research, counted herself lucky: “My chief people oﬃcer has a real sense

of spaciousness around her and the way she shows up. I feel like I’ve got

a lot of permission and protection from her in my role.”
