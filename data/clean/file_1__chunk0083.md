The existence of the gender pay gap almost all over the world has also generated the need to better understand various factors contributing to it (Blau and Kahn, 2006; Rubery, Grimshaw and Figueiredo, 2005). Auster (1989) grouped the main explanations of the gender pay gap into two main categories: macro level, where women are seen as a homogeneous group, and micro level, which concentrates on psychological approaches viewing women as a heterogeneous diverse group. At the macro level the focus is on economic theories, which provide explanations of the phenomenon based on such factors as differences in education, work experience, amount of starting salary as well as general explanations such as different types of discrimination (e.g., Grybaite, 2006; Keaveny et al., 2007; Mitra, 2002). Micro level explanations of the gender pay gap include such personal factors as individual preferences and forces, which change values and attitudes towards working conditions and compensation practices (e.g., Bren and Garcia-Penalosa 2002; Hakim, 2000; Giapponi and McEvoy, 2006).
