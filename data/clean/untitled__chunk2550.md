# CONCLUSION

Although certainly not exhaustive, this chapter has at- tempted to review some highlights in the history of health psychology, respecting that its roots are as old as human his- tory. Within health psychology, there have been a number of trends over the past century. The inﬂuence of psychody- namic theories and speciﬁcity theories as explanatory mod- els has decreased. Focus on psychophysiological processes and the identiﬁcation of pathways among systems (particu- larly neuroendocrine and immunologic) has increased. Sta- tistical models have been developed that permit examination of multiple variables through multivariate analyses and path analyses, thus facilitating more sophisticated theoretical model building. Social and ecological dimensions to under- standing health and illness have been added. Empirically supported psychological interventions for the prevention and amelioration of disease and disorders have been devel- oped. Attention to the need to apply behavioral science to the improvement of the health care system and health policy has increased. More attention has been focused on issues of gen- der and ethnic cultural diversity in health behavior research and the delivery of health care services, and culturally sensi- tive interventions have been identiﬁed.

Historically, the reasons for the rapid growth of health psychology in the United States and Europe (and we might

add, Japan) over the last 30 years appear similar (Gentry, 1984; Ogden, 1996; Taylor, 1999):

- The shift in patterns of mortality and morbidity from com- municable diseases, such as tuberculosis and inﬂuenza, to chronic diseases (cancer and cardiovascular disease) and accidents.

- The recognition of behavioral causes associated with these diseases (such as smoking, high-fat diet, lack of seat belt use).

- The rising costs of health care and the increased support
