Zink & Gutman, ). Furthermore, many states have passed laws strength- ening this conditional privilege. One way to avoid losing a defamation suit is to provide only behavioral information in a reference. That is, rather than say- ing “This employee is a jerk,” you might say “He was warned three times about yelling at other employees and four employees requested that they not have to work with him.” A good way to reduce the possibility of a lawsuit is to have the applicant sign a waiver such as those shown in Figure .b–d. The waiver in Figure .b is used by a reference writer, and the other two are used by the orga- nization checking references. The one in Figure .c waives claims against peo- ple providing references to the organization, and the one in Figure .d waives future claims against the organization so that it can provide references about the employee if he leaves the organization. Waivers are used by % of organi- zations (Burke, b).

In recent years, several companies have emerged that make their living by contacting companies to see what they will say about former employees. These firms are hired by applicants who are concerned that their former employer might be providing a negative reference. These “reference detectives” contact the former employer under the guise of being a company considering hiring the for- mer employee. The reference information is then passed on to the client, who has the option of filing a defamation suit if he or she doesn’t like what is being said (Cadrain, ).

Because an employer can be guilty of negligent hiring for not contacting ref- erences, a former employer also can be guilty of negligent reference if it does not provide relevant information to an organization that requests it. For example, if Dinero Bank fires John Smith for theft and fails to divulge that fact to a bank that is thinking of hiring Smith, Dinero Bank may be found liable if Smith steals money at his new bank.

I, , have asked Dr. Marcus Kildare to write a letter of reference to accompany my application to graduate school. I understand that Dr. Kildare has a professional responsibility to write an honest and accurate letter about my past behavior and academic performance and his judgment about my potential for graduate school. Because I understand his need to provide an honest opinion, I waive my right to any future defamation or other legal claims arising from his reference. As a condition of this waiver, Dr. Kildare understands the importance of providing accurate information and agrees to provide what he believes to be an accurate and fair appraisal of my past behavior and potential.
