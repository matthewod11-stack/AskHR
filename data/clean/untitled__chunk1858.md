# The Conditioned Reﬂex

Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936) was one of the most inﬂuential scientists of his time. Although his work was almost exclusively concerned with animals, he made sig- niﬁcant contributions to human psychopathology. In 1914, in the course of conducting an experimental investigation of discrimination in a dog, Pavlov made a ﬁnding of signiﬁ- cance to the understanding of neurosis. While investigating the dog’s capacity to discriminate between different shapes, the shapes were progressively altered until no discrimination could be made. When the hitherto quiet dog was brought back into the laboratory room, it struggled when harnessed in its stand, whined, and bit at the apparatus. “In short,” wrote Pavlov, “it presented all of the symptoms of a condition of acute neurosis.” (Pavlov, 1927/1960, p. 291). Further re- search was undertaken with dogs differing in temperament, one type being extremely excitable, the other type extremely inhibitable. The results led Pavlov to conclude that experi- mental neurosis develops only in animals of extreme types, and the symptoms of neurosis differ in the two types and relate to the characteristics of the animals’ different nervous organizations.

Coincidentally, a violent storm ﬂooded Petrograd, and the dogs had to swim from the kennels to the laboratory. After this experience some of them displayed disturbed behavior similar to the “experimental neuroses” obtained in the labo- ratory. Pavlov concluded that “. . . a development of a chronic pathological state of the hemispheres can occur from . . . ﬁrst a conﬂict between excitation and inhibition which the cortex ﬁnds itself unable to resolve; second the ac- tion of extremely powerful and unusual stimuli.” (Pavlov, 1957, p. 318). Pavlov linked the phenomena seen in labora- tory studies of animals with those seen in human psy- chopathology in a manner that was to inﬂuence experimental psychopathology for several decades to come.

Much later, Howard Liddell at Cornell University investi- gated the adaptive behavior of sheep and goats in which the thyroid had been removed. Using a mild shock, Liddell was interested in how long the animal would require to make a conditioned anticipatory response. Both animals with and without thyroid glands learned this quite readily. Because of time pressure to complete his experiments, he increased the number of trials at each testing session. This had the unexpected effect of producing an experimental neurosis in certain sheep. They showed excitement, alarm, struggled to escape, showed rapid heart rate and breathing, micturation
