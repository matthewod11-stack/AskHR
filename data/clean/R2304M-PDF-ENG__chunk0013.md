## HBR / Magazine Article / Case Study: How Should a Start-Up Cut Its Burn Rate?

“Yes—there’s Alan,” Simone said, referring to their brilliant VP of

engineering. Rivals were constantly trying to poach him and his team.

“He’s asking for a discretionary fund for selected salary increases, new

software tools, and team-building events like their annual ski trip.”

Tyler sighed. “Does he realize we’re trying to cut costs?”

“I know,” Simone said. “But if we say no, chances are he’ll leave, and lots

of his team will follow.”

“Okay, let’s try to settle a few of these things,” Tyler said. “First, let’s

go with your idea to double down on talent development programs to

improve engagement. I want people to know we’re investing in their

growth. Second, please try to stretch on Chris Jones’s equity, but let’s

build in clear performance milestones and tell him we’re committed

to improving our beneﬁts over time. Third, tell Alan he can’t have an

exclusive discretionary fund, but we will do a comprehensive review

of his top performers’ compensation. And I’ll schedule a one-on-one

meeting to get him on board.”

“Got it,” Simone said. “Have you decided what you want to do about a second round of layoﬀs?”

“Not yet,” he said. “What do you think?”

“It’s a mistake to focus exclusively on runway,” she replied. “You have to

balance that with the fact that you need a great team motivated to work here. We lost some goodwill with the ﬁrst layoﬀs. A second round will aﬀect our credibility, and it will be tough to convince the team that the

future here is bright.”
