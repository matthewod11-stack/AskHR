Companies that invest in trust-building tools will ﬁnd that trust

enhances demand. A study of AI voice assistants found that trust has a

positive eﬀect on adoption, while trust was also key to users’ willingness

to persist with chatbots for health services. Customers are twice as likely

to engage with trustworthy AI, with workers being two-and-a-half times

more likely to utilize employers’ AI tools at work if they trust them.
