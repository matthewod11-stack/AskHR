# 1.4. Key definitions

In this section, I introduce some key concepts used in this work. I discuss them more in depth in section 2.

Gender in/equality: The thesis builds on many ideas of liberal feminist theory. This strand of feminist theory claims that in order to achieve gender equality both genders should be provided with equal opportunities which refer to treating individuals as equals (Baker, Lynch, Cantillon and Walsh, 2004; Lorber, 2005). I see gender inequality as socially constructed differences between men and women, which are filtered through traditional notions of masculinity and femininity, by which women continue to experience unequal treatment. Based on liberal feminist theory, I consider that, in order to achieve gender equality both genders should be provided with the same rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. Furthermore, in order to achieve gender equality at work, both male and female employees should be provided with equal opportunities, so they both are able ‘to realize their ambitions in working life’ (Lehto, 1999:9).
