Human Factors and Ergonomics (HF&E) is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on optimizing the interaction between humans and their environment, products, systems, or processes to enhance safety, efficiency, and overall well-being. It draws from various disciplines, including psychology, engineering, design, and physiology, to ensure that the design and implementation of technologies and systems take into account the capabilities and limitations of humans. In this discussion, we will delve into the key aspects of HF&E, its significance, principles, and applications.
