## Concept Definition and Theoretical Framework

Rousseau et al. (1998) proposed the following definition of trust as it has been conceptualized and studied across numerous disci- plines: “a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another” (p. 395). We use this conceptual definition in our analysis, recognizing that researchers have operationalized it in different ways and for different types of leadership referents (e.g., ranging from direct leader to organizational leadership). Following Yukl and Van Fleet (1992), we do not distinguish between leaders and managers because the terms are often used interchangeably in the literature.

Scholars have offered different explanations about the processes through which trust forms, the processes through which trust affects workplace outcomes, and the nature of the construct itself. To address this theoretical diversity, we distinguish between two qualitatively different theoretical perspectives of trust in leadership that appear in the literature and use these as a framework for the article.

One perspective focuses on the nature of the leader–follower relationship (or more precisely, how the follower understands the nature of the relationship). For instance, some researchers describe trust in leadership as operating according to a social exchange process (e.g., Konovsky & Pugh, 1994; Whitener, Brodt, Kors- gaard, & Werner, 1998). Followers see the relationship with their leader as beyond the standard economic contract such that the parties operate on the basis of trust, goodwill, and the perception of mutual obligations (Blau, 1964). The exchange denotes a high- quality relationship, and issues of care and consideration in the relationship are central. Researchers have used this perspective in describing how trust in leader–follower relationships elicits citi-

We use these theoretical perspectives as a framework in the following ways: First, we summarize how the perspectives have been and can be used to explain bivariate relationships between trust in leadership and its antecedents and consequences. Second, we develop hypotheses about how the two different theories imply different bivariate relationships, on the basis of the referent of trust and the definition of trust used, and test those hypotheses through meta-analytic procedures (moderator analyses). Last, we discuss how the two perspectives may be used to direct future research.
