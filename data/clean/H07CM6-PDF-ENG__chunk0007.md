But his own leadership was exactly the problem. And not for the typical

reasons you might guess.

I have been coaching CEOs and other C-suite leaders for two decades. In

a ﬁercely complex and challenging world, I’ve found that leaders, more

than ever, need to understand how what’s going on inside themselves

is inﬂuencing their actions in the outside world. Instead, for most

corporate leaders I’ve worked with – often doers more than deep

thinkers – what’s going on internally is a vast unexplored territory

that they haven’t valued much. That includes what they’re feeling,

where they’re feeling triggered, and how early experiences in their lives

inﬂuence the choices they’re making in the present.
