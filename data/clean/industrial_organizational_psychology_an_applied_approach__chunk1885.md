Come prepared. Have a pen and some paper so you can take notes if necessary. If there are snacks, take only your share. Leave some for the other audience members. Turn off your cell phone (or at least put it on vi- brate). If you must answer a call, do so outside of the training room. Don’t use your laptop to take notes—the sound of the keys is distracting to both the audience and the workshop presenter. If you want to take notes, do it the old-fashioned way—use a pen and paper! Try not to make unnecessary noises (e.g., crack- ing gum, rocking back and forth in your chair, constantly clicking a pen on and off). I can’t tell you how many times I have had audience members complain about another person making noise!
