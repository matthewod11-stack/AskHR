# run-of-the-mill intelligence chatter.

Whisper warnings can take various forms. They might be emerging

competitors that could disrupt market dynamics, murmurs of employee

dissatisfaction, nascent regulations with the potential to widen in scope, or seemingly insigniﬁcant operational ineﬃciencies that could

balloon if unchecked. Quite often, major product or safety failures start

as whisper warnings. In the mid-1990s plaintiﬀs’ attorneys began ﬁling

lawsuits alleging that the tread on Firestone tires on Ford Explorer

SUVs tended to separate at high speeds, causing accidents. Several

dealers, insurance agents, and other players received isolated reports of

problems during those years. But the larger problem remained hidden

until 2000, when media reports made its scope clear. Over time the

defective tires were implicated in 203 deaths (most of which occurred

after the earliest whisper warnings) and caused signiﬁcant reputational

damage to Ford and Firestone. Leaders who were more attuned to

whisper warnings might have reacted earlier.

Leaders need to pay careful attention to small signs of discontent that have the potential to fester and grow.
