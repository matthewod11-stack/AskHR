# HBR / Digital Article / Rebuilding Relationships Across Teams in a Hybrid Workplace

served to threaten a sense of community. On top of all that, most of our

remote work interactions have been with our immediate colleagues and

focused largely on the tasks at hand — research from Microsoft suggests

that cross-functional collaboration went down by 25% as interactions

within groups increased during the pandemic.

But fragmentation isn’t a byproduct of remote work. It results from a

lack of intentional bridgebuilding to link discrete groups and regions.

Silos were certainly prevalent before the pandemic — hybrid work has simply created new requirements for eﬀectively connecting teams that

must work together to achieve shared outcomes.

Working to rebuild bonds is especially important because most people

won’t be returning to work as the same people they were before

the pandemic; the last 18 months have changed all of us in some

way. Our values and priorities have shifted. Our senses of meaning

and purpose have broadened. Our anxiety has increased. For some,

tolerance increased while for others, it decreased. In short, we have to

get reacquainted with who we’ve each become. Otherwise, our natural

biases that formed about who each of us were will kick in, creating

unhelpful dissonance as we react to each other as we did prior to the

pandemic. For example, one executive said of his colleague, “She used

to have the best sense of humor, but now quips I make that she would

always laugh at get no reaction at all.” He’d failed to consider that she

was emotionally exhausted because her family was hit especially hard
