## company and satisfaction with management and employee programs.

In 2022, Microsoft decided to abandon its annual “engagement” survey

when managers realized that it consistently generated very positive

feedback despite reports that employee well-being was suﬀering in

some areas. They decided to dig deeper into areas where people were

clearly struggling. Their more frequent survey measures how much

employees are “thriving,” which they deﬁne as “being energized and

empowered to do meaningful work.”
