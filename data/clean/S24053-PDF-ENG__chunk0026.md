## pressure from outside forces and other teams within the organization.

When a team is not aligned on the priorities that propel its strategy, it

can easily lose direction. That’s what happened at a rapidly growing

technology company in Southeast Asia that we worked with. As it

navigated a major scale-up, its top team lost its way. Although the team

members shared a bold long-term vision to achieve unicorn status, they

had not articulated their immediate and short-term strategic priorities,

and in that vacuum, they individually began pressuring the founder to

fund their particular strategies. This created divisions within the team and pulled the company in diﬀerent directions, causing collaboration, innovation, and growth to suﬀer. The team was very busy, but much of

its time and energy went to working on the wrong things.

When the top team recognized that it had a problem, the leaders looked

inward to address it. First they developed an inclusive list of all the

strategic priorities, and the members each ranked their top three. After

discussion and debate, they settled on the ﬁve most critical priorities

for the business overall. At subsequent meetings, they kept their focus on those priorities. If things got oﬀ track, every team member had

permission to stop the discussion and refocus the team. Through

practice this became a team behavior.

The team also built a stronger sense of direction through clear

communication and active listening. Together, they arrived at an

understanding of how individual and team goals related to the overall

business strategy and began to cultivate a culture of ownership and commitment. Those eﬀorts paid oﬀ: The team stopped funding

initiatives in isolation and began moving in a uniﬁed direction.
