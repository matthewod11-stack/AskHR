I observed that having recognised an issue that was compromising patient safety, the team as a whole were both empowered and committed to proactively leading and enabling change (C1b). I saw clinical evidence being used and shared widely across the team coupled with an authentic approach to enabling person centredness (C1a/C1d). Robust systems and processes were also developed that embedded shared governance (AF5). Although I provided facilitation support, I saw that the team were driving the agenda forward themselves (A2/C1b). I felt and saw that ownership clearly sat with them, and as such it was possible to see how creativity and workplace effectiveness was growing and thriving underpinned by continuous learning and evaluation. The ward team was beginning to flourish! (C2)

Effective workplace culture is, as highlighted earlier, an immature concept with its characteristics distilled from a range of sources (theoretical analysis of practice development frameworks, expertise of practice developers, literature and research analysis) that implicitly suggests what it is. These characteristics have been brought together in the framework outlined in Table 3. Similar terms in the literature include: positive organisational culture (Department of Health, 2001a, b), healthy culture (Bevington et al., 2004a, b) and ‘transformational culture’ (Manley, 1997; 2000b; 2001; 2002; 2004). Further analysis would be required to ascertain the degree of fit between these different terms if indeed they are different concepts.

Changing workplace culture: implications for practice and research The framework aims to help healthcare teams develop an effective workplace culture if used to support systematic implementation of the individual and organisational enabling factors and attributes required. This will involve:  Making explicit core values 

Supporting and challenging each other as a team/across the patient pathway to ensure behaviour reflects the values espoused

- Developing a shared vision that reflects the purpose and direction of the team/patient

pathway Implementing the vision and direction through transformational leadership and skilled facilitation

- Developing and modelling ways of working that are: o Collaborative, inclusive, and participative o Flexible, creative and innovative

A willingness to adapt and implement changes through continuous learning and evaluation driven by the needs of patients

A number of tools and processes already exist to support aspects of the framework, for example; to enable ownership and enactment of a shared vision; to help reveal (in)consistencies between what is said and done; as well as other strategies for developing effective workplace cultures (McCormack et al., 2006; Coats, 2006; Warfield and Manley, 1990; Manley et al., 2007; McCormack et al., 2009; Lieshout and Cardiff, 2011). In addition to developing skills in challenging and supporting each other and giving and receiving feedback around patterns of behaviour, as well as implementing systems (structures and processes) that keep values at the forefront of daily decision-making and learning, there is a need to align these systems with organisation-wide approaches exemplified, for example, by magnet hospital research (McClure et al., 1983; Kramer and Schmalenberg, 1988). Organisational systems aligned to key values can support local workplaces to sustain key values in practice, but the opposite can also happen if organisational systems cause values to be dissonant. Whilst there is a need for organisational and strategic support, the actual work of changing the culture and developing effectiveness should be targeted at the micro-systems level.
