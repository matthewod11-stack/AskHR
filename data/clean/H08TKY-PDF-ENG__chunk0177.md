## HBR / Digital Article / The Definitive HBR Strategy Glossary

Strategy statement: A clear, concise articulation of your company’s

strategy, in 35 words or less. This statement should deﬁne:

- the objective that the strategy is designed to achieve

- the scope of the business

- the advantage by which the business will achieve its stated objective

To develop a strategy and craft a statement, leaders should start

by evaluating the industry landscape, which includes segmenting

customers and identifying unique ways of delivering value to the

ones the ﬁrm targets. They should also analyze competitors’ current

strategies and predict how they might change. The key is to ﬁnd the

sweet spot where the ﬁrm’s capabilities and customers’ needs align in a

way that competitors cannot match.
