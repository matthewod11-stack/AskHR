# Selection

203

In Chapter , you learned that many laws and regulations affect employee selec-

tion methods. In Chapters  and , you learned about the ways in which to recruit and select employees. In this chapter, you will learn how to evaluate whether a particular selection method is useful and how to use test scores to make a hiring decision. Throughout this chapter, you will encounter the word test. Though this word often conjures up an image of a paper-and-pencil test, in industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology, test refers to any technique used to evaluate someone. Thus, employment tests include such methods as references, interviews, and assessment centers.
