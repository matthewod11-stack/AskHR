# HBR / Spotlight / New Rules for Teamwork

problem-solving sessions in person, compared with 59% of those who

ran them remotely.

The data also shows that these beneﬁts aren’t linear. Teams that colocate more than 50% of the time increasingly have to make diﬃcult

trade-oﬀs when it comes to work-life balance and the ability to conduct

focused work. At McKinsey and at other organizations, we’ve found that

teams working remotely about 50% of the time are twice as likely to have suﬃcient recovery from work and are signiﬁcantly more likely to

ﬁnd their jobs sustainable.

Knowing what to measure is critical. For example, trauma centers

determine team eﬀectiveness by measuring how long it takes to

stabilize a patient—a major factor in survival. When experimenting

with methods to reduce stabilization time, some centers tried placing

timers in each trauma bay. Research showed that this simple action

signiﬁcantly reduced stabilization time. The point is that when the right

metrics are identiﬁed and collected, it becomes clear what practices to
