# Motivating Employees

For a training program to be effective, employees must be motivated to attend training, perform well in training, and apply their training to their jobs.

Motivating Employees to Attend Training The most obvious way to “motivate” employees to attend training is to require them to attend training “on the clock.” However, the majority of training opportu- nities are optional, and % of training opportunities take place on the employee’s own time (Galvin, ). Here are some strategies to motivate employees to attend training:

Relate the training to an employee’s immediate job. Employees are more likely to attend when the material covered in training will directly affect their immediate job performance. For example, employees would be more motivated to attend a training session on a computer program that the organization will begin using in two weeks than a training session on “Future Trends in Office Automation.” Thus, training should be provided “just in time” rather than “just in case.” Make the training interesting. Employees are more likely to attend when they know they will have a good time as well as learn something useful. Increase employee buy-in. When employees play a role in choosing and planning the types of training offered, they are more likely to attend. Baldwin, Magjuka, and Loher () found that employees given a choice about training programs were more motivated than employees not given a choice. Employees given a choice, but then not given the program they chose, were the least motivated. Provide incentives. Common incentives for attending training include certificates, money, promotion opportunities, and college credit. Microsoft increased employee participation in voluntary training by ,% when it created a program, “Ready, Set, Go,” in which employees who participated in voluntary training received points that could be exchanged for merchandise, travel, and gift certificates (Renk, ). Provide food. Medeco Security Locks in Salem, Virginia, has optional monthly training sessions in which a topic is presented while the employees eat lunch provided by the company. Consultants Bobbie Raynes and Ge Ge Beall both have used free pizza as incentives to get employees to attend short training sessions during lunch or dinner.
