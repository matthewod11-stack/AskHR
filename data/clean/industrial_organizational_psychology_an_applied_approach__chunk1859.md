# Establishing Goals and Objectives

Once training needs have been determined, the first step in developing a train- ing program is to establish the goals and objectives for the training. It is impor- tant that these goals and objectives be obtainable given the time and resources allocated to the training. For example, if your organizational analysis indicated that due to financial and time constraints a four-hour training session is all that the organization can afford to teach its supervisors conflict management skills, it would be unreasonable to establish the goal that supervisors be able to mediate conflicts between employees. Instead, a more reasonable goal might be that by the end of the four-hour training, supervisors will be able to identify the common causes of conflict. When the organization can afford several days of training, the goal of obtaining conflict mediation skills might be more obtainable.

Training goals and objectives should concretely state the following (Mager,

What learners are expected to do The conditions under which they are expected to do it The level at which they are expected to do it

In other words, vague objectives such as “to be a better salesperson” should be replaced with specific objectives such as increasing customer contacts by % and increasing new accounts by %.
