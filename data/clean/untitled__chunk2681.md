## OF AN ETHNIC MINORITY PSYCHOLOGICAL PUBLICATION 495 Lillian Comas-Diaz

This chapter differs from the others in form and format. Instead of having a continuous history of the ﬁeld, we have elected to present historical issues from the perspectives of 10 authors, representing various ethnic orientations, with views on their thoughts and experiences in dealing with eth- nic issues in the ﬁeld of psychology.

Some of these vignettes are very personal and some reﬂect on important turning points in the history of psychology re- lating to ethnic minorities. Each of the brief essays tells an aspect of the story that should be remembered as the science and profession of psychology moves into the twenty-ﬁrst century.
