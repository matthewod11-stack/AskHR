## PLANNING AND FUTURE- PROOFING YOUR AI IMPLEMENTATION

Project implementation roadmap: Building and scaling with success Successfully embedding AI into enterprise operations requires a measured, progressive approach. The most successful enterprise AI programs evolve like compound interest - each phase multiplies the value of previous investments. This journey unfolds across four key phases, each one expanding both technical depth and operational breadth.

Note: Many of the companies we work with are able to significantly accelerate this implementation timeline with the right level of motivation and partnership, condensing this 13 month+ implementation process into a few months, if not weeks. FeatherSnap integrated Claude in Amazon Bedrock with its smart bird feeder in under 90 days, while DoorDash built a voice-operated self-service generative AI contact center solution in only 2 months.
