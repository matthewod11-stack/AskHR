# to the employee.

An employer who fails to provide the required notice to the unit of local government is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each day of violation. The employer may avoid this penalty by satisfying the liability to each employee within three weeks after the closing or layoﬀ.

WARN does not preempt any other Federal, state, or local law, or any employer/employee agreement that requires other notiﬁcation or beneﬁt. Rather, the rights provided by WARN supplement those provided by other Federal, state, or local laws.

General information about WARN, worker's guide (PDF), and employer's guide (PDF) are available from the Employment and Training

Administration's website. Speciﬁc requirements of WARN may be found in the Act itself and the regulations at 20 CFR Part 639.
