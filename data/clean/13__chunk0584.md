# (a) Race.

Although race (i.e., being non-white) often serves as the basis for the stigmatization of targets in various nations, research shows evidence of cross-cultural differences in reactions to it. For example, in the U.S. stereotypes of blacks tend to be quite negative: relative to whites, they are viewed as being (a) less intelligent and achievement oriented, and (b) more lazy and aggressive (Stone-Romero, Stone, & Hartman, 2002). Even among African-Americans in the U.S., blacks with light skin are viewed more positively than those with dark skin. Interestingly, however, dark skin color does not always evoke equally negative stereotypes in other cultures. For example, skin color is not as stigmatizing in most Latin American and Caribbean nations (e.g., Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil) as it is in the U.S. (Marin & Marin, 1991). One reason for this is that people in Latin American and Caribbean nations often have mixed racial heritage, typically descending from three ‘‘racial’’ groups (i.e., Caucasian, black, and American Indian). In fact, in many Latin American countries (e.g., Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Brazil) the vast majority of individuals are of mixed race or mestizo (i.e., having Caucasian and Indian ancestry).
