# interview.

I should note that closed questions, designed to elicit a yes or a no,

can be helpful too, particularly when you need speciﬁc information—for example, “Do you have another oﬀer on the table?” But too many of

them can sound like an interrogation. Leading questions—for example,

“Which of our competitors is trying to poach you?”—should be avoided
