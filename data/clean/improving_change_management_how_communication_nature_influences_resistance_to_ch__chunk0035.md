Risk is one of the key principles of dialogic communication, as it means that

participants in a dialogic communication are able to recognize openly what they do not

know and assume uncertainty as part of the process as well as the results. In such

cases, the vulnerability of not having such control reveals itself as a position of strength

rather than weakness, and then new meaning can be developed collectively.

Commitment can be understood as genuineness, commitment to conversation,

and commitment to interpretations. Dialogue is honest and forthright. Sharing the same

meanings or working toward common understandings is crucial to dialogic relationships,

constantly fine-tuning language and trying to grasp the positions, beliefs, and values of

others before their positions can be equitably evaluated.

Those principles were developed by Kent and Taylor (2002) after an extensive

literature review in psychology, philosophy and communications. It is clear that a

dialogic approach is not easily operationalized or reduced to a series of steps, but those

principles consist of several coherent assumptions that can become the foundation

needed to investigate the authenticity of a dialogic participation process.

One of the challenges in promoting dialogic communication is to recognize the

interpretive rights of others, something not easily achievable in one single interaction,

and even more in one ongoing process. As Schein (2003) has already pointed out, the

roots of dialogue lie in discovering our internal choice process regarding when to speak

and what to say. The key to dialogue is to keep open to new interpretations, and this is

deeply connected to resisting change. As the sensemaking process makes it clear, our

own interpretations are implicit and our framings for reality are rarely conscious. It is by

interacting with other participants that one ends up either validating or not one’s own

interpretations. All is well when interaction reveals alignment between interpretations. It

is when responses vary from the expected that it is time to reconsider one’s own

interpretations, if there is an opening for doing so. However, if there is no

acknowledgment of the other’s right to interpret reality differently, the usual effect is to

classify the response as not valid or to start a persuasion effort. Both interlocutors’

reactions can be labeled as resistance, from each other’s point of view.
