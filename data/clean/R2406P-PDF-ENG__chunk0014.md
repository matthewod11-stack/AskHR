## HBR / Magazine Article / Life’s Work: An Interview with Ketanji Brown Jackson

How did you handle the scrutiny, particularly during those contentious conﬁrmation hearings?

I tried to prepare my family to make sure we understood what was

coming and were ready. Of course, being a mom, if my girls had said,

“We don’t want to be put through that,” then I would not have gone

for it. But they were very supportive. And the White House was very

But I am optimistic in that the debate is emblematic of democratic

engagement, which is positive. We have people who are focused on,

answer to the people. As judges, we are public servants. And it is up to

the people to determine what the structure and form and function of the

courts should be. As for the ethics code, it’s an interesting topic that has

recently come to the fore, and the Court has now adopted its own code,

which is generally modeled on what the lower courts do.

much every day the Court is sitting, which is a lot during the term, and

any day that we have a conference or a meeting where we discuss cases,

it’s bring-your-own to the justices’ dining room. That really does help
