## HBR / Digital Article / The Hidden Costs of Climate Change on the Workforce

The American Psychological Association reports that weather events

associated with climate change, such as ﬂooding and droughts, have

been increasingly associated with cases of depression, anxiety, and

post-traumatic stress disorders. Risks can range from mild stress and

insomnia to high-risk coping behavior such as increased alcohol use,

with long-term and often large-scale eﬀects impacting overall well-

being.

What’s striking is how mental health impacts of climate change can be

felt across an entire workforce, even if only a subset of employees are

physically impacted by speciﬁc climate events at a moment in time.

For example, while California wildﬁres directly aﬀect local employees’

homes and communities, colleagues in other regions may experience

heightened anxiety, stress, and concern for their coworkers’ well-being

while they also grapple with the broader implications of the climate

crisis. Consequences can range from climate anxiety accompanied by

feelings of guilt, anger, and shame (which can lead to changes in mood

and behavior) to “solastalgia,” which describes the emotional distress,

sense of powerlessness, and lack of control felt due to environmental
