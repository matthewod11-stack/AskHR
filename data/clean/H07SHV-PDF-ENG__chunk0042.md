# and fears of failure.

And everybody out there watching, you know I’m talking about you

too. So take care of these pathologies because these are addictions like

anything else, and there’s a lot of brain chemistry in that.

But the point is, you’re going to spend a ton of time doing that. And

if it’s drudgery, that’s bad. You don’t want drudgery. At very least it

should be something that’s pleasant and making it pleasant sometimes

it’s completely out of our grasp. If you have a job that you truly hate and

a boss who’s just the worst, well, that’s no good. But a lot of it is in our

hands, and this is a lot of what I’m working on and what I’m trying to

help people understand they can actually manage.
