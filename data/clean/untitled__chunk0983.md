# Two Distinct Psychologies of Emotion 169

and cognition, with discrepancy between expectation and actuality producing the arousal.

Just as interruption and discrepancy theory asked the question that Schachter had left out—“What is the source of the autonomic arousal?”—so it was asked later by LeDoux in 1989: “How is it that the initial state of bodily arousal . . . is evoked? . . . Cognitive theories require that the brain has a mechanism for distinguishing emotional from mundane situ- ations prior to activating the autonomic nervous system” (LeDoux, 1989, p. 270). LeDoux suggested that separate sys- tems mediate affective and cognitive computations, with the amygdala being primarily responsible for affective computa- tion, whereas cognitive processes are centered in the hip- pocampus and neocortex. The (conscious) experience of emotion is the product of simultaneous projections of the af- fective and cognitive products into “working memory.” In Mandler, it is discrepancy/interruption that provides a crite- rion that distinguishes emotional from mundane situations. Discrepant situations are rarely mundane and usually emo- tional; in other words—and avoiding the pitfall of deﬁning emotions—whenever discrepancies occur, they lead to vis- ceral arousal and to conditions that are, in the common language, frequently called emotional. Such constructivist analyses see the experience of emotion as “constructed” out of, that is, generated by, the interaction of underlying processes and relevant to a variety of emotional phenomena (Mandler, 1993, 1999).
