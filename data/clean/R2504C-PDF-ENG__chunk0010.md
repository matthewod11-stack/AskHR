are much better in person. People are realizing that they invent better

together, and I think they like being with one another.

Let’s talk about AI. Some analysts thought Amazon was relatively slow to get into AI in a big way. Are you happy with where you are now?

AI is probably the biggest technology transformation since the internet,

and it’s going to change every experience that we know. We have

substantial investments in the AI space. In the early days people

were excited about ChatGPT, which is a remarkable application, and

OpenAI’s model, which was a game changer. To pursue AI in earnest,

you need to invest in all three layers of the AI stack. We’re doing that. So

while there wasn’t a lot of attention early on—ChatGPT was kind of the

only large-scale generative AI application—I think people have slept a

little bit on the other layers of the stack, where we have big investments

and are doing really nicely.

Describe the bets you’re making in those AI layers.

The bottom layer of the AI stack is for model builders, and they care

about two things: the compute to do the training and the inference,

which is really the chip. And they care about services that can make it

easier to build models. We’ve built our own custom AI chip, Trainium,

that delivers high performance at low cost. We’ve also built a service

called SageMaker for people who are building their own models—to get

the data in, to experiment, to deploy into production.
