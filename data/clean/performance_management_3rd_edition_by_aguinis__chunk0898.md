## Chapter 6 â€¢ Gathering Performance Information

As discussed in Chapter 2, the performance management process includes several stages: prerequisites, performance planning, performance execution, performance assessment, performance review, and performance renewal and recontracting. An important component of the performance assessment stage is the use of appraisal forms. These forms are instruments used to document and evaluate performance. Chapters 4 and 5 provided a description of the various approaches and techniques that can be used to measure performance, but this chapter provides a more exhaustive description of the use of appraisal forms and their content. In addition, this chapter describes other issues related to the administration of appraisal forms, such as how often the supervisor and subordinate should meet to discuss performance issues and how to choose the source(s) of performance data (e.g., supervisors, self, subordinates, peers, or customers). The chapter concludes with a discussion of reasons why raters are likely, either intentionally or unintentionally, to distort performance ratings and what can be done to improve the accuracy of ratings.
