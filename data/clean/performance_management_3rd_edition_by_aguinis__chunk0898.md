# 6.1 APPRAISAL FORMS

At the core of any performance management system is the assessment of performance. Information on performance is collected by using forms, which can be filled out on paper or electronically. One advantage of filling out forms electronically is that the information is stored and can easily be shared, for example, between the manager filling out the form and the human resources (HR) department.

In many instances, the objectives are weighted in terms of importance, which facilitates the calculation of an overall performance score. Finally, this section can also include a subsection describing conditions under which performance was achieved, which may help explain why the employee achieved the (high or low) performance level described. For exam- ple, a supervisor may have the opportunity to describe specific circumstances
