Training can increase employee productivity and contribute to achieving

organizational goals. According to Nilson, training plays an important role in developing

a productive work force and getting operations so effective that they contribute more

directly to outputs/goals of the organization (1990:1). She explains productivity as

outputs exceeding inputs, and the productive employee strives consistently to get more

units of output per unit of input. If all employees have this mentality , to optimize

resources and maintain a positive net profit of outputs over inputs, organizations can be

highly effective in achieving their goals. Nevertheless , we all know we have productive

and unproductive , high performing and low performing , and motivated and unmotivated

employees. As Scientific Management teaches us, a "mental revolution" has to occur in

workers' minds to foster high productivity in every employee within the organization. As

to what methods accomplishes this, there are many. Training is an excellent option for

increased productivity , personal growth, and enhanced employee performance . Training

should be selected for the right reasons and for the right people.

Training contributes in a majot; way to the quality and effectiveness of each

process involved in performing the job (Nilson, 1990:8-9). I believe well-trained

employees can provide high quality work, high productivity rates and quality customer

service. The personal satisfaction of being competent and able to do a good job is a

powerful motivator to do a better job in the future. Training is one major approach to

helping people control or manage change, because an employee who leaves training with

confidence in new knowledge and skills can handle a changing work place (Nilson,

1990:1). We all need to know and learn new information to acquire new skills and

develop new attitudes to cope with changes in the environment . Nilson provides three

tasks essential for public managers to know if training is the right method to pursue in

any organization. First, a manager must precisely define what are the employees'

training needs. Secondly, figure out the best way to present the training information, so

that such training as required is presented and learned in an appropriate amount of time.

Thirdly, as a manager, get the right training to the right people, so that the resources it

uses are an investment in productivity (1990:3) .

An effective training program will provide endless opportunities for practice in

solving problems directly related to the skill that they are teaching (Stokes, 1966:27). I

believe employees are continually faced with problems in their jobs and it is the mark of

their competence to be able to solve problems with minimum supervision or outside help.

Performing the work is the only way a trainee can get the necessary practice, and most of

this is done on the job. Many authors conclude that practice is a factor which leads to

smooth work patterns and the method by which employees develop skill. Stokes (1966)
