organizations (e.g., Bank of America’s New York City building; Rosman 2011) use card-key dispatch systems to apportion elevator access, letting ‘‘bank VIPs ride sepa- rately from rank-and-ﬁle staff’’.

In contrast, high-involvement organizations design their physical environment so as to ‘‘reinforce the classless structure of the organization’’ (Lawler 1986, p. 200) (Chan et al. 2007). Common practices include elimination of reserved parking, of executive dining rooms and wash- rooms, of special building entrances, executive elevators, or any other segregated facilities (Lawler 1986; Lawler and Worley 2006; Martin 1992; Morand 2010). There are many reasons why organizations might engage in these practices communication, (to engender collegiality, save money, to conform to institu- tional environments [i.e., mimicking other organizations]), yet these distributive practices do introduce a greater equalization of outcomes, and that such may properly be conceptualized relative to claims of existential member equality.
