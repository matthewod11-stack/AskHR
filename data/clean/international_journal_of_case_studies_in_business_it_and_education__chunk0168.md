- 11. ABCD ANALYSIS OF CHOSEN RESEARCH PROPOSAL :

The ABCD analysis is a method used to assess a particular area, focusing on its advantages, benefits, constraints, and disadvantages [112]. This method helps individuals to identify key factors related to a problem or situation and develop effective and efficient solutions [113]. However, it's important to remember that the ABCD analysis should be used in combination with other tools to make well- informed decisions [114]. When evaluating a proposal, it's important to consider multiple perspectives and potential areas of risk [115]. The information gained through the ABCD analysis can be used to adjust proposals and mitigate risks before they become problematic [116].
