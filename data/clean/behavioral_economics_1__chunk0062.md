# VI. Conclusions

Empirically-driven behavioral economics uses evidence from psychology and other disciplines to inform

models of limits on rationality, willpower and self-interest, to explain anomalies and make new predictions.

This approach deliberately rejects the “F-twist” premise that theories should not be judged by their assumptions,

on the grounds that models based on more realistic assumptions will make better predictions.

Many concepts have already been proposed, which generally add one or more parameters to models of

choice, including risk, ambiguity and time (Table 1).

This essay highlights a few areas of active research. A central question is the market implications of

limits on rationality, willpower, and self-interest. While experience and sorting might weaken the impact of

limited individual rationality on firm behavior, these firms also supply goods to a demand side of the market

where institutional and social forces are not as strong as erasing the effects of limits. Whether market forces

therefore limit the impact of mistakes, or exaggerate them (by creating hyper-rational firms that are optimized

to exploit consumer limits) is therefore an open question.

Important trends in behavioral economics including “franchising” of ideas to application areas (such as

finance and labor economics), development of theoretical models, field studies, and including new types of

psychology (such as attention, attribution, categorization, and limited memory). Another small emerging field is

“neuroeconomics”, a subfield of behavioral economics which uses details of neural activity to inform

microfoundations. Some of these studies are likely to show neural evidence consistent with rational choice,

others have already shown circuitry consistent with behavioral economics constructs, and still others will point

to constructs that indicate state-dependence of preference (where the states are internal brain states).
