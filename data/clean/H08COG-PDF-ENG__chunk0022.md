# How Disagreement Affects Evaluation

Finally, to test the impact that disagreement, or variability, itself has

on perceived value, we recruited 401 U.S. participants with experience

in investing. We told them they would be asked to rank how willing

they would be to invest in an innovative electronic product, but ﬁrst

they would receive ratings of the product from their close friends and

advisors. One group saw a wide variability in advisor ratings, with some

ranking the product very highly and others giving it a low score. In

the other group, their advisors had a narrow range of opinions, with

most people ﬁnding the product to have middling worth. Participants

were then asked to rank how valuable the investment would be, their

likelihood to invest, how risky they viewed the investment, and how

novel or unique the product sounded.
