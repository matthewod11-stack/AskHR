# Penalties/Sanctions

ERISA confers substantial law enforcement responsibilities on the Department of Labor. Part 5 of Title I of

ERISA gives the Department of Labor authority to bring a civil action to correct violations of the law, provides investigative authority to determine whether any person has violated Title I, and imposes criminal penalties on

any person who willfully violates any provision of Part 1 of Title I.

EBSA has authority under ERISA Section 502 to assess civil penalties for a number of diﬀerent violations. For

instance, EBSA has authority under ERISA Section 502(c)(2) to assess civil penalties for reporting violations. A

penalty of up to $1,100 per day may be assessed against plan administrators who fail or refuse to comply with annual reporting requirements. Section 502(i) gives the agency authority to assess civil penalties against

parties in interest who engage in prohibited transactions with welfare and nonqualiﬁed retirement plans. The

penalty can range from ﬁve percent to 100 percent of the amount involved in a transaction.

A parallel provision of the Code directly imposes an excise tax against disqualiﬁed persons, including

employee beneﬁt plan sponsors and service providers, who engage in prohibited transactions with tax‑qualiﬁed retirement plans.

Finally, Section 502(l) requires the Department of Labor to assess mandatory civil penalties equal to 20

percent of any amount recovered with respect to ﬁduciary breaches resulting from either a settlement

agreement with the Department of Labor or a court order as the result of a lawsuit by the Department of Labor.
