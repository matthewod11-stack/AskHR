## their strategy down to a few core elements on the who-what-how

dimensions, which they then use to guide their strategic investments.

For example, Christian Van Thillo, the Chairman of DPG Media Group,

the leading media company in Belgium and the Netherlands identiﬁed

the following core elements in DPG Media Group’s successful strategy:

- 1) provide high-quality, professional journalism and be a multi-media

(print, radio, TV, and online) company in every market they operate; 2)

be the undisputed leader in small geographies so that advertisers and

consumers will think of them along with Google and Facebook; and 3)

focus on market leading brands only.

Having a clear sense of the core features of the company’s strategy

helps the senior executives of a ﬁrm avoid making decisions that may

dilute the ﬁrm’s strategic diﬀerentiation. As Van Thillo commented:

“We see opportunities around us all the time. It is easy to get excited

and chase the growth, but all these opportunities need to be evaluated

as to whether they ﬁt with our strategy. And to make this assessment,

you need to be clear in your head what the key elements of your strategy

are.”
