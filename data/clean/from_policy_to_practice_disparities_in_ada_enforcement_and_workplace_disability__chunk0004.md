Abstract: In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was introduced in order to fulfill equal rights and opportunities of people with disabilities, especially in employment opportunities. Although the ADA develops a consistent body of law, its implementation and usefulness differ greatly in the 50 states of the United States. This journal explores the differences in the implementation of the ADA and delivery of workplace disability rights by investigating the policy/practice gap. By laying out similarities and disparities in state-based compliance, enforcement activities, employer access, and experience of disabled workers, this paper discloses that there are systemic discontinuities caused by variations in laws, support, advocacy systems, and awareness among the states. Best practices in accessibility and inclusion are shown in high-compliance states, such as California and Massachusetts, whereas the other regions are shown to not do so well because of ineffective enforcement and the lack of support. In the conclusion, the paper presents specific policy recommendations that may help to improve the implementation of ADA, ensure better control, and promote an inclusive workplace culture on the national level. The study helps inform a more subtle observation of the unequal implementation of disability rights in the United States by highlighting such disparities.
