# Tie Strength

Structural hole theory is an elaboration and extension of earlier in- ﬂuential work on strong and weak ties. As a reminder, a tie is any connection (relationship) between any two individuals in a social system. Ties can vary in terms of their relative strength, with strong ties indicating greater emotional intensity, frequency, importance, or reciprocity than weak ties (Granovetter, 1973). Another way to think about strong ties is as friendships, whereas weak ties are more like acquaintances (Brass & Krackhardt, 1999). Research has shown that high self-monitors tend to demonstrate lower overall commit- ment to their social and work relationships than low self-monitors (Day et al., 2002; Snyder, Gangestad, & Simpson, 1983; Snyder & Simpson, 1984). Thus, it would be expected that high self-monitors would be more willing than low self-monitors to break strong tie re- lationships, to suffer less from strong tie disruptions, and to be less embedded in networks of constraining strong tie groups such as Simmelian ties—those in which two people are reciprocally and strongly tied to each other, and each is reciprocally and strongly tied to a third party in common (Krackhardt, 1999; Krackhardt & Kilduff, in press).

A deﬁning feature of strong ties is that they tend to be charac- terized by trust and mutual reciprocation. Strong ties provide for more credible and timely information than weak ties and also pro- vide social and emotional support. Thus, an advantage of strong ties is that they build social capital in the form of loyalty, trust, mu- tual respect, and emotional attachment, which provide a solid foundation for social inﬂuence. Strong ties have also been shown to be advantageous in the transfer of complex knowledge across organization units (Hansen, 1999). A disadvantage of strong ties is that they require a good deal of emotional energy to maintain; they require considerable investment in terms of an individual’s commitment to the tie. Strong ties also may be difﬁcult to break
