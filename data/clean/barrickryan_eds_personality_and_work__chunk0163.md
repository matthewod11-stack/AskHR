# 40 PERSONALITY AND WORK

over time, Watson, Clark, McIntyre, and Hamaker (1992) found that people who were high in positive affectivity were more likely than those who were low in positive affectivity to engage in a variety of activities, including going to parties and museums and taking weekend trips. In addition, Csikszentmihalyi and Wong (1991) found that when students completed surveys multiple times dur- ing the day, the reports of positive affect were correlated with higher feelings of activity and greater participation in a variety of activities. There is even some experimental evidence that induced pleasant moods can lead to greater preference for active behaviors. Cunningham (1988b) found that students who had experienced a pleasant mood induction were more likely than those who did not experience the induction to express a preference for engag- ing in social and nonsocial active behaviors.

Implications for Work and Productivity Although both correlational and experimental evidence demon- strates the link between happiness and activity, the precise mech- anism underlying this relation has yet to be speciﬁed. Do happy people feel more energy than unhappy people in all types of ac- tivities, or do happy people seek out activities that are active and require energy? The answer to this question has important impli- cations for the effect of worker happiness on productivity. If hap- piness makes people feel more active in general, there would be beneﬁts in a wide variety of jobs. If happiness makes people seek out active occupations, then the beneﬁts of happiness may be lim- ited to these active jobs, and the happy worker may even be less productive in more sedate or less exciting occupations. Further- more, the happy worker’s desire for activity may lead to greater ab- senteeism because the worker is likely to seek more exciting activities (Furnham & Miller, 1997).
