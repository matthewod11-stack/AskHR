Some of the clearest examples of the obelisk model aren’t comingfrom the big firms but from a fast-growing wave of AI-nativeboutiques.

It positions itself as conflict free,meaning not encumbered by audit-advisory entanglements orclient conflicts, and AI-native by design.

Itdoesn’t hire large, entry-level analyst cohorts or rely onhierarchical, middle management structures; it has eliminatedthe classic leveraged pyramid of billable hours in favor of fast,expert-driven delivery, a textbook expression of the obelisk inaction.

Disruptive Edge is applying similar principles. For example,rather than have junior consultants spend weeks building
