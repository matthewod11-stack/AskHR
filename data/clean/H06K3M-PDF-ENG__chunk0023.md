- Using triage rules in email. Email begets email, and we all have

a tendency to want to answer the quick request that we can feel

good about solving. More eﬃcient people tend to block emails into diﬀerent categories to process them at a given point in time, rather

than allowing constant disruptions.

- Using “standing” meetings to make team problem-solving happen

faster. More eﬃcient leaders use weekly touch points to discuss one- oﬀ issues, rather than allowing excess disruptions to occur ad hoc.

Team members post issues on collaboration platforms like Slack or

Microsoft Teams, and the team is encouraged to solve what they can ahead of meetings. Over time, leaders ﬁnd that the number of one-oﬀ

issues funneling through them declines substantially as the team gets

better at knowing who to turn to for what.
