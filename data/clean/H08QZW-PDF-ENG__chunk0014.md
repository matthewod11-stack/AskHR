No matter how busy you are or how jam-packed your schedule, stay

in the room. “Don’t book another meeting right after,” says DeChurch.

“Chances are there’s someone in the meeting who wanted to speak up

but didn’t feel comfortable saying it in front of the group.” So, stick

around and be there for your team. After the meeting, distribute any

materials that were discussed or referenced. And let everyone know

what to expect in terms of regular updates on the new normal. Follow

up with employees whose roles have changed. “In situations like this,

people who were once peripheral can become central, while those who

were central may feel marginalized,” says DeChurch. For example, the

ﬁnance team might now take the spotlight, while marketing and new

business development roles could be downplayed. “Make sure to talk

to the people feeling this shift most intensely,” she says. “Hear from

them and listen to their concerns.” Be honest, sincere, and inclusive,

add Karamanis. “It can be hard in times like these, but it’s the right

thing to do.”
