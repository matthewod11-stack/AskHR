# ABSTRACT

Despite the considerable research on strategic persistence, there remains a lack of

understanding as to why companies persist with underperforming workers. Our study seeks to

fill this gap in the literature by integrating the concepts of the paradox of success, external

legitimacy, nepotism and the escalation of commitment perspectives to develop an integrated

explanation for persistence with underperforming workers. Drawing on insights from two

emerging economies in Africa: Ghana and Nigeria, we uncovered that persistence with

underperforming workers stem from information hoarding, favouritism through tribalism and

externally imposed constraints. Our study also articulates the underlying processes inherent in

such persistence. The wider implications for theory and public policy are examined.
