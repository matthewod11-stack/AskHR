Emerging Trends and Needs in Personality Research and Practice Beyond Main Effects Leaetta M. Hough

Changes in world economies and their workforces continue to change the world of work, and thus the practice and science of industrial/ organizational (I/O) psychology. Movement from an industrial economy to a service and information economy, globalization, dig- itization, workforce diversity, and the increasingly rapid rate of change have created work settings that require different compe- tencies and different models for understanding and explaining behavior. I/O psychologists have responded, and personality con- structs and theories have provided the content for advances in I/O thinking (Hough, 2001).
