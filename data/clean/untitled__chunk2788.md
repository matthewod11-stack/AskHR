# THE 1913 CONGRESS THAT WASN’T

The history of science is generally viewed in terms of theo- ries proposed and experiments performed. It is not always recognized that science is also a conglomeration of people who have their own agendas, piques, jealousies, or political idiosyncrasies. Based on access to the correspondence and ﬁles of major ﬁgures in American psychology, Evans and Scott (1978) relate how the idea for holding the 1913 Inter- national Congress of Psychology in the United States was ﬂoated during the 1905 congress in Rome and accepted at the 1909 congress in Geneva. A petition had been prepared by Morton Prince (Harvard), which named James Mark Baldwin (Johns Hopkins) as congress president and William James (Harvard) as honorary president. However, the petition was not a formal invitation, and no U.S. institution offered to host the congress. Personal rivalries prevented effective organiza- tion. The project was ﬁnally abandoned in 1912 with no other country expressing willingness to assume responsibility at such a late date. Because of World War I, no congresses were convened between 1914 and 1923, when the International Congress met in Oxford. It was not until 1929 that the United States played host at Yale University in New Haven. As noted by Rosenzweig et al. (2000), it was ironic that Cattell, who

had been embroiled in the rivalries swirling around the ill-fated 1913 congress, having outlived his rivals, was elected president of the 1929 congress and gave one of the major lectures.
