## Toward a Theory of Reputation in Organizations

resource acquisition. Interestingly, she found that access to resources was given based on personal contact and mutual trust. Thus, we might expect that trust would develop over time as part of one’s reputation within the research networks.

In general, individuals attempt to inﬂuence others’ perceptions of the social networks within which they are embedded (Cialdini & De Nicholas, 1989). They can be successful at this task because perceptions of the context in even relatively small organizational networks vary considerably from one person to the next (Krackhardt, 1990). Even when individuals are not trying to actively inﬂuence others, their actions may be interpreted by an audience as unusual (Haviland, 1977).

We believe that the various components of reputation combine in interesting, important, and quite complex ways. Indeed, similar in nature to how the resource-based view of the ﬁrm discusses this construct at the organization level, we envision a synergistic combination of qualities whereby the whole that is created is greater than the simple sum of the individual components (e.g., Barney, 1991). This creates a unique quality to personal reputation, and one that provides a source of personal sustained competitive advantage for the individual in social environments.

Deviation from Behavioral Norms As shown in Fig. 1, reputation is based on observable actions, and these actions must stand out in such a way that observers will ﬁnd them interesting enough to report to others (Haviland, 1977). When judging an incident, observers view the event with anticipations and assumptions about that event based on past information about the individual in question (Weick, 1979). These anticipations are based on the expected norms derived from roles that consist of those behaviors that are characteristic of the person and context being observed (Biddle & Thomas, 1966). The ‘‘surprise’’ (Weick, 1979, p. 4) is any deviation that varies too greatly from the norms for expected behavior in that context to be part of the role (Becker, 1963). When there is an inconsistency or surprise, the observer feels a need to explain it (Weick, 1979). Once the event is understood, the observer will attempt to attribute the cause of the event (Heider, 1958).

Also distinguishing the behavioral deviation in the eyes of observers is the way it is made salient and commands attentional focus. Social cognition scholars have deﬁned salience as ‘‘the phenomenon that when one’s attention is differentially directed to one portion of the environment rather than to others, the information contained in that portion will receive disproportionate weighting in subsequent judgments’’ (Taylor & Thompson,

1982, p. 175). Particularly in somewhat ambiguous situations, attention will be drawn to individuals who demonstrate behaviors that set them apart from others, leading to extreme evaluations (Taylor & Fiske, 1978). Thus, it is the salience of the deviant behavior that will attract observer attention, and begin the process of reputation building.

The possible deviations are anything that varies too widely from the average to be part of the role (Becker, 1963). Rindova et al. (2006) suggested that such deviance is what fuels celebrity status because the media reports on actions that represent deviations from the norm. Behaviors deviating from these roles force audiences to reevaluate the individual being observed (Biddle & Thomas, 1966). This reevaluation leads individuals to consider whether the focal individual is part of a group into which he/she was originally classiﬁed, or is regarded as an outsider (Becker, 1963). If an observer is able to reclassify an individual into a different group (i.e., dissolving the relationship between the norm and the individual), one where the repeated deviations are considered the norm, the future actions of the individual once again will be predictable, and make sense to the audience (Weick, 1979). Additionally, this new classiﬁcation should reduce ambiguity regarding the individual in question.

Even if the deviations from the norm do not propel the reputation- it is still beneﬁcial. building individual to a different normative status, Research has shown that when decision makers lack information about an employee, they rely on prevailing cognitions, such as stereotypes (Drazin & Auster, 1987). Furthermore, one manifestation of such prevailing cognitions in the can be reputation, and it could increase beneﬁcial workplace.
