# The Classical World before Plato

By distinguishing between Appearance and Reality, the Greeks of the ﬁfth century B.C.E. inaugurated philosophical and psychological inquiries into cognition. Various pre- Socratic philosophers argued that the way the world seems to us—Appearance—is, or may be, different from the way the world is in Reality. Parmenides argued that there is a ﬁxed reality (Being) enduring behind the changing appearances of the world of experience. Against Parmenides, Heraclitus argued that Reality is even more ﬂuid than our experience

suggests. This pre-Socratic distinction between Appearance and Reality was metaphysical and ontological, not psycho- logical. Parmenides and Heraclitus argued about the nature of a “realer,” “truer” world existing in some sense apart from the one we live in. However, drawing the distinction shocked Greeks into the realization that our knowledge of the world— whether of the world we live in or of the transcendental one beyond it—might be ﬂawed, and Greek thinkers added epis- temology to their work, beginning to examine the processes of cognition (Irwin, 1989).

One of the most durable philosophical and psychological theories of cognition, the representational theory, was ﬁrst advanced by the Greek philosopher-psychologists Alcmaeon and Empedocles. They said that objects emit little copies of themselves that get into our bloodstreams and travel to our hearts, where they result in perception of the object. The fa- mous atomist Democritus picked up this theory, saying that the little copies were special sorts of atoms called eidola. Philosophically, the key feature of representational theories of cognition is the claim that we do not know the external world directly, but only indirectly, via the copies of the object that we internalize. Representational theories of cognition in- vite investigation of the psychological mechanisms by which representations are created, processed, and stored. The repre- sentational theory of cognition is the foundation stone of Simon and Newell’s symbol-system architecture of cognition (see following).

Once one admits the distinction between Appearance and Reality, the question of whether humans can know Reality— Truth—arises. Epistemologies can be then divided into two camps: those who hold that we are conﬁned to dealing with shifting appearances, and those who hold that we can achieve genuine knowledge. (See Figure 6.1.) I will call the ﬁrst group the Relativists: For them, truth is ever changing be- cause appearances are ever changing. I will call the second group the Party of Truth: They propose that humans can in
