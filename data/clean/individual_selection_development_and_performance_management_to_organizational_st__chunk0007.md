## 310 â€¢ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, Fall 2002

ployees, has gradually become widespread in human resource management (Boyatzis, 1982; Lawler, 1994; Spencer & Spencer, 1993; Ulrich, 1997). Those characteristics that set these employees apart provide the basis for recruitment, selection, and development strat- egies that are effective and provide a high re- turn on investment.

By focusing on the full range of competencies or whole-person assessment, the emphasis is on potential, or what the person can bring to the organization, rather than on a set of narrowly defined tasks based on job requirements.

Human resource professionals must wisely invest their scarce resources. In the past, or- ganizations hired those who could perform a set of tasks, usually focusing on technical knowledge. These traditional job-based selec- tion and development strategies are less flex- ible than competency-based selection and development strategies. In rapidly changing business environments, organizations are rec- ognizing the value of a workforce that is not only highly skilled and technically adept, but more importantly, a workforce that can learn quickly, adapt to change, communicate effec- tively, and foster interpersonal relationships. These characteristics, or competencies, are critical to organizational survival, productiv- ity, and continual improvement.

By focusing on the full range of compe- tencies or whole-person assessment, the em- phasis is on potential, or what the person can bring to the organization, rather than on a set of narrowly defined tasks based on job require- ments. Organizations that select for compe- tencies such as creative thinking begin to build a high-performance culture. Using competen- cies as the basis for staffing provides the flex- ibility needed to select and place individuals where they can best serve the organization.
