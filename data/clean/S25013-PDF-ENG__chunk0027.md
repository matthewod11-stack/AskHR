AI endows algorithms with a high degree of independence, allowing

them to formulate strategies, take action, and keep reﬁning their

capabilities, all while adjusting to new situations without needing

direct human guidance. The possibility that AI tools might completely

take over tasks previously handled by humans, rather than just assist

with them, stirs up deep concerns and worries. A signiﬁcant majority
