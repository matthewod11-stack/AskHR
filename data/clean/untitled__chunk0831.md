# Cognitive Structures

Piaget (1952, 1972), among others, has staked out an alterna- tive position to the differential one. Piaget, who was never very interested in individual differences, viewed intelli- gence as arising from cognitive schemas, or structures that mature as a function of the interaction of the organism with the environment.
