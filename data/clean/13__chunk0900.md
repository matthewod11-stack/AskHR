interesting, and more relevant to today’s geographically dispersed and locally diverse organizations.

Oscar Firkins, the renowned writer and literary critic once said ‘‘Humor is not a postscript or an incidental afterthought; it is a serious and weighty part of the world’s economy. One feels increasingly the height of the faculty in which it arises, the nobility of things associated with it, and the greatness of services it renders.’’ This perspective comports with what we have been attempting to communicate in this paper. We believe that despite its apparent lightness and insigniﬁcance, humor is indeed a ‘‘weighty’’ issue that is deserving of substantial attention by researchers. Then again, our examination of humor teaches us that there’s value in being humorous and playful, and not taking ourselves too seriously, so we leave you with the following:

‘‘Sometimes life seems like a dream, especially when I look down and see that I forgot to put on my pants.’’ (Jack Handey, Deep Thoughts)
