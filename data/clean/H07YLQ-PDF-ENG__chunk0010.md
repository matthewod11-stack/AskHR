# What Are the Signs of a Bottleneck Boss?

- An over-scheduled, overstuﬀed calendar ﬁlled with agenda to-dos

- A business that can’t run on its own without a leader stepping in

- Clients who only feel special if they’re being fêted by the leader rather

than by sales team members, which results in the CEO becoming

overburdened with maintaining client relations, while the sales team

feels undervalued

- Key staﬀ who don’t feel empowered enough to lean into challenging

work (revealed by employee engagement reports)
