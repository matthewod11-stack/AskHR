# HBR / Digital Article / Research: How Family Motivates People to Do Their Best Work

again found that family motivation increased employees’ work eﬀort in

ways that led to enhanced productivity.

The reasons why family energizes extra work eﬀort are manifold. The

most straightforward is that employees want to ensure that they have

the ﬁnancial resources to sustain their family. But family motivates

many to work hard for reasons beyond ﬁnances. Parents describe

wanting to do their best at their job because they care about being a

role model, to illustrate the value of a strong work ethic, or to teach their

children positive career strategies—like Serena Williams’ desire to show

her daughters how to embrace diﬀerent interests across careers. These

dynamics emerged in qualitative interviews researchers conducted in

South Asia to explore the nature of family motivation further. One

employee said: “My kids are everything to me. I want to give them

the best and also want to be [a] role model for them. I want to teach

them that one should [honor] their responsibility and earn a respectable

living.”

Work can also be a source of pride, as employees share their

accomplishments to make family members proud. As another South

Asian employee shared, “My family feels pride in my work, my earning

capabilities, and my growth in my career. It is the encouragement and

backing from my family that motivate me to grow.” Just as Serena

Williams looked forward to her daughter watching her work, these

employees delighted in seeing the pride in their accomplishments

reﬂected in their families’ eyes.

Family can also give employees a bigger-picture perspective that

can help them to overcome challenges at work. For instance, Mark

Buckingham, a physiotherapist who worked with athletes as they

became new parents, noted: “Babies put a bad day or a poor

training session into context. Oddly, they make athletes better at time
