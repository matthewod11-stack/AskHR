# 2 EXPLORING EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS IN SEARCH FUND–ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

especially when compounded by additional obligations like accrued benefits. If that same employee had 80 hours of unused vacation time at an hourly rate of $25, the company would owe another $2,000—costs that are often overlooked when managers consider termination as a solution.5

Beyond severance and benefits, compliance with laws like COBRA* adds another layer of complexity. Companies with 20 or more employees are required to offer former employees continued health insurance coverage, a process that demands administrative oversight and resources.6 Employees have 60 days to enroll in COBRA, and while COBRA is temporary, in most circumstances, former employees can stay on COBRA for 18 to 36 months. While the former employee typically pays the premiums, managing compliance can strain smaller HR departments that are already juggling multiple responsibilities.7 For companies unprepared for these obligations, even the smallest misstep can create unnecessary expenses or legal complications.

Then, there is the potential for legal disputes,8 which are among the most daunting aspects of termination. Defending against claims of wrongful termination—even when the employer ultimately prevails—can cost tens of thousands of dollars and absorb significant time and energy. Beyond the legal fees, there are administrative costs tied to the termination process itself, from processing final paychecks to updating internal records. Each step requires careful attention, further straining already stretched teams.

However, the impact of firing does not end with dollars and logistics. The emotional and cultural toll on the workplace can be equally damaging. The departure of a colleague, particularly one who may have worked closely with others for years, often leaves teams feeling unsettled. Productivity can dip as remaining employees absorb the emotional weight of the decision and grapple with fears about their own job security. Over time, these factors can erode trust in leadership, creating a workplace where employees feel disengaged and less willing to take creative risks.9

Replacing the terminated employee brings additional costs. Recruitment and onboarding are not just time- consuming—they are expensive. According to estimates from the Society for Human Resource Management, it can cost six to nine months of an employee’s salary to find and train their replacement. For a $60,000-a-year position, that is an investment of $30,000 to $45,000.10 Yet even these numbers fail to account for the loss of institutional knowledge that leaves with the departing employee. Such losses can disrupt workflows, hinder innovation, and leave organizations scrambling to regain their footing.11

Poorly managed terminations can also have lasting cultural consequences. A company that regularly cycles through employees or mishandles dismissals sends a powerful, if unintentional, message to its workforce: You are expendable. This sentiment can drive talented employees to seek opportunities elsewhere, further compounding turnover and making it harder to build a cohesive, motivated team. Employees who stay often grow cautious and become reluctant to take risks or innovate out of fear of making mistakes that could jeopardize their positions.

All told, firing an employee should not be taken frivolously and should be perceived as a final step when rehabilitation and corrective actions have failed. It is not a simple process and there are material quantitative and qualitative costs to consider. In other words, the bar for a separation needs to be pretty high.
