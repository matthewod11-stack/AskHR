organizations are eliminating perfect-attendance incentives out of a concern that such programs might violate the Family Medical Leave Act (Tyler, ).

Discipline for Not Attending Absenteeism can be reduced by punishing or disciplining employees who miss work. Discipline can range from giving a warning or a less popular work assign- ment to firing an employee. As shown in Tables . and ., discipline works fairly well, especially when combined with some positive reinforcement for attending.

Clear Policies and Better Record Keeping Another way to increase the negative consequences of missing work is through policy and record keeping. Most organizations measure absenteeism by counting the number of days missed, or frequency. Perhaps a better method would be to record the number of instances of absenteeism rather than the number of days. For example, instead of giving employees  days of sick leave, they are given three or four instances of absenteeism. Missing one day or three consecutive days each counts as one instance of absenteeism.

As shown in Figure ., the number of days missed and the instances of absenteeism often yield different results. By decreasing the number of times that a person can miss work, the odds increase that the employee will use sick leave only for actual illness. These odds can further be increased by requiring a doctor’s excuse for missing a certain number of consecutive days.

Absenteeism can be decreased by setting attendance goals and by provid- ing feedback on how well the employees are reaching those goals. An interesting study by Harrison and Shaffer () found that almost % of employees think their attendance is above average and estimate the typical absenteeism of their coworkers at a level two times higher than the actual figures. Similar results were found by Johns (). Thus, one reason employees miss work is that they incor- rectly believe their attendance is at a higher level than their coworkers’. Providing feedback to employees about their absenteeism levels may be one way to reduce absenteeism.
