## 7.2.6 Firms May Be Biased in Judging the Cause of Performance

In the standard agency model laid out above, agents exert effort which is productive, but principals can only observe agents’ output. Observed output depends on unob-

This simple assumption buries a lot of behavioral economics. Separating skill

from luck is difficult. As a result, it is quite possible that psychological forces bias

principals’ judgments of whether output is due to skill or luck. Three important

psychological forces suggest that separating hard work from luck will often be

biased in predictable ways: hindsight bias; overattributing cause to personal traits
