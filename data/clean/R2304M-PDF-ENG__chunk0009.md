# Runway Isn’t Everything

After Louis made his pitch at the board meeting, Tyler asked for a

couple of weeks to study the workforce and burn rate numbers and

report back. A few days later he met with Simone Ward, Puck’s chief

people oﬃcer.

“Before we discuss more layoﬀs, let’s look at where things stand

now,” Simone said, tilting her screen toward Tyler. “This is the latest

employee engagement survey.” One chart showed that the percentage

of employees who “rarely think about looking for a job at another

company” had dropped from 57% (well above the average at peer

companies) to 42% (below average). Another showed a 10% drop in

employees who said, “I see myself working here in two years.”
