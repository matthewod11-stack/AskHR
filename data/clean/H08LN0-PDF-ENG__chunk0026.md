## Policymakers: Use effective tax policies.

Exorbitant pay for CEOs and other top executives can be controlled

if an eﬀective tax policy is introduced to curtail “excessive” executive

pay beyond the values these executives bring to the ﬁrm. In addition,

another incentive may be introduced for tax cuts for those ﬁrms who

treat their employees better. For instance, if the average employee pay is

increased substantively, tax cuts may be provided to incentivize ﬁrms.

. . .

As we’ve seen in the past few decades, extreme pay disparities

and imbalances in treatment of external stakeholders can have

unintended and damaging consequences for organizations. CEOs,

boards of directors, and policymakers must take proactive steps to

address these inequities. Doing so is not just a matter of ethics

but also a pragmatic strategy for fostering trust, loyalty, and long-

term organizational success. By fostering a fairer and more equitable

organizational environment, companies can align their values with

their actions, ensuring a sustainable future for all stakeholders.
