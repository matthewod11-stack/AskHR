# regulation on the mine bulletin board.

Section 109(a) of the Mine Act requires a mine operator to maintain at each mine an oﬃce with a conspicuous

sign designating it as the oﬃce of such mine. In addition, a mine operator must maintain a bulletin board at

the mine oﬃce or at a conspicuous place near an entrance of the mine and must post and protect from damage and unauthorized removal orders, citations, notices and decisions required by law or regulation to be

posted.

In addition to the Mine Act posting requirements, several MSHA standards and regulations require mine

operators to post notices or warnings. These requirements can be found here.
