## HBR / Digital Article / The Art of Setting Expectations as a Project Manager

“I need to make it very clear that certain things will only be possible

if pieces fall into place as anticipated,” says Sandy Binjour, a senior

project manager at a global advertising agency. “At the 11th hour, if things are still oﬀ the rails, it’s time to have a candid yet collaborative

conversation that gets everyone to weigh in on the decision that needs

to be made.”

To foster that collaboration and manage the expectations of key

stakeholders prone to making unrealistic demands, Hecht suggests

trying this script. “I hear that you want X, and we can deliver X to a

point.” Clearly and candidly state how far you can go. Then, ask how the team can work together to come up with a diﬀerent solution so everyone

feels like they are co-creating the new path forward, even as folks are

dealing with high stress and strong emotions.
