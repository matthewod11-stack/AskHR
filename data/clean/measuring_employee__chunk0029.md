# Engagement via the NHS Staff Survey

NHS Employers state that (cid:515)acting on staff experience information collected from the NHS staff survey is important for delivering improvements for staff and patients(cid:516) (NHS Employers, 2013). And as Steve Trenchard, Chief Executive of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust notes:

(cid:515)The important task is to be able to demonstrate to our workforce that the ‚Äùoard is taking palpable steps to improve the conditions in which we work. It(cid:514)s a bit like a large-scale (cid:515)You Said We Did(cid:516) exercise. Having specific feedback for individual professional groups, or service lines, helps us to triangulate other information to ensure we provide the best support and workforce interventions to colleagues in times of challenge, change and improvement.(cid:516)

Therefore, every Trust should develop an (cid:513)engagement strategy(cid:514) that links with their overall workforce strategy, and is supported by senior management and the Chief Executive. Effort should be made to involve various staff groups (e.g. operational managers and clinicians) when developing and implementing such a strategy.

The results from the NHS staff survey should be carefully examined. Many of the key factors that influence engagement are assessed by the survey. By identifying which areas need improving, which groups of workers are particularly vulnerable, and which areas are particularly strong the Trust can develop an overall strategy based on reliable evidence.

The NHS staff survey measures a vast range of work-related perceptions, from aspects of physical safety to personal development to relationships with line management. This may make it difficult for Trusts to identify particular areas on which to focus a strategy, especially when limited budgets and resources make such strategic decisions even more important. Trusts must identify the areas which have the most potential to raise engagement scores (i.e. motivation, involvement and advocacy) significantly and directly, and are most likely to be cost-effective and efficient to implement. Preliminary findings from the NIHR evidence synthesis (Truss et al, forthcoming) highlight the following areas are most likely to help foster
