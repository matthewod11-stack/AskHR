# engagement.

Two of us (Lopata and Gotian) have both spent many years working with

large organizations and have found that many employees are unaware

of the presence of mentoring programs, how to access them, or even if

they qualify. Many employees would have welcomed the opportunity to

beneﬁt from a guide through the next stage of their career but simply

didn’t realize the support was there for them. Others would have been

delighted to mentor but were never asked.

These are simple obstacles that can be ﬁxed with relative ease.
