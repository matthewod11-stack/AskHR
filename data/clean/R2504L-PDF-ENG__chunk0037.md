meantime, companies can take partial measures, such as having diﬀering anchor days for various teams or invoking rules that focus on

relationship-building with geographically dispersed employees.

experienced mentors to show them the ropes. Create a list of important

people whom new hires should meet and send introductions to make

sure that those meetings happen.

are now—is also vitally important. So map out the groups that have

critical interactions with one another, and as a start, bring them

together for a series of working lunches, two groups at a time. Plan the

seating to mix up team members. Use the working part of the lunch

to identify what the groups need from each other, discuss the most
