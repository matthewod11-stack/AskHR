## HBR / Digital Article / How to Lead Across a Siloed Organization

Given our work with senior leaders and their increasing angst at

trying to get things done cross functionally, we set out to better

understand how great leaders navigate these challenges to drive results.

We interviewed dozens of senior leaders (VP level and above) who were

nominated by their organizations as individuals who could get things

done across the business without damaging relationships along the way.

Through our interviews, we found very clear and distinct patterns for

how leaders do this well. Speciﬁcally, we found there are particular

mindsets, skills, and practices top-performing leaders use to lead cross-

enterprise eﬀorts and achieve signiﬁcant outcomes for the organization.

We also found that leaders feel ill-equipped in how to lead across. Their

experience and development is in traditional vertical leadership (i.e.,

managing their own teams), but not in getting things done with peers

who have diﬀerent agendas, priorities, and motivations. The skillsets

are not the same.
