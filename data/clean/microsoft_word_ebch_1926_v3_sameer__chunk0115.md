requirements. A person's current organisational position and desired future position are taken into account when determining a training need. The knowledge gap, skill gap, and attitude gap are typically considered separately. The programmes' primary goal is to increase employees' performance at work. Individuals must enhance their knowledge, skills, and attitudes in order to achieve this goal. These must be in line with the organization's aims and objectives.

Training Plan: There are several elements in the training plan that must be taken into account. The importance of content knowledge cannot be overstated. It contains the knowledge and details that must be taught to the students. Another consideration is the training program's scheduling and length, or how long it must be practised. It is required to provide goods and equipment. For instance, in certain programmes, learners do not need to bring their own materials because they are given by the organisations. If kids need to use technology for studying, they could include stationary goods or even computers. Resource and investment planning is another area of the utmost importance. What is the organization's budget for starting the programme?

Implementation of Training: When putting training into practise, a number of factors need to be taken into account, such as how the policies, procedures, norms, and values are documented; how the trainer applies the training techniques; the ideal environment for the organisation of training; how the trainees' tasks are covered during the training; and how well-adjusted they are. In some instances, the jobs are challenging, and people lack the necessary understanding to carry out their duties. The program's execution must take into account the trainees' ability to learn effectively, advance their knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and improve their performance on the job. Programmes should take place in a friendly setting with appropriate communication amongst the participants.

Training Evaluation: Finding programme limits and making improvements are the key goals of evaluation. For instance, when employees are unable to increase productivity and encounter issues with their performance, it shows that programmes have not been able to appropriately improve their skills and talents. When an evaluation is conducted, reactions, learning, behaviour, and findings must all be taken into account. Most often, after the programmes are over, the trainees use the survey approach to assess the performance of the instructors. These are determined by their instructional techniques, knowledge, abilities, attitudes, communication skills, approachability, ability to solve difficulties, and overall programme execution.
