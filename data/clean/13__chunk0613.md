members were allocated greater levels of outcomes by the Polynesian children than by the European children. The behavior of the Asian children was no doubt based on cultural norms and values that stress collectivism, generosity, equality, and the maximization of the collective good (Kitayama, Markus, Matsumoto, & Norasakkunkit, 1997; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).

Effect of Treatment of the Target on the Cultures of Ingroups and Outgroups Our SIO model assumes that the treatment of stigmatized targets leads to number of important consequences (e.g., Arrows 22 and 23). Among these are (a) enhancing the power and esteem of the ingroup, (b) decreasing the power and esteem of the outgroup, (c) reinforcing the negative stereotypes that ingroup members have of outgroup members, (d) reinforcing the outgroup’s negative views of justifying the way that themselves, outgroup members are treated in a social system, and (f) diminishing the motivation of outgroup members to remain in the social system. In view of this, it is important to consider strategies for reducing the problems caused by stigmas and stigmatization.

Interventions to Reduce Stigmatization and Associated Problems We believe that an understanding of the cultural, cognitive, and emotional underpinnings of SIO should prove quite useful in identifying strategies for overcoming unfair discrimination against stigmatized people in organiza- tions. Several strategies for doing this are brieﬂy considered below.

Changing Societal Norms. The stigmatization of individuals and the treatment of them depends on social system norms about various factors (e.g., VSIs). Thus, one means of reducing stigma-related problems would be to have educational institutions work toward changing such norms (e.g., by socializing people to value the beneﬁts of a pluralistic society). Another would involve having organizations work with the media to portray members of stigmatized groups in favorable ways. For example, Fortune magazine often showcases the accomplishments of their top managers who are black or female. Nevertheless, our advocacy of these practices should not be viewed as inconsistent with the need for legislation to reduce the unfair treatment experienced by members of stigmatized groups (e.g., Civil Rights Act, 1964; Americans With Disabilities Act, 1990).

Changing Organizational Cultures. The plight of stigmatized individuals might also be improved through several organizational changes that are
