# Social Contact

The most robust ﬁnding in the literature on the effects of happi- ness and well-being is that happy people enjoy, feel more conﬁdent in, and even attract social contact. This should make happy work- ers perform better in jobs that require social contact. Customer service jobs, sales jobs, and other occupations in which employees deal directly with customers and the general public will beneﬁt from the happy worker’s greater likeability and greater social com- petence. In addition, occupations that rely on teamwork and co- operation may beneﬁt from employees with higher levels of positive affect. But because positive affect will likely increase em- ployees’ desire for social contact, greater positive affect may be detrimental in jobs where too much social contact is distracting and unproductive.
