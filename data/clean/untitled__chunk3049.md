# National Psychological Associations 545

During the 1930s, several states began certiﬁcation programs for school psychologists (Fagan, Hensley, & Delugach, 1986; French, 1984). Anumber of those psycholo- gists belonged to the ACP and then the AAAP. One of the charter divisions of the reorganized APA was Division 16, School Psychology. However, many school psychologists did not qualify for membership in Division 16 because they did not have a doctoral degree. Historically, school psychology has been dominated by nondoctoral professionals (Fagan, 1996). Growth of Division 16 membership was steady but slow, even though the number of school psychologists was expanding rapidly. By the 1960s, it became clear that Divi- sion 16 was not responding adequately to the needs of nondoctoral school psychologists. As a result, a need for a na- tional organization that could represent all school psycholo- gists led to the founding of the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) in 1969 (Fagan, 1996).

Membership rose steadily from the founding of the NASP and stood at 21,000 plus in 2000. The association devel- oped an impressive track record of working to raise educa- tional and training standards. Accreditation of training programs became an important part of the NASP’s work as well (Fagan, Gorin, & Tharinger, 2000).

Applied psychological organizations proliferated in the last decades of the twentieth century. Space does not allow for all of them to be described. A few chosen to serve as ex- amples include the American Association of Correctional Psychologists (founded 1953), the International Society of Sport Psychology (founded 1965), theAssociation for theAd- vancement of BehaviorTherapy (founded 1966), theAssocia- tionforAppliedPsychophysiologyandBiofeedback(founded 1969), and the Society of Psychologists in Management (founded 1984). Hundreds of other applied psychological or- ganizations had been established in the United States alone by the end of the twentieth century (see VandenBos, 1989).
