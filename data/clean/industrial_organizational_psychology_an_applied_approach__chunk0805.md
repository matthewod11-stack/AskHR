limit, segregate, or classify employees or applicants for employment in any way that would deprive, or tend to deprive, any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his stature as an employee because of an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

Unlike the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Civil Rights Acts do not require that the employment practice discriminate intentionally to be deemed as potentially illegal. Instead, proof of discrimination is determined through statisti- cal analysis of selection rates and by the presence or absence of adverse impact, which will be discussed in detail later in the chapter.

The Civil Rights Acts have also been interpreted by the courts to cover the “atmosphere” of an organization, which includes such behavior as sexual harass- ment (Broderick v. Ruder, ; Brundy v. Jackson, ), age harassment (Louis v. Federal Prison Industries, ), race harassment (Hunter v. Allis-Chalmers, ), and religious harassment (Abramson v. William Patterson College of New Jersey, ).

An interesting example of courts considering the atmosphere of the organi- zation is the case of Forbes v. ABM Industries (). Cheryl Forbes was a top- producing manager who accused the company of using subtle political ploys to create an atmosphere in which women could not be successful. Some of these ploys included area managers going to dinner with male managers but not with female managers, employees being encouraged to bypass female managers and go directly to their subordinates, and rumors being started about female managers. The jury found in favor of Forbes, and a Washington State appeals court upheld the jury award of over $ million for sexual discrimination and harassment.

Color Also protected by the Civil Rights Acts is color. Though commonly used as a synonym for race, the reference to color protects individuals against discrimi- nation based specifically on variations in skin color. For example, in the  case of Walker v. Secretary of the Treasury, a district court found that a darker- skinned African American supervisor at the Internal Revenue Service illegally fired a lighter-skinned African American employee. In a similar case, Applebee’s Neighborhood Bar and Grill paid a $, settlement to a dark-skinned African American employee who complained that his lighter-skinned African American manager made disparaging remarks about his skin color (Mirza, ).

Sex The Civil Rights Acts, as well as the Equal Pay Act of , prohibit discrimina- tion based on sex. The courts have ruled that intentional discrimination against either women or men is illegal (Diaz v. Pan American Airways, ). The courts are split on the legality of discrimination against transsexuals, as one court has ruled such discrimination legal (Sommers v. Budget Marketing, ), whereas the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled it illegal (Barnes v. City of Cincinnati, ; Jimmie L. Smith v. City of Salem, Ohio, ).

National Origin National origin is protected under the Civil Rights Acts. Note that Hispanics are protected under national origin, not race. Claims of discrimination based on national origin have increased greatly over the past few years. One of the most

common complaints is about “English only” or “understandable English” speak- ing requirements. The courts have generally ruled that language requirements are legal if they are job related (Quinn & Petrick, ) and limited to communi- cation during “company time” rather than on breaks.

A good example of an illegal “English only” language requirement was in the case that resulted in a $. million settlement between the EEOC and Colorado Central Station Casino in . The casino required employees to always speak English, even during private conversations between two employees. To “encour- age” employees to speak English, managers and other employees would yell, “English, English, English” at any employee speaking Spanish. Such harassment caused great embarrassment to the employees.

Religion Also protected under the Civil Rights Acts is religion. It is illegal to use an indi- vidual’s religion as a factor in an employment decision unless the nature of the job is religious. For example, the Catholic church can require its priests to be Catholic but cannot require this of its clerical staff. The Civil Rights Acts also require organizations to make accommodations for religious beliefs unless to do so would be an undue hardship. The accommodation failures most cited in the , complaints of religious discrimination filed annually with the EEOC are those involving days of worship, worship practices, and religious attire.

Days of Worship. Many religions forbid their members from working on particular days. For example, Seventh-day Adventists and Orthodox Jews cannot work from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, and members of the Greek Orthodox church cannot work on Sunday. Such nonwork requirements should not be confused with preferences for nonwork on days of worship (e.g., Protestants working on Sunday or Christmas; attending a morning rather than an evening worship service), as the courts have ruled that an employee’s preference does not need to be accommo- dated (Dachman v. Shalala, ; Tiano v. Dillard Department Stores, ).

Days of worship are often easily accommodated by scheduling employ- ees without religious restrictions to work on those days. When there are only a few employees, scheduling rotations can be used to reduce, but not eliminate, the number of days of worship that an employee might have to miss. Accom- modations become legally unreasonable when there are no coworkers available, overtime will have to be paid to cover an employee’s day of worship, or another employee’s seniority or collective bargaining rights have been violated. However, with a little ingenuity and proper explanations of an employee’s religious require- ments, reasonable accommodations can usually be made.

The case of Eddie Kilgore provides an example of a poorly handled case of religious accommodation. Kilgore had been employed for  years by Sparks Regional Medical Center in Arkansas when he was suddenly ordered to be on call on Saturdays. As a Seventh-day Adventist, he was forbidden to work on Sat- urdays, a requirement long known by his employer. When Kilgore refused the Saturday work, he was fired. Kilgore filed a suit for religious discrimination and a jury awarded him $, and his former job back.

Worship Practices. Two practices in particular can cause potential problems: prayer and fasting. Some religions require members to pray at certain times. For example, followers of Islam perform the Salat ritual prayer five times daily: at sunrise, noon, afternoon, sunset, and night. Because each prayer can take  minutes (includ- ing preparation such as hand washing), such organizations as fast-food restaurants
