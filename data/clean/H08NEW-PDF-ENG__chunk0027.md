Get ahead of future pay gaps by ensuring that new hires (and

internal promotions) get unbiased starting salaries (which can be

making ad hoc adjustments in a data-informed manner that ensures

internal consistency with similarly situated employees. These days,

sophisticated but user-friendly software exists to help with this process.
