## more collaborative, but for remote employees, solo entrepreneurs, or

members of the gig economy, it is non-negotiable to success. Couple

that with the challenges of a hybrid or remote work environment, and it is the diﬀerence between being considered for an opportunity, ruled

out, or completely forgotten.

When I left my 17-year corporate career at a luxury brand to pursue

consulting, I went from being a member of a large corporate oﬃce

to working remotely and independently. Without my executive title

and the credibility of being employed by a well-known retail group, I

could only lean on myself when pursuing new business. My nearly two

decades of accrued social capital bolstered my ability to have my calls

returned and my emails responded to.

I understood the value of staying connected to my network and showing

a genuine interest in their careers while sharing my future ambitions for

consulting projects. I checked in on important contacts to inquire how

they were and what they were working on during a time when I didn’t

need to ask for anything. I sought them out on social media to amplify

and support their content shares and to keep my name top of mind.
