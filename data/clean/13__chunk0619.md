# NOTES

- 1. We use the term culture to refer to both cultures and subcultures. This avoids

the need to repeatedly use the phrase ‘‘cultures and subcultures.’’

- 2. We recognize that in any social system there may be only a single dominant group. However, in order to simplify wording we use the term groups in place of the phrase ‘‘dominant group or groups.’’

- 3. Organizations have such properties as norms and values because there is a consensus (at least among the regnant organizational members) about various issues. In arguing that there is such a consensus we are not attempting to reify organizations.
