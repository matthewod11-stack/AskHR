# CONCLUSIONS

Consistent with research in a number of disciplines, our SIO model considers the antecedents and consequences of stigmatization in organiza- tional settings. An important contribution of the same model is its joint consideration of cultural, cognitive, and emotional factors associated with stigmatization. We hope that it serves to generate much needed research on stigmatization in organizational contexts, and motivate HRM-related changes that will reduce the many problems that stigmatized individuals face in such contexts.
