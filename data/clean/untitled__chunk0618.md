# 106 Sensation and Perception

Figure 5.3 A square and a triangle appear as a function of the operation of the gestalt principle of perceptual organization labeled closure.

qualities as the squareness or triangularity that you see in Figure 5.3 represented failures in correspondence between the physical array and the conscious perception. For this rea- son they tended to classify such perceptual-grouping phe- nomena as errors in judgment analogous the visual-geometric illusions that we saw in Figure 5.2. They argued that it was just as illusory to see a set of dots cohering together to form a square as in Figure 5.3, when in fact there are no physical stimuli linking them, as it is to see two lines as different in length when in fact they are physically identical.

The gestalt theorists set out to attack this position with a theoretical article by Köhler (1913). This paper attacked the prevailing constancy hypothesis that maintained that every aspect of the conscious representation of a stimulus must cor- respond to some simple physical stimulus element. He ar- gued that many nonillusory percepts, such as the perceptual constancies, do not perfectly correlate with the input stimu- lus. Perceptual organizational effects fall into the same class of phenomena. He argued that to label such percepts as “illu- sions” constitutes a form of “explaining away.” He goes on to say, “One is satisﬁed as soon as the blame for the illusion so to speak, is shifted from the sensations, and a resolute inves- tigation of the primary causes of the illusion is usually not undertaken” (Köhler, 1913, p. 30). He contended that illusory phenomena are simply viewed as curiosities that do not war- rant serious systematic study. As he noted, “each science has a sort of attic into which things are almost automatically pushed that cannot be used at the moment, that do not ﬁt, or that no one wants to investigate at the moment,” (p. 53). His intention was to assure that the gestalt organizational phe- nomena would not end up in the “attic” with illusions. His arguments were clearly successful, since few if any contem- porary psychologists would be so brash as to refer to gestalt organizations in perception as illusions, despite the fact that there is now evidence that the very act of organizing the percept does distort the metric of the surrounding perceived

space in much the same way that the conﬁgurational elements in Figure 5.2 distort the metric of the test elements (see Coren & Girgus, 1980).
