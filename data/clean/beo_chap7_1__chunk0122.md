# CHAPTER SEVEN

rational CEOs of Forbes 500 companies should therefore try to diversify their per-

sonal portfolios whenever possible. For example, CEOs should exercise their stock

options after the vesting period, if the stock price went up by enough, and should sell company stock following a regular (precommitted) schedule.‚Äù* But some CEOs

do exactly the opposite, holding options that are well in the money (far above their

exercise price) and buying, rather than selling, company stock (half the CEOs who

do this lose money). In fact, during recent corporate scandals, while exorbitant

pay, forgiven loans, and accounting manipulations grabbed public attention, it was

less noticeable that many of the apparently guilty executives truly believed in the

potential of their firms and their industry. The former CEO of WorldCom, Bernard

Ebbers, lost millions of dollars because his private portfolio was narrowly invested in telecommunication stocks, while doing one merger after another.

Managerial overconfidence thus has the potential to explain the big puzzle implied

by $2 trillion spent on acquisitions by U.S. firms between 1998 and 2001, of which

$250 billion was lost by shareholders of the acquiring companies (Moeller et al.

2003).

The same holds for internal investment projects. While it is hard to measure

whether internal investments are generally bad bets (such data are rarely available),

itis easy to find examples. Roger Smith, the former CEO of General Motors, became

convinced that fully robotized plants, with no human presence, are the future of auto-

mobile production. His vision led to massive firings at GM and triggered negative

responses from business analysts and engineers alike because they did not believe

the technology was advanced enough. Such concerns did not stop a visionary like

Smith. The result was plants in which

the robots often began dismembering each other, smashing cars, spraying paint

everywhere or even fitting the wrong equipment.
