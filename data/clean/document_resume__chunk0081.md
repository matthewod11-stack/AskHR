hiLh performance ratings may be used The first deals with an individual's ad\ anvement ;11 the organizational struc- ture. Examples include faculty member to depaitment chair, library teLhnician to assistant librari 111, and comptroller to business manager. Job behavior and activities are often more revealing than tests and inter\ tews for predivting, future performance. Thus, positive performance ratings often are used as promotion criteria.
