SDS is a manual that instructs respondents not only in how to self-administer the test but also in how to interpret the results for themselves. Although in actual practice SDS results are typically reviewed with an assessment professional, the self- interpretation guidelines have the advantage of enriching a respondentâ€™s engagement in and understanding of a voca- tional counseling process.
