# THOMAS A. WRIGHT AND RUSSELL CROPANZANO

similarly shared by a number of other early researchers, including Eberle (1919) and Snow (1923). In particular, Eberle (1919) wrote about the relevance of ‘‘general’’ employee satisfactions, while Snow (1923) emphasized the role of ‘‘mental alertness’’ in employee decisions to withdraw.

During the Second World War, when issues surrounding employee retention decisions gained added prominence because of the shortage of civilian workers, Bender (1944) went so far as to propose that 60% of all job dissatisfaction was directly attributable to issues of employee well-being. In other words, those employees experiencing low emotional well-being were seen as more likely to be dissatisﬁed. Apparently far ahead of their time, a number of early organizational scholars were interested in not only the psychological determinants of employee well-being, but also the possible physiological or genetic determinants of well-being as well (Hersey, 1929; 1932a; 1932b; Mayo, 1933).
