# HBR / Digital Article / Is Your Organizational Transformation Veering Off Course?

This is the internal and external context in which turning points

happen, and 80% of executives we surveyed agreed that how they

navigate a turning point — and how early they intervene — can

determine whether the overall transformation continues to stagnate or

if it accelerates performance and improves the outcome. Our research

found successfully navigating a turning point means the transformation

program is 1.9 times more likely to overperform its target KPIs.
