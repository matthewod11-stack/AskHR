# formal PIP.

You’ve provided the right resources and parameters for success.

Be sure that you have addressed factors beyond the employee’s

control that might have contributed to their performance failures. Were

there unclear expectations, unmanageable workloads, training gaps, or insuﬃcient resources for the person to succeed? If so, pinning a PIP on

the employee is not legitimate. Address the enabling factors ﬁrst.

You’ve already addressed any extenuating circumstances.

Have you taken any personal or health challenges into account? When

you provided negative feedback about their work, did they share

any extenuating circumstances that might explain why they haven’t

performed up to standard? If so, you might want to focus on what

support you, your team, or your organization could provide to help the

employee rather than triggering a PIP process. Ultimately, if the person

can’t do their work, you might choose to go the formal route.
