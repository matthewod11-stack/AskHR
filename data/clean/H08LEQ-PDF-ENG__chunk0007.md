## 3 Areas Where AI Will Be Game-Changing for Business

Built on the foundation of IT and digitization, the AI revolution is

transcending limitations in at least three highly consequential areas

for business: 1) enabling continuous enterprise reinvention instead

of periodic transformation, 2) using real-time intelligence instead

of depending on episodically-updated software, and 3) synthesizing

multiple modes of data instead of being restricted to a single type

of input like text only or visual only. Today, leading companies are

leveraging these game-changing attributes of AI into strategies that

separate them from their competitors and, along the way, redeÔ¨Åne how

humans and machines work together.
