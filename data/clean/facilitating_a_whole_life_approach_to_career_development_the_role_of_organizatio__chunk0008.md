# Incorporating Whole-Life Considerations Into Conceptualizations of Career Development

Economic and societal changes in the United States have contributed to the evolution of career paths and perspectives on career development. Faced with global competition, organizations have become leaner and flatter with fewer hierarchical levels (Hall, 1996). Rather than ascending upward through linear trajectories within a single organization, some employees now pursue multidirectional career paths across numerous organizations to realize objective (e.g., promotions and pay increases) and sub- jective (e.g., career and life satisfaction) career success (Arthur, Khapova, & Wilderom, 2005). As such, the influence of nonwork domains (family and personal life) has become integrated progressively into the career development literature (Greenhaus & Kossek, 2014; Hall & Mirvis, 1996; Sullivan & Arthur, 2006). There is increasing recognition that contemporary career paths vary in form, at least in part, because individual career patterns are shaped by employee decisions made in response to non- work circumstances (Greenhaus & Kossek, 2014; Valcour et al., 2007). This section outlines the evo- lution of employee career orientations and conceptualizations of career development as illustrated in the research literature.
