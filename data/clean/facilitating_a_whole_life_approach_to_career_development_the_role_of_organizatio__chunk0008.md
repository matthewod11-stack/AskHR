# Litano and Major

Many contemporary career theories have emphasized individual responsibility for career develop- ment, highlighting interorganizational mobility as the primary mechanism for achieving career goals (e.g., Hall & Mirvis, 1996; Sullivan & Arthur, 2006). However, the best organizations recognize the advantages associated with being an active partner in managing employees’ career development and in addressing their work–life needs (Clarke, 2013). Research suggests that opportunity for work–life bal- ance is an important career priority, for both women and men (Vandello, Hettinger, Bosson, & Siddiqi, 2013).

In the sections that follow, we first trace the evolution of employee career orientations and concep- tualizations of career development in the academic literature, demonstrating how it has increasingly incorporated the employee’s personal and family roles. Next, we elaborate on the whole-life approach to career development. We emphasize the role that organizational leadership plays in facilitating employees’ whole-life career development through support for work–life balance. The roles of upper level executives and frontline supervisors are considered, as is the importance of alignment across lev- els of organizational leadership. Finally, we discuss the competitive advantages that the whole-life approach to career development may yield for organizations.
