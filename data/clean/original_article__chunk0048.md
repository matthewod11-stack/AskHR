# levels of cultural intelligence quotient (CQ) increase Team Task Performance (TTP).

The most recent conceptual framework in the stream of board research has been the use of behavioral theory – the ‘interactions and beha- vioral processes among and between actors in and around the boardroom’ (Van Ees et al, 2009). Van Ees et al (2009) further suggest that studying boards from a behavioral perspective adds more value than using the traditional economic frameworks, as using behavioral the- ory brings us closer to what is actually happen- ing in the boardroom, and this is more actionable for practitioners. In fact, beyond the simple exchange of information, ‘the focus on how boards add value has increased the relative importance of practices that facilitate boards working together well as a group’ (Payne et al, 2009). Perhaps the the most scholars contributing to this stream of literature are Huse and colleagues in their pronounce- ment that to unravel the mystery of the board we should ‘… emphasize how the board, [works] as a team together and rather than only as individual board members … [and how they] can effectively coordinate ﬁrm activities and utilize different resources to create value. As no board member is the full complement of information and knowledge necessary to achieve desired goals, then work- ing as a team permits greater productivity than can be achieved by individual efforts’ (Gabrielsson et al, 2007). To best observe the behaviors that represent this concept, we need to understand different aspects of board perfor- mance ranging from how directors perform as a team, to how well directors are able to respond
