## During the three-year period between 1987 and 1990, a NYSE electronics

company made an order-of-magnitude improvement in quality and on-

time delivery performance. The outgoing defect rate dropped from 500

parts per million to 50, on-time delivery improved from 70% to 96%, and

yield jumped from 26% to 51%. Did these breakthrough improvements

in quality, productivity, and customer service provide substantial

beneﬁts to the company? Unfortunately not. During the same three-

year period, the company’s ﬁnancial results showed little improvement,

and its stock price plummeted to one-third of its July 1987 value. The

considerable improvements in manufacturing capabilities had not been

translated into increased proﬁtability. Slow releases of new products

and a failure to expand marketing to new and perhaps more demanding

customers prevented the company from realizing the beneﬁts of its

manufacturing achievements. The operational achievements were real,

but the company had failed to capitalize on them.
