# Research Findings

A meta-analysis by Mount et al. (1998) examined relationships be- tween Five-Factor Model (FFM) traits and overall job performance in a team environment. We found Agreeableness to have the strong- est relationship ((cid:1) = .33), followed by Emotional Stability ((cid:1) = .27), Extraversion ((cid:1) = .22), Conscientiousness ((cid:1) = .21), and Openness to Experience ((cid:1) = .16). We also examined relationships with a more speciﬁc performance criterion of how well the team mem- bers interacted with others. The results were similar: the strongest relationship was for Agreeableness ((cid:1) = .35), followed by Emotional Stability ((cid:1) = .25), Conscientiousness ((cid:1) = .17), Extraversion ((cid:1) = .16), and Openness to Experience ((cid:1) = .07). Neuman and Wright (1999) found Agreeableness and Conscientiousness to pre- dict peer ratings of individual performance beyond job-speciﬁc skills and general cognitive ability. Agreeableness thus appears to be a particularly important predictor of individual performance in team settings, which is somewhat counter to ﬁndings in settings that do not involve extensive teamwork (Barrick, Mount, & Judge, 2001). The impact of Emotional Stability and Extraversion on in- dividual performance also appears to be magniﬁed in some team settings.

Why are some traits linked more strongly to performance in team settings? Barry and Stewart (1997) found social inputs to me- diate the relationship between Extraversion and peer ratings from teammates. Stewart, Fulmer, and Barrick (2002) also explored this question by examining relationships between FFM traits and team
