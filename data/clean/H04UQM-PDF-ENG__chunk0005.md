For advocates of paternity leave, recent years have brought some good

news. High-proﬁle companies like Amazon, Netﬂix, and Microsoft have

created or expanded their programs. Twenty-nine percent of organizations

now offer some paid leave for fathers, up from 21% a few years ago,

according to the Society for Human Resource Management. And steadily,

more states are creating paid family leave insurance programs, which

include leave for new fathers.
