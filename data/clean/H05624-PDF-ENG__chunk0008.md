When I came back to the company in 2014, after stepping back from

a full-time executive role for several years, we had no HR. Katelin

Holloway was willing to come on as head of people and culture, and she

brought with her a plan, including paid leave, and I thought it seemed

reasonable. Within the tech industry, 16 weeks of leave is table stakes.

But that speaks to an important issue. Tech companies have these

beneﬁts because we’re in a war for talent. The reason tech companies

are able to grow hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and billion-

dollar valuations is because they’re attracting and retaining people

who are high performers. I’m proud that tech is on the frontline of

supporting paid leave. And it should be a bellwether for other industries

that want top talent, especially with technology skills. You’re going to

have to attract them by oﬀering as much or better.
