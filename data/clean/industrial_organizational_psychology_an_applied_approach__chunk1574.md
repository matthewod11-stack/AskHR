## Step : Determine the Reason for Evaluating Employee Performance

The first step in the performance appraisal process is to determine the reasons your organization wants to evaluate employee performance. That is, does the organization want to use the results to improve performance? Give raises on the basis of performance? This determination is important because the various performance appraisal techniques are appropriate for some purposes but not for others. For example, a performance appraisal method—the forced-choice rating scale—(see appendix at the end of the chapter) is excellent for determining com- pensation but terrible for training purposes. Likewise, the use of -degree feedback is an excellent source for improving employee performance but is not appropriate for determining salary increases. Surprisingly, most organizations do not have specific goals for their performance appraisal systems. As a result, it comes as no surprise that several national surveys found that the vast majority of performance appraisal systems are not successful (Coens & Jenkins, ).

Though there are many uses and goals for performance appraisal, the most common include providing employee feedback and training, determining salary increases, making promotion decisions, making termination decisions, and conducting personnel research.
