# Providing Employee Training and Feedback

By far, the most important use of performance evaluation is to improve employee performance by providing feedback about what employees are doing right and wrong. Even though employee training should be an ongoing process (see Chapter ï™€), the semiannual performance appraisal review is an excellent time to meet with employees to discuss their strengths and weaknesses. But more impor- tant, it is the time to determine how weaknesses can be corrected. This process is thoroughly discussed later in the chapter.
