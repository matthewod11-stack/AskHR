# move into as an obstacle to mobility.

Crisscrossing the organization as a lattice can also create a more inclusive

culture and improve diversity. Cliques and insider versus outsider feelings

are minimized when movement is plentiful. It also helps retain diverse

talent who might otherwise get discouraged about slow-to-open senior

roles if mobility is only viewed as upward.

Get comfortable with change. One last reason talent mobility often

doesn’t take hold: it requires frequent change. While most companies

discovered the importance of agility during the pandemic, top companies

have always recognized its importance. If employees describe change as

overwhelming, wearing them down, or destabilizing to what they do

normally, it’s likely they are working within a low-performance

organization. Employees at top-performing companies are not only more

likely to say change is normal and in fact part of the business model, but

they usually describe it as an opportunity. Several of these organizations

even induce change on a regular basis under the theory that consistent

change actually boosts productivity.
