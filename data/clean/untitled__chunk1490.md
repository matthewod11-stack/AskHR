# Frameworks for Studying Women and Gender

Inspired by Woolley’s work, Leta Stetter Hollingworth of- fered a rebuttal of the variability hypothesis, the belief that males were the more variable sex and thus responsible for the evolutionary progress of the human species (Hollingworth, 1914, 1916). Hollingworth argued against the claim that women’s genetic makeup made them less likely than men to be highly creative or intelligent (Shields, 1975). Woolley and Hollingworth pioneered the use of empirical research to chal- lenge assertions about women’s natural limitations. The re- search and theory they developed was necessarily reactive rather than proactive. That is, they worked to refute claims about female inferiority that they themselves did not origi- nate. Because their ability and their very right to do research and develop theory were in doubt, they were able to gain credibility only insofar as they addressed the questions posed by the psychological establishment.

Few women of this era gained access to positions at re- search universities or funds for research, and few were able to train graduate students who might have spread their ideas or continued in their footsteps (Rosenberg, 1982). By the 1920s, there was no longer an active women’s movement to lend political support to their ideas. Therefore, ﬁrst- wave feminism had no lasting impact on psychology. Most of the “foremothers” of feminist psychology remained un- known until second-wave feminist psychologists reclaimed the early history of women in psychology (Bernstein & Russo, 1974).

Opportunities for women remained limited during the in- terwar years (Morawski & Agronick, 1991). Women were channeled into applied ﬁelds, especially those connected with children. Women in academia often held adjunct status or unstable research positions. An important response to women’s secondary status in psychology was the founding of the National Council of Women Psychologists in 1941, which we describe later.

An even greater resistance to women in the professions marked the decades following World War II. This resis- tance was part of the broad cultural pressure on women to have large families and to engage in full-time homemaking. The number of women professionals declined during the 1940s and 1950s. Indeed, many social critics and mental health professionals pressed women into domestic roles by a variety of dubious pronouncements issued under the guise of science. For example, they blamed mothers for a variety of psychological disorders, behavior problems, and social ills in their children (Caplan & Hall-MacCorquodale, 1985). They extolled marriage, motherhood, and subordination to men’s interests as criteria of maturity and fulﬁllment for women. Nonetheless, there were resisters like Karen Horney, Clara Thompson, and Georgene Seward.
