## recruitment for similar positions in the organization.

The notice must include the statement that an application has been ﬁled under the program; address of the appropriate DOL

oﬃcer to whom the application sent; and information in the job advertisements including wage rate and job description.

Labor certiﬁcation process. The Department of Labor processes applications for Alien Employment Certiﬁcation (ETA Form 9089). The date the labor certiﬁcation application is ﬁled is known as the ﬁling date and is used by USCIS and the U.S.

Department of State as the priority date for visa issuance. After the labor certiﬁcation application is approved by the Department

of Labor, it should be submitted to the USCIS service center with an I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. You may access

the State Department Visa Bulletin(http://travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html) to learn which priority dates are currently

being processed.

Records. The employer is required to retain documentation supporting the application for ﬁve years from the date of ﬁling the

Application for Permanent Employment Certiﬁcation. This documentation varies depending on the type of application ﬁled (for a

professional, a non-professional position, or for a college or university professor engaged from a competitive recruitment process)

but generally includes recruitment documentation, including information regarding the number of potential U.S. applicants and the

reasons for rejection of these workers. The SWA prevailing wage determination documentation is not submitted with the application, but it must be retained for ﬁve years from the date the employer ﬁles the application.

There are no reporting requirements.

If possible fraud or willful misrepresentation involving a labor certiﬁcation is discovered before a ﬁnal labor certiﬁcation

determination, ETA will refer the matter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for investigation. In addition, ETA can take

steps to revoke an approved labor certiﬁcation if ETA ﬁnds the certiﬁcation was not justiﬁed, including if fraud or willful

misrepresentation is discovered, and the employer, attorney, and/or agent can be barred from ﬁling applications for up to three years. Additionally, DHS or the Department of State may invalidate a labor certiﬁcation if the agency determines there has been

fraud or willful misrepresentation involving the labor certiﬁcation. Finally, if the Department learns that an employer, attorney, or

agent is involved in possible fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with the permanent labor certiﬁcation program, the

Department will refer the matter to the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, or other government entity, as

appropriate, for investigation, and send a copy of the referral to the Department of Labor's Oﬃce of Inspector General.
