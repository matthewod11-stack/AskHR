## “OK, Boomer,” “Gen X cynics,” “entitled Millennials,” and “Gen Z

snowﬂakes.” We have become so entrenched in generational name-

calling — or, conversely, so focused on downplaying the diﬀerences

that do exist — that we have forgotten there is strength in age diversity.

Especially at a time when we are wrestling with so many changes to the

way we work, it’s incumbent on leaders to embrace intergenerational

teams as a key piece of the DEI puzzle and to frame them as an

opportunity to be seized rather than a threat to be managed.
