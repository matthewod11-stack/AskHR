## The Happy/Productive Worker Thesis Revisited

elemental to many theories of motivation is that humans seek what is pleasurable and avoid what is painful (e.g., Sullivan, 1989). Historically, this viewpoint was well articulated by the principles of utilitarianism and its best-known proponent, John Stuart Mill, who formulated the greatest happiness principle. That is, and simply stated, always act so as to produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people (Velasquez, 2002). Certainly happiness, as deﬁned here, is considered by many to be highly valuable, but oftentimes it is scarce as well (Wright, 2005). Just how scarce is happiness? An increasing number of researchers have suggested many Americans are not truly happy (cf., Myers & Diener, 1997; Wright & Cropanzano, 2000). This concern gains a measure of credibility when one considers that while the adjusted value of after-tax income at least doubled between 1960 and 1990, the percentage of Americans who report themselves as ‘‘very happy’’ remained constant at only 30% (Myers, 1993, pp. 41–42). Certainly this inherent value placed on happiness, coupled with its relative scarcity, highlights the importance of conserving, maintaining, or, even better, enhancing one’s happiness (Hobfoll, 1988, 1989, 1998).
