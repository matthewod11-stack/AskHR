- 1. Facilitate adaptive learning. As part of the team development plan, team mem- bers can be encouraged to try new behaviors. Also, as the team completes work or a specific project, changes that were made in processes can be reviewed in detail to understand what worked and what did not.

- 2. Facilitate generative learning. Teams can be given information regarding best practices implemented by other teams in the same organization or even in other organizations. Teams can be given time to practice new skills until they become habitual.

- 3. Facilitate transformative learning. Teams can be encouraged to experiment with new ways of working together, including a discussion of feelings of uncertainty when facing change. Members from other teams can be invited to participate in discussions about performance or even to work as team members temporarily as a way of importing innovation and change into the team.
