that people have an inherent need to feel good about themselves, and this is the reason why they are so concerned about self-esteem. According to the theory, self-esteem observes interactions between people and sends signals to the person to keep him/her aware of how socially acceptable his/her behaviour is. The way people perceive gender inequality in society is not likely to have a great impact on self-esteem since it is not considered to be a personal matter, and people cannot directly contribute to its disappearance. However, when people perceive the existence of gender inequality in their own workplaces, they might feel a threat to their social acceptability. In other words, since social acceptance has a profound influence on individuals’ overall opinions of themselves and their overall well being, it is convenient for them to deny the existence of gender inequality in their workplaces in order to protect their self-esteem and minimize the chances of their rejection in the society. All in all, based on the above-mentioned theories, people are suggested to perceive gender inequality in society in general but to see it as ‘something beside the point of the organization’ (Acker, 2006a: 452).
