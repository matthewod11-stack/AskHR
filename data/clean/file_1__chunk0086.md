# 2.4.1. Perceptions of gender inequality

Considerable prior empirical research has found that people generally see gender inequality as existing somewhere else, not where they are (Acker, 2006a, 1991; Benschop and Doorewaard, 1998; Ely and Meyerson, 2000; Gill, 2002; Heiskanen and Räsänen, 1997; Kelan, 2009; Korvajärvi, 2003, 1998; Lewis, 2006; Rantalaiho, 1997).

Several social psychological theories are relevant in underlying why people tend to perceive gender inequality in the society in general, but not or less in their workplaces. First of all, cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957) is relevant in explaining why consciousness of gender inequality tends to disappear as long as it concerns concrete individuals. The concept of cognitive dissonance, which refers to an uncomfortable feeling caused by holding conflicting ideas simultaneously, is the core element of the theory. According to the theory, people have a motivational subconscious drive to reduce dissonance by adjusting their attitudes, beliefs and/or actions. In line with the theory, people may believe that there is gender inequality somewhere in the society where they live but reject its existence in their own workplace. This belief may or may not be true, but it reduces dissonance and makes people feel better. Thus, by preventing the identification of gender inequality in their workplaces as a personal matter, people protect their private self-concept.

Secondly, attribution theory (Weiner, 1980, 1992) might be relevant in underlying why individuals tend to acknowledge gender inequality in society but reject its existence in their workplaces. According to the theory, people are strongly motivated by the pleasant outcome of being able to feel good about themselves. People thus tend to interpret their environment and events happening there in such a way as to maintain a positive self-image. Correspondingly, people are likely to perceive gender inequality in society since they may attribute it to factors over which they have no control such as discrimination and traditional labour segregation. However, when they are asked whether gender inequality persists in their workplaces, they may deny its existence, because workplace inequality could be attributed to their own efforts and abilities, and the confirmation of its existence would lead them to feel less good about themselves.

Finally, sociometer theory (Leary, 1999) is applicable for explaining the phenomenon of gender inequality disappearance. Similar to attribution theory, sociometer theory assumes
