## uncomfortable questions during executive town halls—on camera, with

no pre-screening. Within three quarters, internal trust scores rose 32%.

Employees said they didn’t just feel heard—they saw that being heard

made a diﬀerence.

The takeaway is simple but often overlooked: people speak when it’s

safe, when it matters, and when speaking leads to change. Culture isn’t

built by soliciting feedback—it’s built by how leaders respond when that

feedback is hard to hear.

Too often, silence is misread as consensus. But in high-power-distance

cultures, silence is more likely to signal disengagement, fear, or learned

helplessness. Real alignment starts with acknowledging that people

won’t raise the hard stuﬀ unless you actively make room for it—and

protect them when they do.
