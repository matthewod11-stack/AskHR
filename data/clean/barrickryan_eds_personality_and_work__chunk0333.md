# Proposed Model of the Relationship Between Personality and Individual Performance

A proposed model of pathways by which individual differences in a personality variable inﬂuence individual performance on a given performance component is presented in Figure 4.1. This model is compatible with those of Campbell et al. (1993) and Motowidlo et al. (1997) and adds elements to both. Consistent with Campbell et al., performance on any particular job performance component is a function of declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and skill, and motivation. One difference is the expanded conceptual- ization of motivation. Another is the addition of a fourth determi- nant, work habits, in recognition of the possibility that job-relevant behavior can occur automatically despite motivation to behave oth- erwise. Work habits also inﬂuence performance indirectly by in- ﬂuencing the need for and choice of self-regulatory strategies. For simplicity, the only indirect determinants included are personality variables and ability variables. This model could be expanded to
