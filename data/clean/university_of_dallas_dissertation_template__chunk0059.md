Chapter three is divided into ten sections, identifying the methodological choices

used to test the hypothesized relationships in this study. The first section provides an

overview of the expected research design. The second section discusses data collection,

including data sample, data analysis method selection, and sample size requirements. The

third section discusses the survey design used. The fourth section explains informed

consent and screening. The fifth section discusses BOT Checks, Instructional

Manipulation Checks (IMCs), and attention checks. The sixth section explains the
