## TRANSITING THE MODERN TO POSTMODERN ERA 239 REFERENCES 242

of the social world as, for example, Edward Ross’s (1901) Social Control, William I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki’s (1920), The Polish Peasant in Europe and America, George Herbert Mead’s (1934) Mind, Self, and Society, and William James’s (1890) Principles of Psychology. With an even more comprehensive gaze, historians also need to register more recent “extracurricular” social psychology, which includes texts as wide ranging as Richard Sennet’s (1974) Fall of Pub- lic Man, Betty Friedan’s (1963) The Feminine Mystique, and Lewis Thomas’s (1974) Lives of a Cell. On another plane, that of discipline boundaries, historical accounting must measure social psychology’s multiplicity: its nascent emer- gence across the social sciences and its eventual blossoming in sociology and psychology (Karpf, 1934; Loy, 1976). This prospective inclusive history would consider, too, the numer- ous blueprints for systematic theory, including pragmatism, behaviorism, psychoanalysis, cognition, discourse, symbolic interaction, social learning, evolution, phenomenology, dra- maturgy, balance, and gestalt. In one sense this would yield a historical telling that reverberates with setting the distinctly psychological terms of modernity, principally the discipline’s detection and naming of what comes to be taken as the “psy- chological” in the social life of Americans. In another sense social psychology’s story, broadly told, would contribute to explicating late-twentieth-century America’s shift from be- lief in a distinctly modern individual to a postmodern subject.
