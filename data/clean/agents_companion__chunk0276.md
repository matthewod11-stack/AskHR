## specifications, practical advice, and conceptual explanations)

- 2. No single agent has complete information to fully address the user's needs

- 3. The user would benefit from multiple perspectives on the same question

- 4. Different specialized agents have access to distinct knowledge bases or

reasoning capabilities

Unlike the competitive approach where responses compete, the collaborative pattern

assumes that responses from different agents are complementary rather than redundant.

The Response Mixer Agent identifies the most valuable information from each source and

synthesizes it into a cohesive answer that leverages the unique strengths of each specialist.

For example, when asked about handling hydroplaning, the Car Manual Agent contributes

vehicle-specific safety system information, the Driving Tips Agent provides practical driving

techniques, and the General Knowledge Agent explains the physics behind the phenomenon.

Together, they create a more complete and useful response than any single agent could

provide alone.
