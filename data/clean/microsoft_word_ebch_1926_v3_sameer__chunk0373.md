## The Historical Evolution of Occupational Health and Safety

The concept of Occupational Health and Safety has evolved significantly over the centuries. In the past, the safety of workers was often overlooked, leading to numerous workplace accidents and health hazards. With the advent of industrialization in the 18th and 19th centuries, the need for systematic safety measures became apparent. However, it was only in the 20th century that OHS began to be recognized as a formal discipline. The early 20th century saw the establishment of the first laws and regulations pertaining to workplace safety, particularly in industries like mining and manufacturing. These regulations aimed to reduce accidents, injuries, and diseases arising from work-related activities. Gradually, OHS standards improved, leading to a decline in workplace fatalities [5], [6].
