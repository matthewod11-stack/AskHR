# Ecosystems of Autonomous Agents

Completing some tasks requires more than a single agent. In those

cases companies may custom-build a system of agents wherein each

one is expert in a speciﬁc task. Take the mortgage-underwriting process.

When a human underwriter provides the instruction “Review this

loan application based on our company’s lending policies,” one agent

might extract relevant information from the application. Another agent

might act as a librarian of bank policies, making them available to

agents that compare the application against them. Yet another agent

might generate a ﬁnal report, recommending a course of action to the

underwriter considering the loan. A “connector” agent might oversee

and orchestrate the activity of all these agents.

Combining multiple agents and allowing them to communicate and

collaborate with one another is critical to the development of AI systems

that can autonomously manage end-to-end processes. Such solutions

could transform entire functions like supply chain management,

production, and marketing. At ﬁrst glance, this might seem to be

about achieving automation on a huge scale (and more fuel for sci-ﬁ

fantasists fearing world domination by AI). But the real story here is the
