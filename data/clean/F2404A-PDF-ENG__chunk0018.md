## HBR / Magazine Article / Why Entrepreneurs Should Think Like Scientists

Reﬁne your theories and test them again—but more broadly. When

Mimoto found that its theory wasn’t feasible, it developed a new

theory involving young professionals. But it didn’t assume the new

theory would work in the real world just because it had worked in an

experiment. Mimoto tested it by placing dozens of mopeds in urban environments. It reapplied the scientiﬁc method to its new theory until it was conﬁdent it had found a viable solution.

“Entrepreneurs who adopt the scientiﬁc method are not visionaries.

They’re aware that their theories may be wrong. And when they’re

wrong, they modify their theories, which they test again. If no theories

are successful, they terminate the start-up,” says Gambardella.

Even if you end up shutting down a business, don’t worry. “Failing a few

times is a recipe for future success,” Gambardella says.
