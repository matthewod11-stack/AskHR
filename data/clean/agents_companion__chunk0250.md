User: "How do I turn off the lane-keeping assist feature in this Volkswagen?"

Car Manual Agent: "To turn off lane-keeping assist in your Volkswagen, press the

button with the car-and-lane icon located on the left side of your steering wheel. You'll

see a confirmation in the driver display when it's deactivated. You can also disable

it permanently in the infotainment system under Settings > Driver Assistance > Lane

Keeping. Would you like me to walk you through the settings menu instead?"
