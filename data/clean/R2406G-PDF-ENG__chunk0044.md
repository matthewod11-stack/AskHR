## and number of products in those sectors, all of which enable companies

to collect more data in less time. Although companies in more

highly regulated industries, such as insurance, ﬁnancial services, and

healthcare, tend to score lower on the index, some ﬁrms in those sectors

Advanced personalization generates lots of revenue. Companies that

put personalization and AI at the center of their customer strategy

are growing 10 percentage points faster than personalization laggards

and six points faster than companies on average (see the exhibit

“Better Personalization Leads to Faster Growth”). The data shows that

personalization leaders have more digital customer relationships, and

their customers spend 30% more than customers as a whole in their

category. The root cause of this diﬀerence is that their customers engage

three times as often (not just by transacting but also pre- and post-

purchase) as do the customers of their competitors. As a result, the

leading companies generate more data and insights on which to base

future personalized interactions.
