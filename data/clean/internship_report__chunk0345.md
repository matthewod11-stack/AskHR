# I. Suspension

Suspension of an employee, during the course of his service simply means that no work is to be

taken from him during the period of suspension. The employee does not work on a post in this

period. If he is actually discharging the duty of a certain office prior to suspension, the order of

suspension would mean that he would cease to work on and discharge the duties of that.
