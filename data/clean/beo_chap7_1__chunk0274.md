# valuation of wages.

In my view, this oscillation among frameworks embodied in the essay accurately

mirrors the state of the field. Across the social sciences, the working assumptions

about the human mind that have relied on metaphors of computation are contending

with metaphors of biological process. The “deviations” perspective exemplifies the

older approach, with roots stretching back to Herbert Simon’s bounded rationality

and his models of heuristic human problem solving that rest in turn on his symbol

processing hypotheses. Although Simon and his followers engaged in some bitter

contests with orthodox economists, both camps worked with a view centered on a

strongly cognitive approach to human decision-making. Both presumed that much

of what was important about choice and problem solving was accessible for research

31 The essay by Colin Camerer and Ulrike Malmendier on “Behavioral Economics of Organizations” included in the present volume reflects not only the stimulating presentation at the conference, but also the

lively discussion that followed, and it embodies further valuable work done subsequently by the authors.

Similarly, this commentary contains material from remarks made at the conference, but also responds both

to the following discussions and to the revisions made in the Camerer~Malmender article. By now both

documents are well-removed from being transcripts of the original sessions. I have, however, retained the

title of the conference remarks, which was chosen with the aim of being somewhat provocative. Despite

many changes, that remains my goal, as I believe that a period of important change is underway in this

field, and I hope to accelerate it.
