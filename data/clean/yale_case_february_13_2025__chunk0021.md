# Legal considerations

Employment laws in the U.S. establish critical boundaries for termination decisions. While most states operate under “at-will” employment,40 allowing terminations without specific cause, federal protections such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibit terminations based on discrimination or retaliation. It is essential to ensure that every termination is supported by a legitimate, documented reason that complies with these protections. This not only reduces exposure to legal claims but also demonstrates a commitment to ethical practices.41
