# 12 EXPLORING EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS IN SEARCH FUND–ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

Thorough documentation serves as a vital safeguard against wrongful termination claims. Performance- related records should focus on objective, behavior-based criteria, such as unmet targets or failure to fulfill the terms of a PIP. Consistency in recordkeeping across employees in similar roles is key to demonstrating fairness and avoiding allegations of disparate treatment. Objective documentation ensures that termination decisions are defensible and equitable.

Separation agreements and employee releases provide an additional layer of protection for organizations. These agreements typically offer severance or other benefits in exchange for the employee waiving certain legal claims. To be effective, separation agreements must use clear, straightforward language and be in compliance with state and local employment law requirements. Confidentiality and non-disparagement clauses are ideally introduced in employee handbooks (and often further formalized in stand-alone agreements) and can help protect the company’s reputation and sensitive information. If such documents are not signed upon hiring, it is important that any separation agreement or employee release include these conditions. A well-structured agreement can prevent prolonged disputes and foster a smoother transition, benefiting both the organization and the departing employee.42

Protected status claims require particular attention, as they are often context sensitive. Courts evaluate factors such as managerial behaviors and team dynamics to determine whether discrimination has occurred. Terminating an employee soon after they have filed a discrimination or harassment complaint can lead to claims of retaliation. Generally, waiting at least 90–120 days (if possible) or having clear documentation justifying performance-related concerns helps reduce legal exposure. Consistency in applying standards across all employees and maintaining impartial documentation is critical to minimizing the risk of such claims.

Improper terminations can lead to significant financial and operational risks, with legal disputes potentially costing thousands to millions of dollars depending on liability and case complexity. Beyond monetary costs, litigation disrupts operations and damages organizational morale.43 By carefully considering legal requirements, documenting decisions thoroughly, and offering structured support through tools like separation agreements, organizations can approach terminations with professionalism and integrity. This approach not only reduces legal exposure but also reflects a commitment to fairness and respect for all employees.

A mini-profile: a search fund entrepreneur managing employee terminations

John Yanchek is the CEO of Montis Financial, where he manages with a focus on conscious leadership, culture building, and operational excellence. After graduating from Middlebury College and spending nearly a decade in investment banking and private equity, Yanchek launched his search fund in February 2020. In December 2021, he and his partner acquired Montis Financial and began the task of transitioning Montis from a lifestyle practice into a high-performing business. This transformation was no small feat. It involved significant top-grading of the inherited team, implementing the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), and establishing clear mission, vision, and values to get traction and accountability in the business. Given the legacy lifestyle orientation, many employees struggled to align with the company’s new direction, requiring a significant number of terminations and reassignments during the first two years.
