# CHAPTER SEVEN

attention paid to behavioral ideas. This is surprising because it has been argued that

large stock markets are the ultimate domain in which highly rational traders should

limit the influence of those who make mistakes. So why did academic asset pricers

start to “misbehave” so fast? One reason was good data, which made it easy to test

new behavioral theories against the rational incumbents. Another reason was the

availability of a clear benchmark model (market efficiency) to argue with. Good

data and a sharp benchmark enabled researchers to create a set of clear anomalies in

asset pricing. The situation was reversed in corporate finance. Rational arbitrageurs

cannot easily limit suboptimal corporate-finance decisions, since it is hard to short-

sell a CEO or CFO. Quite the opposite occurs: top executives may be entrenched

and hard to get rid of. Biases and mistakes in decision-making are thus much more

likely to have a persistent and large effect in corporate finance than on asset pricing.

Nevertheless, behavioral research in corporate finance took off considerably later

than that in asset pricing, possibly due to the lack of good data and a clear theoretical

benchmark. Obtaining executive-level or even firm-level data on corporate finance

decision-making has always been more intricate than obtaining stock price data.

At the same time, numerous, conflicting theories have been proposed for virtually
