## HBR / Digital Article / Is Office Politics a White Man’s Game?

argues that women prefer work environments that foster cooperation,

teamwork, and support. Creating cooperative rather than competitive

environments will allow more women to thrive. This was further

supported by research undertaken by Accenture, which found 14 factors

that contribute to creating cultures of equality, and these fell into three

key areas: making diversity a top leadership priority, including men in

diversity initiatives, and ensuring employees feel comfortable creating,

innovating, and being themselves at work. In these environments

women are four times more likely, and men are twice as likely, to

rise to senior management positions. It seems that creating work

environments that are less competitive and more cooperative serves to

beneﬁt us all. Oﬃce politics may be a white man’s game, but it is a game

that beneﬁts only some white men.

One barrier to creating a more equitable system for everyone may be the

leaders in charge today. These leaders not only set the political norms

but also help create and maintain the political environment that favors

them at the disadvantage of everyone else. Creating cooperative work

environments is one way to ﬁx this, but that can only be achieved if

today’s existing leaders are willing to give up the game.
