One popular strategy to preserve worker safety is implementing a

hotline that workers use to register complaints. But too often, hotlines

go unused, not because employees don’t have grievances, but because

employees don’t trust them — a lose-lose for employer and employee

alike. Employees need mechanisms to keep themselves safe, and

employers need a healthy and engaged workforce.
