# Picture-Story Methods

During the mid-1930s, Henry Murray (1893–1988), a psy- choanalytically trained physician with a doctorate in bio- chemistry who was then serving as director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic, formulated a theory of personality that stressed the role of idiographic needs and attitudes in deter- mining individual differences in human behavior. In collabo- ration with Christiana Morgan, Murray also considered the possibility of identifying needs and attitudes, especially those that people were reluctant to admit or unable to recognize, by examining the fantasies they produced when asked to tell stories about pictures they were shown. These notions led to a seminal article about picture-story methods of studying fan- tasy (Morgan & Murray, 1935), a classic and highly inﬂuen- tial book called Explorations in Personality (Murray, 1938), and eventually the publication of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) (Murray, 1943/1971).

To the extent that the content of imagined stories can pro- vide clues to a respondent’s inner life, TAT data are expected to shed light on the particular hierarchy of a person’s needs and the nature of his or her underlying conﬂicts, concerns, and interpersonal attitudes. As was the case for the inkblot method following Rorschach, Murray’s picture-story method gave rise to numerous systems of coding and interpretation. The approaches that became most commonly employed in clinical practice were variations of an “inspection technique” proposed by Leopold Bellak that consists of reading through respondents’storiestoidentifyrepetitivethemesandrecurring elements that appear to fall together in meaningful ways (see Bellak&Abrams,1997).Thepopularityofsuchastrictlyqual- itativeanduncodedapproachtoTATdatahaslimitedeffortsto demonstrate the psychometric soundness of the instrument or to develop a substantial normative database for it.

On the other hand, several quantiﬁed TAT scales designed to measure speciﬁc personality characteristics for clinical or research purposes have shown that the instrument can gener- ate reliable and valid ﬁndings when it is used in a standard- ized manner. Three noteworthy cases in point are scoring systems developed by McClelland, Atkinson, and their col- leagues to measure needs for achievement, afﬁliation, and power (Atkinson & Feather, 1966; McClelland, Atkinson, Clark, & Lowell, 1953); a defense preference scale devel- oped by Cramer (1999); and a measure of capacity for adap- tive interpersonal relationships, the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (SCORS) developed by Westen, Lohr, Silk, Kerber, and Goodrich (1985).
