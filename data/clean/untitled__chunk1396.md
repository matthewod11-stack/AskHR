# Crisis—What Crisis?

These criticisms of social psychology’s individualistic thesis and nonsense laboratory groups combined with ﬁerce debate about social psychology’s laboratory uses of deception and its positivist scientiﬁc practices for a full blown disciplinary self-analysis—or crisis of knowledge in social psychology, as it has come to be known. For some, social psychology’s lab- oratory of “zany manipulations,” “trickery,” or “clever exper- imentation” was regarded as ensuring the “history of social psychology . . . [would] be written in terms not of interlock- ing communities but of ghost towns” (Ring, 1967, p. 120; see also, for example, Kelman, 1967; Rubin, 1983). For others, experimental artifacts appeared almost impossible to contain as the laboratory increasingly revealed itself as a site wherein social psychological meanings were as likely to be created in situ as to reveal wider general laws of individual and social life (Suls & Rosnow, 1988; also see Rosenzweig, 1933). In a wider sense, the ﬁeld was regarded as having gone through several phases of development as a science to arrive at what Kurt Back (1963) identiﬁed as a “unique position” of being able to encompass a “social psychology of knowledge as a legitimate division of social psychology,” which would take into account “the problem of the scientist, of his shifting direction, his relation to the trends of the science and of soci- ety, and his assessment of his own efforts is itself a topic of social psychology” (p. 368).
