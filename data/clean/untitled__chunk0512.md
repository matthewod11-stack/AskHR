# Personnel

Most critical was the availability of personnel. With stable positions, most of the prewar generation of comparative psy- chologists were able to develop active laboratories and pro- duce a continued output of research. As universities grew and fellowships became available, this generation, in turn, produced a new generation of comparative psychologists. In 40 years at the University of Wisconsin, Harlow alone

supervised 35 PhDs, including such names as Abraham Maslow, Donald R. Meyer, John M. Warren, Gerald E. McClearn, Allen M. Schrier, Leonard A. Rosenblum, and Stephen J. Suomi (Suomi & Leroy, 1982). During his career, Beach supervised 41 predoctoral and postdoctoral students (McGill, Dewsbury, & Sachs, 1978). Schneirla left a legacy of inﬂuential students including Daniel S. Lehrman, Jay S. Rosenblatt, and Ethel Tobach. Similar programs were devel- oped elsewhere. Then, of course, these students found jobs, built laboratories, and began educating yet another genera- tion. Comparative psychology still had a problem in that many who published animal research early in their careers left to become prominent in other ﬁelds of psychology. Ex- amples include Maslow, William Bevan, Jerome S. Bruner, William K. Estes, Eugene Galanter, Eleanor J. Gibson, Jerome Kagan, Quinn McNemar, M. Brewster Smith, and Dael L. Wolﬂe. Comparative psychology was always a small part of the big picture of American psychology. Nevertheless, there was a solid cadre of comparative psychologists carrying on the tradition.
