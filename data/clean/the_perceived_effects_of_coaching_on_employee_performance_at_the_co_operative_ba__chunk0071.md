## individual awareness and understanding of their own aspirations, their current

situation and beliefs, the possibilities and resources open to them and finally the

actions they want to take to achieve their personal and professional goals.

In the first stage, the skilled coach invites the employee to identify what he sees as

the key goals for the planning period for instance six months. The goals should be

selected within the broad context of the organization and departmental goals and

should be framed to reflect what the employee feels will be possible to deliver. The

goals may initially be expressed as end results. The coach asks questions to raise

awareness not to criticize or challenge. If the goals first selected are vague, hard to

measure or completely unrelated to the job, then the coach will seek clarification

(Whitmore, 1992). Organizations that simply have a well-defined purpose are more

likely to report coaching success than those organizations that aren’t sure what their

purposes in coaching are. According to Collins (2001) in the management Good to

Great, improvements in both leadership development and retention rates are

essential in getting the “right people on the bus,” which is a consistent precursor to

improvements in gaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Stone (2007)

notes that heightened productivity is one of several benefits attained through

coaching interventions.

The second stage is to raise the employee self-awareness of all the factors

underlying and surrounding present performance against the goal (Robinson, 2006).

The employee will rate themselves in relation to the goals and determine whether

the set goals are realistic. This will trigger the employee to realize the factors that

have been preventing progress.

With the goal and reality understood by the employee, the coach help the employee

determine what they can do. This is aimed at helping the employee generate as many

ideas as possible without evaluating them in any way yet.

Once the employee is satisfied with the number of options the coach can ask how

the options will be evaluated. The coach and the employee will agree who will write

up the key points especially the goal and the action plan for both parties. There

doesn’t appear to be a universal methodology for evaluating coaching benefits

(Leedham, 2005). Of the existing coaching evaluation methods, some are based

purely on the perception of the recipient, which can be an unreliable gauge. The

most prevalent method used to evaluate coaching is soliciting the coachee’s reaction

to the service through a self-report. Sometimes a second level of evaluation is added

through ratings completed by others during and after coaching. What are usually

missing, however, are measures of behavioral changes brought on by coaching.

These can be determined by obtaining ratings by team or peers over a one- to three-

month period of time. An even higher level of evaluation can be attained by

measuring the impact of coaching on the organization or business. Data such as sales

increases, retention, satisfaction, promotion, and so forth, are generally required to

(cid:49)(cid:53)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

do this and must be done over a much longer time frame such as one to two years

(MacKie, 2007).

The implementation of the GROW Model, by using carefully structured questions,

promotes a deeper awareness and responsibility and encourages proactive behavior,

as well as resulting in practical techniques to accomplish goals and overcome

obstacles. The use of continuous and progressive coaching skills support provides

the structure which ultimately helps to unlock an individual’s true potential by

increasing confidence and motivation, leading to both short- and long-term benefits.

The GROW Model has been seen to yield higher productivity, improved

communication, better interpersonal relationships and a better quality working
