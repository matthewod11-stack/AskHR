## “digital public good” AI models—publicly accessible rails on which

applications are built. For instance, the Digital Public Goods Alliance,

a multi-stakeholder initiative, promotes open-source software, open

data, open AI models, and open content collections that adhere to

promotes a “tiered openness” model, which allows varying levels of

access to diﬀerent AI components.
