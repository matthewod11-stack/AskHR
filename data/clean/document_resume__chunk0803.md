During the past ten years, community college administrators !lace been forced to deal with a comple.c array of problems pnncipally associated with a shifting emphasis from growth to quality. Consequently, the challenges facing college administrators today hate never been greater. Faced with declining or fluctuating enrollment patterns, diminishing financial increasing expenditures associated with rapidly advancing technological changes, and pressing needs to provide a significant leadership role in economic development activit:es, community colleges are being asked to accomplish more with less with greater efficiency and effectiveness. As a result, insti- tutions must implement management systems and parameters which pros ide for greater accountability through effective planning, managing, and evaluating.]

resources,

Accountability is not a fad or "buzz." word that is going to fade away. Elected offi- cials at all levels, as well as their constituents, are demanding increased focus upon what is necessary, valuable, and productive. The focus and growing pressure on public institutions for greater accountability has resulted in an ever- increasing emphasis to examine more closely the quality of institutional programs and serch. es. However, institutions cannot be held accountable, only individuals. Thus,. growing numbers of states are requiring some form ut serious performance appraisal strategy for public education employees.

Since accountability is an issue that is here to stay, the time has arrived for the community college leaders of this country to take a serious appro ich to developing effective, periodic, systematic, and comprehensive appraisal programs. Such programs must be based on clearly articulated criteria and must be legally defensible. Further, the appraisal process should take a positive approach as a professional development aide. No one employee should be excused, and no one should be treated differently.

The major reason for performance appraisal focuses on its use as an important tool in building institutional e \cellence and accountability. This would seem to be reason enough. It is not, considering the ideal of self regulation. Do we want to maintain the prerogative of managing this activity or do we \Amu someone to do it for us or to us?
