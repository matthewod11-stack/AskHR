# HBR / Digital Article / Remote Work Has Opened the Door to a New Approach to Hiring

important variables that companies should weigh before deciding how

to utilize open/ﬂexible talent.

For one, the level of ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge required for a project

will typically tip the balance between insiders and outsiders. While

freelancers can build complex database-driven web applications from

scratch — perhaps more eﬃciently than the internal employees of many ﬁrms — a project that requires interfacing eﬀectively with existing

applications that require signiﬁcant ﬁrm-speciﬁc context will mean

either: a) an internal employee is needed to form the bridge; b) the

freelancer must learn the internal systems (potentially at higher cost

than an internal employee); or c) an internal employee will serve an

integration role that builds on the freelancer’s work.

Then there’s the question of whether a project or task is recurring.

All hiring and onboarding has some costs — whether screening a

freelancer, setting up a contest, or hiring a full-time role. If a project

or task is going to be repeated over time, the scale tips toward making

a more permanent hire to economize on these costs, especially if they

involve training a new hire on ﬁrm-speciﬁc processes. On the other

hand, a repeated task can be suitable for open talent if it involves

common skills and requires little ﬁrm-speciﬁc context.

Finally, there are integration costs of incorporating work from an open

talent solution into the larger organization. These tend to be low for

projects that require little ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge and can be very high
