# we here?”

For many top teams, a lack of discipline, particularly in managing

meetings, can be at the core of problems. Meetings are a mainspring in team eﬀectiveness because they create the time and space for eﬀective traits and behaviors to ﬂourish. But getting meetings right

is deceptively diﬃcult, often because team members don’t appreciate

their importance to business performance and thus fail to give them

their due focus. To get the most out of meetings, each team member

must be disciplined in properly preparing for, participating in, and

following up after them. At Root, Foote and the COO introduced a seemingly simple procedural shift that had an outsize eﬀect: They

stopped cochairing meetings and deputized team members to preside over them instead. The eﬀect was to distribute leadership among the

members, giving the whole team a greater sense of shared ownership.

The new regime sharpened the team’s decision-making discipline and

produced better alignment between decisions and strategy.
