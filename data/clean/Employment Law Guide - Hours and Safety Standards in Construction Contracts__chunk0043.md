# withholding of liquidated damages.

Workers have rights of action and/or of intervention against the contractor and its sureties if the amounts

withheld are insuï¬ƒcient to reimburse the unpaid wages. Under such an action, it is no defense that workers accepted less than the required rate of wages or voluntarily returned wage payments to the contractor.

Contractors found to have committed violations of CWHSSA's overtime requirements may have their

contracts terminated. Contractors found to have disregarded their obligations to workers or subcontractors

may be debarred from receiving future contracts for 3 years.

Contractors may challenge the Wage and Hour Division's determinations of violations before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Contractors may appeal ALJ decisions and orders to the Administrative Review Board

(ARB). ARB determinations on violations may be appealed to and are enforceable through the federal courts.
