While most models of cross-cultural education encom- pass learning about the ‘other’ to some degree, simply absorbing the health beliefs, idiosyncrasies and traditions of particular cultural groups is somewhat superficial and as such, unlikely to advance cross-cultural communication [9, 44]. Advocates of later cross-cultural models (cultural competence, cultural humility, cultural safety) would in- deed stress the need to augment the cultural awareness styled training undertaken and demanded by participants in the study. The compelled awareness of one’s own biases and their institutions’ potential to marginalize patients from non-mainstream cultural groups would be likely additions to teachings. In fact proponents of later models may argue that the over-confidence displayed by some participants in our study could be a reflection of their in- ability to recognize their own limitations and prejudices – and as such, underscoring the need for participants to undergo broader, holistic training. Intuitively, there is merit to multi-faceted models that incorporate socio-his- torical and political factors. At the same time, robust evi- dence for cross-cultural educational models, regardless of their content, is meagre [9, 44, 53–55]. Interpreter and bi-lingual health worker services possess some empirical support [56–58] though further research is warranted [17]. Thus, a conundrum unfolds whereby participants appear to be content with a limited model (in cultural awareness) yet the more expansive, recommended alterna- tives (cultural safety etc.) have yet to demonstrate rigorous utility beyond anecdotal evidence. The potential conse- quences of politically charged ‘blame and shame’ ap- proaches (which are more likely to occur within cultural safety-styled trainings) have also been documented [8, 19]. Further research is required to rigorously test the validity of the various models and their specific assumptions. It is also important to ensure that cross-cultural models are relevant to specific workplaces, flexible enough to address immediate challenges identified by frontline staff, and seek realistic, practical goals that are clear, quantifiable and have evidence for their utility.
