# thinking or acting.

If you see somebody doing something that really works, stop her and dissect it.

Next, go to the past. Ask him, “When you had a problem like this in

the past, what did you do that worked?” Much of our life happens

in patterns, so it’s highly likely that he has encountered this problem

at least a few times before. On one of those occasions he will almost

certainly have found some way forward, some action or insight or

connection that enabled him to move out of the mess. Get him thinking

about that and seeing it in his mind’s eye: what he actually felt and did,

and what happened next.

Finally, turn to the future. Ask your team member, “What do you

already know you need to do? What do you already know works in this

situation?” By all means oﬀer up one or two of your own experiences to

see if they might clarify his own. But operate under the assumption that

he already knows the solution—you’re just helping him recognize it.

The emphasis here should not be on whys—“Why didn’t that work?”

“Why do you think you should do that?”—because those lead both of

you into a fuzzy world of conjecture and concepts. Instead, focus on

the whats—“What do you actually want to have happen?” “What are a

couple of actions you could take right now?” These sorts of questions

yield concrete answers, in which your colleague can ﬁnd his actual self

doing actual things in the near-term future.
