That shift will encourage a far wider range of employees to generate

and test as many ideas as possible, increasing their chances of

discovering breakthroughs that enhance performance. But it will also

result in testing potentially higher-risk ideas with less oversight from

experienced data scientists—something that can make people hesitant

to run experiments. As we mentioned, one solution is to embed

guardrails (quantitative criteria that act as trip wires) in the platform.

Another is to roll out new features or changes in phases—a practice

common among the largest tech ﬁrms. For example, updates to mobile

apps from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store are released

that way to reduce risk.
