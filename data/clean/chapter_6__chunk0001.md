## Chapter 6 Cross-Cultural Competence and Cultural Intelligence in the Workplace

Cross-cultural competence (3C) and cultural intelligence (CQ) are two interrelated constructs that assess an individual’s ability to effectively perform in cross-cultural situations. This ability is becoming increasingly important due to globalization and the high costs associated with expatriate failures. Globalization, deﬁned as inter- dependence among countries, has increased the intercultural interactions many experience daily (Erez and Shokef 2008). These interactions often result in chal- lenges for people in both domestic and international organizations. Domestically, immigration has increased the cultural diversity in many organizations across the globe. Internationally, organizations are realizing that they must do business in all parts of the world to compete. Therefore, in order for companies to succeed, managers must be effective in other cultures (Morris et al. 2014). CQ and 3C are at the heart of what managers need to understand to participate in today’s global market. This becomes increasingly important when considering the statistics of how many expatriates leave their assignments early. It is estimated that expatriate failure costs the U.S. alone at least 2 billion dollars a year (Martinko and Douglas 1999). In order to avoid failures, expatriates need to develop 3C and CQ.

Competence, in the realm of work, refers to a level of proﬁciency or expertise that yields feelings and perceptions of having capabilities essential for successfully performing a job or fulﬁlling a duty. An individual can self-rate her or his level of competence or it can be rated by others. In contrast, a competency is “an underlying characteristic of an individual which is causally related to effective or superior performance in a job” (Briscoe and Hall 1999, p. 37).
