## Implementation of 360-degree Feedback System at Ridge Intellectual

When Ridge Intellectual, a graphics design firm, implemented 360-degree feedback in its organization two years ago, it was met with resistance and was eventually discontinued. Ron Bartlett, the president of Ridge Intellectual, had seen a demonstration by a 360-degree vendor at a trade conference and decided to use the system at Ridge. Subsequently, Bartlett worked with the consultant to implement the system. Specifically, he sent out a company-wide e-mail stating the reasons for changing to the new system, how the ratings collected using the new system would be linked to bonuses,

and the importance of completing the online training course on the system. The consultants provided online rater training for those who were interested as well as links to documents describing how to observe, assess, and record performance behaviors. After the surveys were made available, individuals were encouraged to contact HR if they had any problems.

Based on the information here what could Ridge have done to implement the 360-degree feedback system more successfully? Please refer to the characteristics of a good system listed in Table 8.5 in answering this question. (cid:2)
