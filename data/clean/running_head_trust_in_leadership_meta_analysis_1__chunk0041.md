# consistency (Avolio & Bass, 1991; Kirkpatrick & Locke, 1996). Also, individualised

consideration can signal to employees that leaders are benevolent (a defining feature of

affective trust) and will look out for their best interest, facilitating trust. All transformational

subdimensions predict trust (e.g., Kelloway et al., 2012).

The full range model also distinguishes laissez-faire, which represents an absence of

leadership, and transactional leadership styles (Bass, 1985). A transactional leadership style is

based on economic exchange (Pillai et al., 1999) and leader influence over follower

behaviour is achieved through contingent reward, where followers are rewarded for meeting

agreed-upon-objectives, or management-by-exception (MBE), where the leader only takes

corrective action, either active or passive, when things go wrong. Consistently engaging in

contingent reward is likely to signal competence, reliability and predictability all of which

denote aspects of ability or integrity (Mayer et al., 1995) or cognitive trust (McAllister,

1995). Thus, contingent reward helps followers trust that leaders will keep their word and

deliver on promises (Jung & Avolio, 2000). However, leaders who are disengaged (i.e.,

laissez-faire leadership) or engage in punitive behaviours (i.e., management-by-exception)

likely undermine the development of trust (e.g., Kelloway et al., 2012).
