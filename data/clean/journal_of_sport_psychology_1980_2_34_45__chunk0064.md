this test specifies that extraction of factors need not proceed beyond the point where the percentage of variance explained by successive factors levels off. This leveling off occurred after the sixth factor in each of the three solutions as illustrated in Figure 1. The five-factor solution was preferred since it was more meaningful than the six-factor solution. The eigen values of the factors in each solution exceeded the customary value of 1. It must be noted that factor analysis is a powerful though not the only method of establishing construct validity (Kerlinger, 1973, p. 468).
