# into it.

I think for me, I really taught myself. I would force myself to speak.

I would grade myself, I would count how long I’d speak, how much I

spoke. And eventually it got me to a level of comfort. I had multiple

speaking coaches, and it did take a lot of time to get here. But I think

that’s a reminder that almost anything is teachable.

The thing I hope, though, is that we don’t have to conform ourselves to

what leadership looks like today. I hope that there are more ways that

people think leaders could look like. That there can be quiet leaders,

extroverted leaders. There can be leaders who lead in diﬀerent ways,

and that we can honor all of those things. But in the meantime, we do

have a model of leadership that is strongly biased towards extroversion.

And that’s something which I felt like I needed to conform and learn.
