# Why Everyone Needs Flexible Scheduling

In many kinds of jobs—from hotel cleaning to equities trading—people have little control over their hours. A surge in guests or a dip in the stock market can disrupt well-laid plans in an instant. Among food service and retail workers, for example, unpredictable hours are standard. The sociol- ogists Daniel Schneider and Kristen Harknett found in 2017 that 80% of them have little say about their schedules, 70% face last-minute shifts, and 50% have back-to-back shifts. One cannot be a reliable parent under those conditions.

Professionals, too, often have to be available around the clock. The problem is so well-known in ﬁnance and consult- ing that many female MBA students, anticipating an impossi- ble work/life balance, don’t even apply for jobs in those ﬁelds. Professionals are frequently expected to be at work during regular business hours and to be available, as the sociologists Erin Kelly and Phyllis Moen found, for “early morning calls to oﬀshore colleagues, last-minute but all-too-common work requests at 10 pm, and ubiquitous emails, texts, and instant messaging.” Kelly and Moen describe a culture of inﬂated expectations: People work long days and weekends, some- times to no business end, just to look busy to their managers, who themselves need to look busy to their managers.

For low-wage workers in manufacturing and health care,

the problem is often inﬂexible schedules. One manager described the challenges of hiring for his production line. “It’s a 12-hour position,” he told us, “so ﬁnding female work- ers is really, really hard. We’re not family focused.” His ﬁrm’s competitors oﬀer ﬂexible schedules, he explained, but not his employer, which means it has to resort to other measures. “We try to ﬁnd women who are very independent,” he said— those who “don’t have kids, family, you know?”

A tech-industry HR manager told us that attendance policies are tough on parents on the production line, where workers get a point deducted each time they miss a shift— even if they call in sick. After a few points they get ﬁred. At a health care company we visited, a line manager spoke of similar hardships for staﬀers who are single parents. “I don’t know how they do it,” she said. “It is very much: Clock in at 7:00, clock out 3:30,” with no exceptions. Low-wage workers, it’s fair to say, are often just one case of strep throat away from being terminated.

Covid-19 intensiﬁed the need for less-rigid schedules, especially for people of color. Fifty-two percent of nonwhite adults who quit a job in 2021 cited a lack of ﬂexibility, com- pared with 38% of white adults.

Before the pandemic some eight in 10 companies oﬀered

ﬂextime, but employees rarely used it. One hurdle is that managers keep it under wraps. In 64% of companies that oﬀer ﬂextime the arrangements for it are informal. An HR manager at an advertising agency told us that he doesn’t publicize ﬂexibility options for fear that “within minutes the line would be out the door and down the hall.” Poor corpo- rate transparency about work/life options may be partly why before the pandemic, 63% of workers reported that they needed more ﬂexibility.

Even when ﬂexibility is oﬀered, employees frequently

don’t ask for it, fearing they’ll be penalized. They’re not wrong. The sociologist Lisa Dodson found that when low- wage mothers tried to negotiate for ﬂexibility, employers tagged them as unreliable and irresponsible. Across high- and low-skill jobs, employees who seek ﬂexibility are often seen as lacking commitment and are given poor perfor- mance ratings, meager raises, and less-frequent promotions. So employees simply don’t request it, opting to get by with patchwork solutions.
