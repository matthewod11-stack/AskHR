# LEARNING AND MEMORY

Karl Lashley is the most important ﬁgure in the development of physiological psychology and the biology of memory in America. He obtained his PhD at Johns Hopkins University wherehestudiedwithJohnWatsonandwasheavilyinﬂuenced by Watson’s developing notions of behaviorism. While there healsoworkedwithSheherdFranzatagovernmenthospitalin Washington;theypublishedapapertogetherin1917ontheef- fects of cortical lesions on learning and retention in the rat. Lashley then held teaching and research positions at the Uni- versity of Minnesota (1917–1926), the University of Chicago (1929–1935), and at Harvard from 1935 until his death in 1958. During the Harvard years, he spent much of his time at theYerkes Primate Laboratory in Orange Park, Florida.

Lashley devoted many years to an analysis of brain mech- anisms of learning, using the lesion-behavior method, which he developed and elaborated from his work with Franz. Dur- ing this period, Lashley’s theoretical view of learning was heavily inﬂuenced by two congruent ideas—localization of function in neurology and behaviorism in psychology.

Lashley describes the origins of his interest in brain sub- strates of memory and Watson’s developing views of behav- iorism in the following letter he wrote to Ernest Hilgard in 1935:

In the 1914, I think, Watson called attention of his seminar to the French edition of Bechterev, and that winter the seminar was de- voted to translation and discussion of the book. In the spring I served as a sort of unpaid assistant and we constructed apparatus and planned experiments together. We simply attempted to re- peat Bechterev’s experiments. We worked with withdrawal re- ﬂexes, knee jerk, pupil. Watson took the initiative in all this, but he was also trying to photograph the vocal cord, so I did much of the actual experimental work. I devised drainage tubes for the parotid and submaxiallary ducts and planned the salivary work which I published. As we worked with the method, I think our enthusiasm for it was somewhat dampened. Watson tried to es- tablish conditioned auditory reﬂexes in the rat and failed. Our whole program was then disrupted by the move to the lab in Meyer’s clinic. There were no adequate animal quarters there. Watson started work with the infants as the next best material available. I tagged along for awhile, but disliked the babies and found me a rat lab in another building. We accumulated a con- siderable amount of experimental material on the conditioned re- ﬂex which has never been published. Watson saw it as a basis for a systematic psychology and was not greatly concerned with the
