# and product decisions.

Covid-19’s complexity, with its attending uncertainty, had to be

embraced before top management could devise solutions to deal with

it. Thus, the three decision-making principles became a guiding light

as management took a series of iterative actions to adapt to Covid-19’s

evolving nature. For example, initially Best Buy had to close all 1,025

stores, but then it became one of the ﬁrst national retailers to reopen

its stores safely a few months later. When the stores closed, Best Buy

furloughed 51,300 employees, but many of them were brought back

when stores reopened. Throughout, Barry relied heavily on her ﬁeld

teams to make the best decisions they could, guided by the principles

they had agreed upon. Barry and her team knew that each decision was

provisional and could be revisited and changed as the crisis unfolded.
