## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 153

(2002) reports r = −.17 between the two domains; Miles, Borman, Spector, and Fox (2002) report r = −.11; and Kelloway, Loughlin, Barling, and Nault (2002) report r = −.20. Perhaps most telling in resolving the issue of viewing OCBs and CWBs as one or two di- mensions is emerging evidence of different correlates of the two domains. For example, Miles et al. report that a measure of nega- tive affectivity correlates .35 with CWB and .12 with OCB. Thus, al- though the OCB and CWB domains are not unrelated, we view them as two meaningfully distinct domains.
