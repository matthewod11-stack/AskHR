# INTRODUCTION

Workplace stress is a ubiquitous and increasingly recognized phenomenon that affects individuals across various industries and professions. It is a multifaceted issue that can have profound implications for both employees and organizations. While some level of stress can be motivating and even necessary for productivity, excessive and chronic workplace stress can lead to a range of negative consequences, including impaired physical and mental health, decreased job satisfaction, and reduced organizational performance. In contrast, fostering well-being in the workplace is essential for creating a thriving and resilient workforce. This article explores the complex relationship between workplace stress and well-being, highlighting the factors that contribute to stress and strategies that promote well-being. The sources of workplace stress are diverse and often interrelated. One significant source of stress is the demand for increased productivity and longer working hours. In today's competitive business environment, employees may find themselves under constant pressure to meet deadlines and achieve ever-higher performance targets. This pressure can lead to burnout, a state of chronic physical and emotional exhaustion, which can have serious consequences for individual well-being [1], [2].

Furthermore, interpersonal conflicts and strained relationships with colleagues or supervisors can also be sources of stress. Conflicts can arise from differences in communication styles, values, or expectations, and they often undermine a healthy work environment. The constant need to navigate these conflicts can take a toll on an employee's mental and emotional well-being.
