# Homogeneity in Upper Levels

A question of great interest to researchers as well as laypeople is why certain people win out in workplace contests. Clearly, ability and merit should be important factors; however, individual per- sonality has also been shown to shape the fates of organizational contestants. Research has demonstrated that high self-monitors have superior job performance to low self-monitors (Mehra et al., 2001), especially when performance is measured through super- visory ratings (Day et al., 2002), and receive more promotions early in their career (Kilduff & Day, 1994). Extending such ﬁndings across organizational hierarchies suggests that high self-monitors should be overrepresented in middle- and upper-management po- sitions. Because progression into middle management has been ar- gued to be mainly a function of likeability and perceived ability to work with senior management (Hogan, Curphy, & Hogan, 1994), high self-monitors may have a competitive advantage in promo- tional tournaments. As a result, they may be disproportionately rep- resented in the upper echelons of organizations.

This conclusion corresponds with ﬁndings from a large insur- ance company in which employees with higher-level jobs (manage- ment) were typically high self-monitors and those with lower-level
