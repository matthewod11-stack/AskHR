do. Text books that do not have a JDM chapter occasionally cover some JDM content in the chapter on teams (and, rarely, the chapter on personnel selection).

- JDMtopicsarenotwellrepresentedin the output of IOOB-oriented consult- ing ﬁrms. Only 1 of 45 white papers and technical reports displayed on the Websitesof three well-known consult- ing ﬁrms pertained directly to JDM.

In our view, the lack of cross-fertilization between JDM and IOOB is unfortunate. We believe that increased exposure to—and application of—theories, methods, and ﬁndings from the JDM ﬁeld will aid IOOB researchers and practitioners in studying workplace decisions as decisions. This is the major premise of our article.2

To be sure, there have been others before us who have attempted to encourage IOOB to embrace JDM methods and research (and vice versa). Consider, for example,

I have been of the philosophical position that [IOOB and JDM] (if I could get either to read the papers of the other) ... have much to say to each other. (Naylor, 1984, p. 2)

Decision theory offers a unique ana- lytical framework for studying person- nel/human resource management (HRM) decisions. (Boudreau, 1984, p. 198)

As the very nature of human resource management is a series of choices (including recruiting, hiring, evaluating, promoting, transferring, demoting, and terminating), the foibles and shortcom- ings of human decision makers are of

However, our target readership for this article is the IOOB community (though we hope that the JDM community also ﬁnds the article interesting and useful). With our target readership in mind, we have primarily focused on how IOOB can beneﬁt from more infusion of JDM approaches as well as why so little JDM-to-IOOB transfer has occurred so far.
