## Five competitive forces: The state of competition in an industry

depends on ﬁve basic forces. These forces govern the proﬁt structure

is apportioned. That value may be drained away through the rivalry

among existing competitors. It can also be bargained away through the

power of suppliers or the power of customers, or it can be constrained

by the threat of new entrants or the threat of substitutes. Strategy can

be viewed as building defenses against the competitive forces or as

ﬁnding a position in an industry where the forces are weaker. Changes
