# Transiting the Modern to Postmodern Era

tensions,” and have been as much transformed as transforma- tive in effect (p. 439). And just as there is no “going back” in our life histories (Walkerdine, 2000), so it goes for social psychology as it confronts a changing twenty-ﬁrst-century world in which notions of culture, the global, and of human life itself are everywhere being debated and transformed. Epistemological matters remain as central to these questions as they did long before the formal inception of the ﬁeld. Whereas much of social psychology has been wrought through industrial world terms, as have many of its critical histories, the challenge before us is about life in postindus- trial times, challenges of human-technology interfaces only imagined in the 1950s, and of life-generating and life- encoding technologies, such as cloning and the Human Genome Projects redrawing the bounds around personal, cul- tural, social, political, and economic life and what it means to be human (Haraway, 1997). Not unlike how social-political reorderings called social psychology into being (Apfelbaum, 1986), so we must consider how globalization, the Internet, and other technologies fundamentally change the nature of social psychology today. Protests against agencies such as the IMF and the World Bank are inviting reexamination of what is taking place in human and environmental rights as the eco- nomics and location of the workplace, not to mention judicial life, become less clearly demarcated by national boundaries. The economy of production has been morphing into one of marketing, to a “brand name” economy of obsessional corpo- rate proportions (Klein, 2000). Time and space alterations, like those of human–technology boundaries, confront social psychology anew with matters of the body and embodiment and with changes in human-technology connections (Bayer, 1998b). Social psychology, like other human sciences, will most likely “go on being remade as long as ways of life go on being remade,” and, perhaps best regarded—and embraced— as Smith characterizes the human sciences (p. 861): “The human sciences have had a dramatic life, a life lived as an attempt at reﬂective self-understanding and self-recreation” (p. 870). Who knows, should social psychology take its lived historical subjects and subjectivities seriously, and should this be accompanied by recognition of the social, political, moral, and technocultural warp and woof of life lived here in what William James called the “blooming, buzzing confu- sion,” we may exercise the courage, as Morawski (2002) says of earlier theorists’ efforts, to not only meet the world halfway but to engage it in creatively meaningful ways. An imaginable course is suggested by Smith’s claim that the “history of human sciences is itself a human science” (p. 870). That would indeed be to make social psychology history.
