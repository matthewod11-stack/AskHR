# Figure 3.7. Forced Choice Appraisal

The rater is required to pick one statement that is most descriptive and one that is least descriptive of the individual. The statements are deigned so that only one of the favorable and one of the unfavorable statement~ is associated with job performance. This information is not provided to the rater, thus, the results of the rating are known only to the personnel department, which has the key. This kind of rating tends to be resented by both managers and 'ndividuals, and feedback is obviously impossible. There are also serious questions as to whether it is possible to develop a set of state- ments that distinguish between good and poor performers.
