What ﬁndings such as these show us is, ﬁrst, that learning happens

when we see how we might do something better by adding some new

nuance or expansion to our own understanding. Learning rests on our

grasp of what we’re doing well, not on what we’re doing poorly, and

certainly not on someone else’s sense of what we’re doing poorly. And

second, that we learn most when someone else pays attention to what’s

working within us and asks us to cultivate it intelligently. We’re often

told that the key to learning is to get out of our comfort zones, but

these ﬁndings contradict that particular chestnut: Take us very far out

of our comfort zones, and our brains stop paying attention to anything

other than surviving the experience. It’s clear that we learn most in

our comfort zones, because that’s where our neural pathways are most

concentrated. It’s where we’re most open to possibility, most creative,

insightful, and productive. That’s where feedback must meet us—in our
