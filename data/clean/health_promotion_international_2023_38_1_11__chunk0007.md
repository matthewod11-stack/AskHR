# L. Thissen et al.

Both psychological and physical health problems are more common among people who lack social attachments. (…) belongingness is not only pleasant but also apparently very beneficial to the individual in multiple ways.

Neuro-imaging research has demonstrated that social exclusion, or unbelonging, is registered by the brain as a physical injury (Eisenberger et al., 2003), while Mattes and Lang (Mattes and Lang, 2021, p. 9) acknowledge belonging as an important source of psy- chological and social resilience. Beyond this physical/ psychological dimension of belonging, scholars have pointed to its political and spatio-material dimensions. Yuval-Davis (Yuval-Davis, 2006, p. 204) for instance recognizes the political dimensions of belonging that construct, claim, justify or resist forms of socio-spa- tial inclusion and exclusion. People often express feel- ings of belonging in relation to communities that are imagined to be rooted in a particular place (a nation, a region, a neighbourhood) or by making use of material symbols (flags, clothing, make-up). This paper follows Mattes and Lang (Mattes and Lang, 2021) by appre- ciating the mutual implications and connectedness of the different dimensions of belonging and its impor- tance to health. In order to understand how belonging impacts the realm of work, we need to turn to other scholars.

Belonging at work Organizational studies have looked at belonging at work from different perspectives, yet the impact on health remains untouched. The political dimension aligns with Hagerty et al.’s (Hagerty et al., 1992) fundamental characteristics of belonging: being val- ued, needed or important to others and the feeling to fit in. McClure and Brown (McClure and Brown, 2008, p. 10) found six constituents of workplace (un)belonging that could fall in these characteris- tics: being invited and learning to be part of a work- place; connecting with colleagues and wanting to be included; doing work and being recognized; natural selection, competing, being excluded and not belong- ing; being needed and feeling deeply involved in the work; and reflecting on the passing of time, work and people. In their study involving teleworkers, Belle et al. (Belle et al., 2015) show that stimulating organizational dynamics are important even when employees work from home. Their participants stress the importance of organizational identification, the desire to be included and demonstrations of commu- nal qualities, such as empathy, care for one another and self-sacrifice (p. 88). Such organizational dynam- ics augment recognizing people’s talents, interests and experiences, as well as finding acceptance of their
