## Analyzing Best Practices in Employee Health Management

women’s, offering a cash incentive for completing the HA was asso- ciated with increasing the male-female differential.

In short, a cash incentive for completion of the HA tended to be more effective in promoting behavior change among men. In contrast, both a beneﬁts-integrated incentive for completing the HA and a noncash incentive for participating in a health coaching program were positively associated with the sex coefﬁcient. This suggests that these incentive models were differentially effective in promoting behavior change among women. An examination of the scatter plots relating the effect coefﬁcients for sex to the sex distributions of the companies provided suggestive evidence that this statisticalinteractioneffectwastiedtothedemographicenvironment of the company.

Five HERO Scorecard measures were associated with the age coefﬁcient in the participant behavior change model. Typically, older employees achieved greater behavior change subsequent to complet- ing the HA. Three types of incentives strengthened that relationship.

A different incentive—a cash incentive for completion of the HA—was positively related to the age coefﬁcient. In an environ- ment where increasing age was associated with lower T2 risks—the dominant case—providing a cash incentive may have served to im- prove behavior change among younger employees or it may have diminished behavior change among older employees.

The presence and strength of a champion network also inﬂu- enced the relationship of age to behavior change. A stronger cham- pion network tended to strengthen the relationship between age and behaviorchangeandtendedtoreduceriskstoanevengreaterdegree.
