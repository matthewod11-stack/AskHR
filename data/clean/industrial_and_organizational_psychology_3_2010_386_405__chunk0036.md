# PhilosophicalApproaches

Research on decision making has primar- ily used three approaches (Brown, 1989; Maule & Svenson, 1993; von Winterfeldt, 1989):

- 1. the normative approach, which de- ﬁnes ‘‘ideal’’ or ‘‘rational’’ judgments or choices as those that adhere to formal models (such as the expected utility model or even its subjec- tive variant) and axioms (such as transitivity),

- 2. the descriptive approach (such as Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory and catalog of heuristics and biases), which outlines the systematic departures of real-world from normative decision makers standards—demonstrating, in other words, that decision makers are ‘‘not only irrational but predictably irra- tional’’ (Ariely, 2008, p. 6, emphasis added), and

- 3. the prescriptive approach (‘‘the nor- mative tempered by the descriptive’’; von Winterfeldt, 1989, p. 499), which attempts to improve decision making via, technology-based decision support systems that reduce the representational and computa- tional complexities inherent in nor- mative models. for example,

In other words, the normative approach has served as the foundation for both the descriptive and the prescriptive approaches in decision-making research. In the next the normative section, we maintain that approach has, for the most part, served the ﬁeld of JDM well—and we urge the ﬁeld of IOOB to develop more normative theories.
