## work: 45% of white-collar employees and 62% of blue-collar employees

want to be splitters, whereas 55% of white-collar employees and 28% of

blue-collar employees want to be blenders. Our survey of large-company

CHROs found that HR leaders consistently underestimated the percent

of workers who want to be splitters.

This matters quite a bit because when employees are not working in

their preferred ways — meaning if they prefer to be a splitter, but their

work requires them to be a blender (or the other way around) — they are

less engaged, more likely to report burning out at work, and more likely

to be watching for or actively seeking a new job.
