# Possible Limitations

While our research provides evidence that local large ﬁrms can have a

stiﬂing impact on startups’ ability to grow, a limitation of this study

is that it is generally hard to study or pinpoint spillover impacts.

For example, we found that when ﬁrms and startups are similar, the

crowding out impact is smaller than when ﬁrms and startups are

dissimilar. We hypothesize that this is because these ﬁrms provide
