# less energy.

You can also explore novel approaches to hardware design, such

as locating memory inside computing cores, which can cut energy

dissipation by shortening data travel distances. Or, deploying devices

mimicking brain functions, which have been show to use 1,000 times

less energy than current standards. Other models have experimented

with running on low-powered microcontrollers. New components, such

as photonic accelerators, 3D chips, and new chip cooling techniques can

deliver computing power with less energy usage.

There are also eﬃciencies to be found in model design. DeepSeek,

for instance, demonstrated how it could save on compute and energy

resources by deploying a “mixture of experts” technique that splits

the AI’s neural networks into diﬀerent categories. The company also

used other creative approaches, such as lopping oﬀ decimal places on

numbers used in calculations without noticeable losses in performance.
