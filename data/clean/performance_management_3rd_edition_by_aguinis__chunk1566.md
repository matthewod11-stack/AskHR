## Chapter 9 • Performance Management Skills

- Pattern identification. Feedback is most useful if it is about a pattern of poor per- formance rather than isolated events or mistakes. Identifying a pattern of poor performance also allows for a better understanding of the causes leading to poor performance.

- Confidence in the employee. Good feedback includes a statement that the manager has confidence that the employee will be able to improve her performance. It is important for the employee to hear this from the manager. This reinforces the idea that feedback is about performance and not the performer. Note, however, that this should be done only if the manager indeed believes the employee can improve her performance. In the case of a chronic poor performance, this type of information could be used out of context later if the employee is fired.

- Advice and idea generation. Feedback can include advice given by the supervisor about how to improve performance. In addition, however, the employee should play an active role in generating ideas about how to improve performance in the future.

Many of the above-mentioned recommendations are particularly useful when feed- back is given to employees who score low on a personality trait labeled core self-evaluation, which is a combination of four traits: self-esteem (i.e., the degree to which an individual holds a favorable attitude toward himself), self-efficacy (i.e., the degree to which an indi- vidual believes he is capable of taking action and taking control over events), emotional sta- bility (i.e., the degree to which an individual is not insecure, guilty, or timid), and locus of control (i.e., the degree to which an individual believes he can control events and outcomes in his live). Individuals with low core self-evaluations feel they are less able to deal with the world and, consequently, are overall less satisfied with their jobs and lives. Thus, supervi- sors need to be aware that feedback is likely to be received by individuals with low versus high core self-evaluations.30 For example, low core self-evaluation employees may feel hurt and helpless after receiving negative feedback. Thus, the recommendations about “confi- dence in the employee” are particularly relevant. Similarly, the recommendations about “advice and idea generation” are also particularly helpful so that there is a clear course of action—rather than feelings of helplessness and lack of direction.

Consider the following vignette in which Andrea, a supervisor, has observed a specific performance event and provides feedback to her subordinate. Andrea is the manager of a small retail store with approximately five employees. With a small staff, Andrea looks for coaching opportunities on a weekly basis. Andrea is working with Matt today, and she has just witnessed him complete a customer sale. Matt did not follow several steps, however, that should be included at each sale and, because the store is now empty, Andrea decides it is a perfect opportunity for a coaching session.

ANDREA: Hey, Matt, that was great the way that you just assisted that customer in

finding her correct size in the jeans. Thanks for taking the extra time to help her.

MATT:
