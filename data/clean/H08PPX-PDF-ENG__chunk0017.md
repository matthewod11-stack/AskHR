## “social & economic justice” as fundamental organizational values. Their

leadership has prioritized DEI within the company, using metrics that

reﬂect these values, such as engagement with diverse suppliers, their

impact on the communities they serve, and their eﬀorts to reduce harm

in the regions where they operate.

Organizations should also consider how they deﬁne and value

meritocracy—speciﬁcally, how they recruit, hire, and reward the

most qualiﬁed employees. A balanced scorecard approach to human

resources, integrating both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial metrics like

DEI, enables leaders to identify advancement opportunities and talent

pipeline bottlenecks. TD Bank, which has been recognized as a

leader in corporate equality and a top workplace for diverse talent,

exempliﬁes this approach through its strategic emphasis on customer,

colleague, and community experience, which is underpinned by their

commitment to creating spaces where employees and community

members feel respected and empowered.

A comprehensive DEI strategy that aligns metrics with company values

helps leaders uncover blind spots in policies, practices, and procedures

that may inadvertently undermine merit-based decision-making. This

alignment ensures that DEI eﬀorts support, rather than conﬂict with,

the organization’s commitment to meritocracy.
