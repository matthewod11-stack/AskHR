# Metaphysical Behaviorism

Metaphysical behaviorists took a more aggressive stance to- ward consciousness than methodological behaviorists. They believed that scientiﬁc psychology should explain, not shun, consciousness. Two reasons guided them. First, they wanted to achieve a comprehensive scientiﬁc account of every- thing human, and since consciousness is undoubtedly some- thing humans have, it should not be ceded to the humanities (Lashley, 1923). Second, stimuli registered only privately in a person’s experience sometimes affects behavior (Skinner, 1957). If I have a headache, it exists only in my private con- sciousness, butitaltersmybehavior:Itakeaspirin,becomeir- ritable, and tell people I have a headache. Excluding private stimuli from psychology by methodological ﬁat would pro- duce incomplete theories of behavior. (This is not the place to discussthevariousandsubtlewaysmetaphysicalbehavior- ists had of explaining or dissolving consciousness. I will focus only on how such behaviorists approached learning and

cognition.) Metaphysical behaviorism came in two forms, physiological behaviorism and radical behaviorism.

Physiological Behaviorism. The source of physiologi- cal behaviorism was Russian objective psychology, and its greatest American exponent was Karl Lashley, who coined the term “methodological behaviorism,” only to reject it (Lashley, 1923, pp. 243–244):

Let me cast off the lion’s skin. My quarrel with [methodological] behaviorism is not that it has gone too far, but that it has hesi- tated . . . that it has failed to develop its premises to their logical conclusion. To me the essence of behaviorism is the belief that the study of man will reveal nothing except what is adequately describable in the concepts of mechanics and chemistry. . . . I believe that it is possible to construct a physiological psychology which will meet the dualist on his own ground . . . and show that [his] data can be embodied in a mechanistic system. . . . Its phys- iological account of behavior will also be a complete and ade- quate account of all the phenomena of consciousness . . . demanding that all psychological data, however obtained, shall be subjected to physical or physiological interpretation.

Ultimately, Lashley said, the choice between behaviorism and traditional psychology came down to a choice between two “incompatible” worldviews, “scientiﬁc versus humanis- tic.” It had been demanded of psychology heretofore that “it mustleaveroomforhumanidealsandaspirations.”But“other sciences have escaped this thralldom,” and so must psychol- ogy escape from “metaphysics and values” and “mystical obscurantism” by turning to physiology.

For the study of learning, the most important physiologi- cal behaviorist was Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849–1936). Although Pavlov is mostly thought of as the discoverer of classical or Pavlovian conditioning, he was ﬁrst and foremost a physiologist in the tradition of Sechenov. For him, the phenomena of Pavlovian conditioning were of interest be- cause they might reveal the neural processes underlying associative learning—he viewed all behavior as explicable via association—and his own theories about conditioning were couched in neurophysiological terms.

The differences between Pavlov’s and Thorndike’s proce- dures for studying learning posed two questions for the asso- ciative tradition they both represented. Pavlov delivered an unconditional stimulus (food) that elicited the behavior, or unconditional response (salivation), that he wished to study. He paired presentation of the US with an unrelated condi- tional stimulus (only in one obscure study did he use a bell); ﬁnding that gradually the CS came to elicit salivation (now called the conditional response), too. Thorndike had to await the cat’s ﬁrst working of the manipulandum before rewarding
