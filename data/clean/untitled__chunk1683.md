# Behavioral Methods

The prescientiﬁc history of psychology aside, the formal im- plementation of behavioral methods for assessing personality is usually traced to the World War II activities of the United States Ofﬁce of Strategic Services (OSS), the predecessor or- ganization to the Central Intelligence Agency. Once again the winds of war instigated advances in the methods of behav- ioral science, just as they have in the biological and physical sciences. To aid in selecting operatives for covert intelligence missions, the OSS observed how recruits behaved in a variety of contrived problem-solving and stress-inducing situations and on this basis predicted the likely quality of their perfor- mance in the ﬁeld (Ofﬁce of Strategic Services Assessment Staff, 1948; see also Handler, 2001). A gap of more than 20 years followed before the OSS methods led to a clearly deﬁned approach to assessment, mainly because the emer- gence of systematic behavioral assessment techniques had to await new ways of conceptualizing personality for assess- ment purposes.

Of many contributions to the literature that reconceptual- ized personality in ways that fostered the development of be- havioral assessment, two can be singled out for their clarity and inﬂuence. In 1968, Walter Mischel published Personality and Assessment (Mischel, 1968), a book in which he argued that personality traits are semantic ﬁctions, that continuity in behavioracrosstimeandplaceexistsonlyasafunctionofsim- ilarity across situations, and that assessment of behavior should accordingly focus on its situational determinants. A few years later, Goldfried and Kent (1972) drew a sharp dis- tinction between “traditional” and “behavioral” assessment
