# such establishment to the workers

Note: If workers' compensation is provided, this information must include the name of the workers' compensation insurance carrier, the name

of the policyholder, the name and telephone number of each person who must be notiﬁed of an injury or death, and the time period within which such notice must be given. This requirement in the section above may be satisﬁed by giving the worker a photocopy of any workers'

compensation notice required by state law.

Payroll statements for workers. In addition to making records of payroll information (see Recordkeeping section below), the farm labor

contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association must provide each migrant or seasonal agricultural worker a written statement of this information. This information must be provided at the time of payment for each pay period which must be no less often than every two

weeks (or semi-monthly). In addition to the payroll information speciﬁed below, such statement shall also include the employer's name,

address, and employer identiﬁcation number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service. In the case of a worker who is jointly employed, only

one of the two joint employers needs to provide a written statement to the workers.

Responsibilities of Joint Employers. Agricultural employers who use the services of a farm labor contractor may be in a situation of joint employment with the contractor in regard to the employees. Joint employment means that an individual is employed by two or more persons

at the same time. Where a joint employment relationship exists, each of the employers must ensure that the employee receives all

employment-related rights granted by the MSPA, such as accurate and timely disclosure of the terms and conditions of employment, written

payroll records, and payment of wages when due. If either party fails to comply with the law, both parties may be held liable. For more detail

on joint employment see the Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #12: Agricultural Employers Under the Fair Labor Standards Act(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs12.pdf) and Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #35: Joint Employment and Independent

Contractors Under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs35.pdf).
