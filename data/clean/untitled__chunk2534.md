# ROOTS OF THE FIELD

Health psychology is distinguished from behavioral medicine in that the latter is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld examining rela- tionships between behavior and health and is not limited to psychology. Yet health psychology does have foundations in other health and social sciences. Its core knowledge base involves the integration of biological, cognitive, affective, social and psychological bases of behavior with biological, cognitive, affective, social, and psychological bases of health and disease. Health psychology also includes knowledge of health policy and the organization of health care delivery systems. It is a very broad ﬁeld, characterized by studies in health behavior, behavioral risk factors for illness, response to illness, the impact of social support on health, culture and health, physician-patient relationships, psychoneuroim- munology, and psychophysiology among others.

Clinical health psychology is the term used for application of health psychology in professional practice. This specialty

Mind–body relationships were very much the concern of priests, alchemists, shamans, or healers, and throughout his- tory a multiplicity of views converged in two alternating ap- proaches:aunitaryviewthatpostulatesthatmindandbodyare indivisibleandadualisticviewthatseesthemasseparateenti- ties. The roots of health psychology can be traced back to the unitary view of mind–body relationships (Taylor, 1999).

Our knowledge of prehistoric societies indicates that hu- mans considered mind and body as a unit, attributing physi- cal and mental illnesses to demonic possession or evil spirits. The early writings of Hebrews, Egyptians, and Chinese conﬁrmed this supernatural view of causality. Stone Age ar- chaeological ﬁndings in Europe and South America show ev- idence of a surgical procedure called trephination that some claim shamans used to allow evil forces to leave the body (Selling, 1940).

We are thankful to John Weinman, Ad Kaptein, Ralf Schwarzer, Hannah McGee, and Marie Johnston for their helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript and providing historical infor- mation regarding the development of Health Psychology in Europe.

In ancient Greece, the unitary view evolved to include nat- uralistic causes of disease, opening the way to modern medi- cine. Plato (427–347 B.C.) wrote that “it is not proper to cure
