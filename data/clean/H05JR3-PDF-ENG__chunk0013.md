## HBR / Digital Article / Ramp Up Your Career After Parental Leave

Concentrate on what you can do within the time you have, and excel at

that. When I returned to work following my second maternity leave, I gave

up supporting a major part of our business in order to focus purely on

building out our economic crime advisory work with the public sector.

Narrowing my focus in this way allowed me to devote the time necessary

to develop much more insightful content in my speciﬁc area. As a result,

we’ve been able to support the most sophisticated ﬁnancial centers in

improving their ﬁnancial crime defenses. I miss supporting the other part

of our business. But I would make the same decision again.
