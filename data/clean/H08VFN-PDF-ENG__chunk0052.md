## Solution 2: Distinguish familiar stress from new stress. When

projects hitch or fall behind schedule, stress increases, prompting

leaders to leap into action. But this leap can be an overreaction that

introduces confusion into operations, adding to the problem instead of

alleviating it.

To avoid overreaction, analyze your stress, determining whether it’s

familiar or new. Familiar stress is caused by problems that have

occurred before; new stress by problems that haven’t. New stress can

only be resolved by new plans, which are your responsibility as a leader;

familiar stress can be resolved by employing the solution that worked

last time, which is what managers are there for. So only get involved
