# THE HAPPY WORKER 31

Patton (2001) suggested that the meta-analysis of Iaffaldano and Muchinsky (1985), which found an average correlation of .17 be- tween satisfaction and performance, underestimated the true cor- relation. In their updated meta-analysis, Judge et al. found a higher correlation of .30. Other researchers have suggested that positive affect and positive emotions (Baron, 1990; Cote, 1999; George & Brief, 1992; Staw & Barsade, 1993; Wright & Staw, 1999) are more likely than job satisfaction to make workers more productive. In this chapter, we examine the assumptions underlying the happiness-productivity relation and propose hypotheses about the ways in which affect can lead to more or less productive workers depending on the tasks.
