differences in information processing goals. As an example, the ﬁrst author is American, and has a good friend from Singapore. One day on the golf course, the author tried to tell his Singaporean friend a joke that started ‘‘A duck walks into a bary.’’. The content of the joke is immaterial, because when the joke was ﬁnished, the friend asked ‘‘why would a duck walk into a bar?’’ This common joke introduction, which typically puts listeners in a play frame with a goal of processing information for its humor, was unfamiliar to the friend. Thus, the friend was never actually able to devote his attention to the content of the joke (which, incidentally, is very funny). The same friend also asked the ﬁrst author why late night comedians like Jay Leno were ‘‘allowed’’ to make biting and sarcastic jokes about political leaders. He seemed deeply offended by the notion that people were allowed to make nasty or caustic remarks about leaders, and noted that leaders never receive the same public mistreatment in Singapore. Clearly, in listening to the personal political jokes of late-night comedians, the friend’s ability to process the jokes using a play frame was substantially limited by his culturally determined experiences.

However, incongruity theory and its advancements (e.g., Wyer & Collins, 1992) provide valuable insights that make blanket recommendation against using humor in cross-cultural interactions somewhat premature, particularly given the potential beneﬁts of using humor. First, the types of humor that are likely to ‘‘work’’ with diverse audiences are those that employ expectation systems that are relatively universal. Davis (1993) notes that humor might be appreciated by broad audiences if ‘‘at least some aspects of the expectation systems violated by incongruities and ambiguities are enduring and universal’’ (p. 27). Brown (1991) devotes an entire book to understanding universals, and notes that while much of an individual’s knowledge is culture-bound, schemas surrounding many phenomena such as language, religious practices, family structures, war, government, and shelter are universal. Haig (1988) makes the observation that ‘mother-in-law’ jokes are likely to go over well in many societies. In the same vein, Hertzler (1970) notes that mass art, mass communication, and mass government (e.g., the European Union) might be associated with shared expectation systems, as might urban congestion, trafﬁc, technological phenomena (e.g., the internet), and sports. Although this explanation for why humor often might not ‘‘go over well’’ in cross-cultural contexts might appear obvious, we believe that it might provide a core assumption for the study of humor and culture. Indeed, this implication of incongruity theory might be particularly useful for helping researchers deﬁne humor in ﬁeld or laboratory studies, where systematic attempts to vary humor quality might be attempted.
