larly of brightness contrast. At the time, brightness contrast was just another illusion or instance of noncorrespondence. It was demonstrated by noting that a patch of gray paper placed on a white background appears to be darker than an identical patch of gray paper placed on a dark background. This sug- gested to Mach that there was some form of inhibition occur- ring and that this inhibition could be between adjacent neural units. He suggested that the receptors responding to the bright surrounds inhibited the receptors responding to the gray paper in proportion to their activity, and this was more than the inhibition from the cells responding to the dimmer dark region surrounding the other patch, thus making the gray on white appear darker. This led to the prediction of the brightness phenomenon that now bears his name, Mach bands. This effect is seen in a light distribution that has a uni- form bright region and a uniform dark region with a linear ramplike transition in light intensity between the two. At the top of the ramp a bright stripe is perceived, while at the bot- tom a dark stripe is seen. These stripes are not in the light dis- tribution but can be predicted by an algebraic model in which neural intensities add to and subtract from those of adjacent neural units. This obviously suggests that some form of inhi- bition, such as that required by Hering’s model of color vi- sion, can occur in sensory channels.

Unfortunately, psychologists sometimes look at phenome- nological data with the same suspicion that they might look at reports of extrasensory phenomena such as the perception of ghosts. Truth seems to depend on identiﬁable physiology rather than phenomenology; hence, neural inhibition re- mained unaccepted. The breakthrough would come with Ragnar A. Granit (1900–1991), who would usher in the era of microelectrode recording of sensory responses. Granit was inspired by the work of British physiologist Lord Edgar Douglas Adrian (1889–1977), who was the ﬁrst to record electrical impulses in nerve ﬁbers, including optic nerves, and eventually developed a method to use microscopic elec- trodes to measure the response to stimulation by the optic nerve. Granit’s data began to show that when light is received by the eye, under some circumstances it could actually inhibit rather than excite neural activity. To conﬁrm this in humans he helped to develop the electroretinogram (ERG) technique to measure mass activity in the retina.

Haldan Keffer Hartline (1903–1983), who would go on to share the 1967 Nobel Prize with Granit, was also fascinated by Lord Adrian’s work. Hartline set about to use the micro- electrode measures Granit developed to record electrical im- pulses in individual nerve cells. His goal was to extend that research into analysis of how the visual nerve system worked. He did much of his work with the horseshoe crab, which has a compound eye (like that of a ﬂy) and has the
