## HBR / The Big Idea / Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want

your purpose; in step 3 your life vision. Step 4 is a portfolio analysis of

how you spend your 168-hour week, while step 5 involves setting life

satisfaction benchmarks. In step 6 you incorporate the results of the

ﬁrst ﬁve steps and determine your choices and potential changes in

your life, and in step 7 you map out a plan for putting your choices into

action. We recommend that you take notes throughout so that, by the

end, you can put an initial version of your life strategy on a single page.

(To help, we created a life strategy worksheet, which should be ﬁlled out

after you’ve gone through all the steps.)

This work may seem daunting, but in practice it should take you only

a few hours. That said, it might not be easy. You will have to challenge

yourself and go beyond the obvious. But you shouldn’t give up, because

the answers you’ll discover are so worthwhile. After all, what’s more

important than your life? Commit to thinking strategically about it, look

forward to the insights you will gain, and enjoy the journey.

Watch Rainer Strack explain how to build a successful life portfolio.
