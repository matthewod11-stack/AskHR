Assigning the job

- 1. A job offer may be made over the phone, in writing, or in person, depending on your organization's custom. The HR department typically handles the employment offer.

- 2. Salary and benefits are addressed at this point, and the potential employee is informed of any additional requirements. Make plans to complete the process if your company mandates a physical examination or a drug test. A time should be set for notice if the candidate requires extra time to consider the job offer.

You now need to make sure that any possible new hires are given a truthful job preview. Give them all the information they require about the position, including both the good and the negative. Tell them if travel is necessary for the work. Inform them if there are few chances for promotion and a high level of stress at work. Employers who take the 2008 Society for Human Resource Management recruiting and seriously. MBA and SPHR Myrna Gusdorf They set themselves up to have a staff that is unsatisfied and prone to high turnover by employing personnel as if the applicants must be persuaded to take the job and exposed only to the organization's favourable traits. Keep in mind that you are hiring for the long term; the position needs to be a suitable fit for both the organisation and the new employee. People are most likely to leave their jobs within the first few months of employment, frequently because the position ended up being different than they had anticipated. Repeating the hiring process for the same positions over and over again is costly for your company, stressful for HR, and, of course, stressful for the new hire.

- 1. When making the employment offer, stay away from mentioning an annual wage. Specify the amount of remuneration in terms of hours worked or months, as applicable. The courts have occasionally construed annual pay quotes as a minimum one-year employment contract.

- 2. If the employee is fired before that first year is over, you can be facing a lawsuit for breach of employment contract. Avoiding this is simple enough: don't mention an annual salary! For information on the enforceability of oral promises made during the employment process, see Eales

- 3. After making your choice, you must confirm your new hire's eligibility for employment. Employers are required to use only American residents and foreigners with valid work visas in accordance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act.

All new hires' employment eligibility must be confirmed within three days of their start date. The form must be completed and signed by both the employee and the employer, with the employee providing the required documentation to prove identification and authorization to work in the United States. The form lists the submitted documents, and the employer's signature attests to their appearance as authentic.
