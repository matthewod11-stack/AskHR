# The Kaufman Scales

Although numerous other intelligence tests employing Binet’s mental age concept or Wechsler’s statistical approach have appeared, none has approached the visibility or popular- ity of these two measures. Perhaps most notable after Binet and Wechsler among intelligence test developers is Alan Kaufman, who in addition to writing extensively about the assessment of intelligence (Kaufman, 1990, 1994) devel- oped his own general intelligence measures for children— the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1983)—and for adolescents and adults—the Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test (KAIT; Kaufman & Kaufman, 1993). Kaufman’s measures differed in two important respects from their predecessors. First, reﬂecting a theoretical rather than an empirical ap- proach, tasks were chosen not by testing how trial par- ticipants would respond to them, but by formulating certain constructs concerning the nature of intellectual functioning and using tasks that were considered likely to assess these constructs. Second, Kaufman included subtests designed to provide achievement as well as IQ scores, including assess- ment of abilities in reading and arithmetic.
