## Part I â€¢ Strategic and General Considerations

- Openness. Good systems have no secrets. First, performance is evaluated frequently and performance feedback is provided on an ongoing basis. Therefore, employees are continually informed of the quality of their performance. Second, the appraisal meeting consists of a two-way communication process during which information is exchanged, not delivered from the supervisor to the employee without his or her input. Third, standards should be clear and communicated on an ongoing basis. Finally, communications are factual, open, and honest.

- Correctability. The process of assigning ratings should minimize subjective aspects; however, it is virtually impossible to create a system that is completely objective because human judgment is an important component of the evalua- tion process. When employees perceive an error has been made, there should be a mechanism through which this error can be corrected. Establishing an appeals process, through which employees can challenge what may be unjust decisions, is an important aspect of a good performance management system.

- Standardization. As noted earlier, good systems are standardized. This means that performance is evaluated consistently across people and time. To achieve this goal, the ongoing training of the individuals in charge of appraisals, usually man- agers, is a must.

- Ethicality. Good systems comply with ethical standards. This means that the su- pervisor suppresses her personal self-interest in providing evaluations. In addi- tion, the supervisor evaluates only performance dimensions for which she has sufficient information, and the privacy of the employee is respected.56

Table 1.5 lists the characteristics of an ideal performance management system. Think about the performance management system implemented in your organization or the last organization for which you worked. Which of the features listed in Table 1.5 included in the system you are considering? How far is your system from the ideal?
