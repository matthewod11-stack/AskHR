Don’t wait for the whistle to blow.

In too many companies, lower-level employees fear speaking truth to

power about misalignments with purpose and values. To help combat this,

my colleagues and I developed the strategic ﬁtness process — a structured

process that allows senior managers to lead conversations that uncover the

whole truth about how their organization really works. It also helps senior

management rest easier, knowing that they are not just waiting around,

hoping the whistle doesn’t blow.
