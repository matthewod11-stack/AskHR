# Learning and Memory

cerebellum, mossy-parallel ﬁbers and climbing ﬁbers, yields a long-lasting decrease in the excitability of parallel ﬁbers— Purkinje neuron synapses. Ito developed considerable evi- dence that this cerebellar process underlies plasticity of the vestibular-ocular reﬂex. Thompson and associates developed evidence, particularly using genetically altered mice, that cerebellar cortical LTD is one of the mechanisms underly- ing classical conditioning of eyeblink and other discrete responses.

Fear conditioning was characterized behaviorally by Neal Miller and analyzed neuronally by several groups, particu- larly Michael Davis (1992), Joseph LeDoux (2000), and Michael Fanselow (1994), and their many students. They showed that at least for classical conditioning of fear, the es- sential structure is the amygdala, which may contain the basic memory trace for this form of learning (but see just below). The process of LTP may serve to code the amygdalar fear memory.

Duncan’s discovery in 1949 of the effects of electrocon- vulsive shock on retention of simple habits in the rat began the modern ﬁeld of memory consolidation. Hebb and Gerard were quick to point out the implication of two memory processes, one transient and fragile and the other more per- manent and impervious. James McGaugh and his associates (1989) have done the classic work on the psychobiology of memory consolidation. He and his colleagues demonstrated memory facilitation with drugs and showed that these effects were direct and not due to possible reinforcement effects of the drugs (and similarly for ECS impairment).

The amygdala is critical for instrumental learning of fear. McGaugh and his associates demonstrated that for both pas- sive and active avoidance learning (animals must either not respond, or respond quickly, to avoid shock) amygdala le- sions made immediately after training abolished the learned fear. Surprisingly, if these same lesions were made a week after training, learned fear was not abolished, consistent with a process of consolidation (see McGaugh, 2000). The appar- ent difference in the role of the amygdala in classical and in- strumental learning of fear is a major area of research today. Chemical approaches to learning and memory are recent. The possibility that protein molecules and RNA might serve to code memory was suggested some years ago by pioneers such as Gerard and Halstead. The RNAhypothesis was taken up by Hyden and associates in Sweden and by several groups in America. An unfortunate by-product of this approach was the “transfer of memory” by RNA. These experiments, done by investigators who shall remain nameless, in the end could not be replicated.

At the same time, several very productive lines of investi- gation of neurochemical and neuroanatomical substrates of
