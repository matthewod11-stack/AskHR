# Employee Attrition Prediction in the USA: A Machine Learning Approach for HR Analytics and Talent Retention Strategies

Improved Employer Brand: The recommended models can assist organizations in proactively resolving workers' issues and promoting a positive work atmosphere. As a result, the organization can enhance its employer brand. Consequently, this attracts top talent and minimizes the need for expensive and time-consuming recruitment efforts.

5.2.2 Benefits to the USA Economy Combating Labor Shortages: The US economy is presently confronting a tight labor market. As a result, Machine learning can assist the government in maintaining high-performing employees, reducing the impact of labor shortages, and maintaining business continuity.

Elevated productivity: The proposed can automate repetitive tasks across different sectors, liberating human workers to concentrate on higher-value activities. As a result, this leads to improved efficiency and overall productivity in the American economy.

Competitive Advantage: By employing the proposed models, consequently the government can affirm a significant competitive advantage, by retaining valuable and high-performing employees. As a result, this can lead to increased exports and a better overall position for the US economy in the global market.

Enhanced public service: The recommended algorithms can be employed to optimize government operations, predict attrition patterns and customize social services. This can result in a more equitable allocation of resources and better outcomes for US citizens.

5.3 How to Implement the Model Step 1: Define Business Problem and Data Needs-Business in the USA should first consider the specific business challenges confronting their respective organization and determine the data required to solve those challenges.

Step 2: Select the Right Model- The random Forest algorithm might be suitable for general classification with low error margins, while the Gradient Boosting algorithm could be appropriate for detecting positive case identification.

Step 3: Data Pre-processing and Preparation- Subsequently, the business analyst should resolve the outliers, inconsistencies, and missing values. Besides, the analyst should standardize data formats for algorithm compatibility.

Step 4: Model Training & Evaluation-Afterwards the business analyst should split the data into training, validation, and testing. As a result, the analyst should utilize the testing data to evaluate metrics such as precision, accuracy, and recall.

Step 5: Model Implementation and Monitoring: The business should track the metrics constantly and update the model with new data to avoid degradation.

- 6. Conclusion The focal aim of this research paper was to delve into the application of machine learning in terms of forecasting employee attrition and its ramifications for HR analytics and talent retention strategies. In this study, the investigator used Jupyter Notebook, an interactive platform for Python users, to design machine learning algorithms. The dataset utilized in this research was attained from the IBM Human Resource workforce attrition survey dataset. In the current research, the investigator proposed an array of machine learning models, most notably, a Decision Tree, Ada-boost classifier, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Classifier. By referring to the performance evaluation, it was evident that the Random Forest algorithm had the highest accuracy, followed by Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree respectively. AdaBoost had the lowest accuracy. Concerning precision, the Random Forest algorithm again had the highest precision followed by Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost accordingly. By implementing the proposed models’ organizations in the USA can identify high-performing employees at risk of quitting, and subsequently take proactive steps to retain them, saving significant organizational resources. Ultimately, the proposed machine learning techniques can assist the government in maintaining high-performing employees, reducing the impact of labor shortages, and maintaining business continuity.
