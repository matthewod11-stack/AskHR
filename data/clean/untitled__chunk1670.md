# PAI

The last of these six self-report questionnaires to become instruments is the Personality well-known assessment Assessment Inventory developed by Leslie Morey (1991, 1996). The PAI is intended to provide information relevant to clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and screening for is closely adult psychopathology, and in this respect modeled after the MMPI. Drawing on methodology used in constructing other inventories, however, Morey formu- lated his scales in terms of theoretical constructs and used rational as well as quantitative criteria in selecting his items. The PAI clinical scales are primarily symptom- oriented and, as in the case of the MMPI, more likely to as- sist in Axis I than Axis II diagnosis. In addition, however, the PAI features several scales directly related to aspects of treatment planning.
