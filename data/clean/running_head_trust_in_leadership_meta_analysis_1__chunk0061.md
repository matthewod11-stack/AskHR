# (Mayer & Gavin, 2005).

In contrast, when a leader does not inspire trust, a follower’s performance may suffer

as they allocate resources toward ‘covering their backs’ (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). Here, we aim

to test whether meta-analytic support exists for the role of trust as a key mediator in the

relationship between the different leadership styles and performance outcomes. We focus

specifically on task performance and OCB, as these are considered some of the most

important outcomes in the organisational behaviour context (Banks et al., 2017).
