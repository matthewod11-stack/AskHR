The institutes not only created a professional workforce of child developmentalists but also initiated some of the major longitudinal projects of the century. Some of these projects were highly specialized; others were more general. At Yale, Arnold Gesell (1880–1961) began his intensive studies of children’s motor development, while John Anderson at Minnesota provided detailed descriptions of personality de- velopment (Anderson, 1937). At Berkeley, two sets of lon- gitudinal studies began in the late 1920s and early 1930s focusing on a variety of aspects of development—intellec- tual, social, and motor (see Bayley, 1949; Elder, 1974). Sontag (1944), at the Fels Research Institute, also started a longitudinal study in the 1930s that lasted until the 1970s. The Fels project also used a broadband approach involving assessments of social, emotional, motoric, and physical de- velopment. These studies were largely atheoretical and descriptive; they provided important normative guidelines concerning early developmental timetables.
