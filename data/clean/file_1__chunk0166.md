conscious of the cases where men and women are treated differently while performing similarly.

While both employed and retired people tend to be more conscious of overall gender inequality, students might face less gender inequality or they may not yet have experienced it. Davis and Robinson (1991: 73) argued that retired people may see gender inequality as meritocratic in a way that it is a result of gender differences in talent, effort, and educational diplomas rather than a result of gender discrimination. According to the scholars, since gender inequality tends to be justified for retired people, they might unconsciously accept its existence and perceive it to a lesser extent than employed people and students. This argumentation was not supported in this thesis. Instead Shapiro’s and Kirkman’s (2001) anticipatory injustice model was relevant. According to the model, people’s perceptions match their schemata, which are based on their prior experience. The more experience people obtain, the more is the likelihood that they have experienced injustice and, thus, continually sees it. In contrast, the less experience people have, the less formed attitudes they possess, and the less is the likelihood that they perceive overall gender inequality. Since both employed and retired people in general have more experience than students, they were found to perceive overall gender inequality to a greater extent.

Overall, the finding that employed and retired people perceived overall gender inequality to a greater extent than students calls for additional qualitative research aiming at analyzing whether people with different occupational categorization perceive gender inequality differently. Mutual understanding of the existence of gender inequality among people from different occupational categorizations might be the key to achieving gender equality.

The second thesis objective was to identify factors that explain individuals’ and employees’ perceptions of gender inequality in their own workplace and in society. This objective was addressed in the first two papers. Table 3 lists the factors found to be significantly related to individuals’ and employees’ perceptions.

Both papers illustrated that gender significantly predicted employees’ perceptions of societal and workplace gender inequality and individuals’ perceptions of overall gender inequality. Female employees perceived gender inequality to a greater extent than male employees. This finding is somewhat obvious and is in line with the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999), which claims that men and women differ in their perceptions in part due to their differential roles and positions in society and organizations.

The finding that employees with full-time contracts perceived workplace gender inequality to a greater extent than employees with part-time contracts might be explained with occupational socialization theory (Smith and Rogers, 2000), according to which employees are socialized within work environment through training, organizational culture, and workplace rewards. Employees with full-time contracts socialize more within their work environments and, thus, hear more about possible cases related to gender inequality than employees with part-time contracts.
