When you’re assessing generalizability, it can be helpful to discuss the

mechanisms that might explain the results and whether they apply in

other contexts. You might ask things like, How similar is the setting

of this study to that of our business? Does the context or period of

the analysis make it more or less relevant to our decision? What is the

composition of the sample being studied, and how does it inﬂuence the

applicability of the results? Does the eﬀect vary across subgroups?

Overweighting a speciﬁc result. Relying on a single empirical ﬁnding

without a systematic discussion of it can be just as unwise as dismissing

the evidence as irrelevant to your situation. It’s worth checking for

additional research on the subject. Conducting an experiment or further

analysis with your own organization can be another good option.

Questions to ask include, Are there other analyses that validate the

results and the approach? What additional data might we collect, and

would the beneﬁt of gathering more evidence outweigh the cost of that
