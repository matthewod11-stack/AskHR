# source of motivation at work.

Since we published the original research in 2017, further research has

corroborated our ﬁndings and the results have been replicated and

extended in other studies. We’re now able to more deeply understand

the ways that family can play a role in motivation at work, as well as how

managers can apply our ﬁndings in their own organizations.
