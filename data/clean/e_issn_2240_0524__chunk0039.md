# 3.2 Correlations Matrix

In this research we have used the Pearson correlation matrix generated from SPSS, to find out to what extent the variables regarding different train ing methods are linearly linked to gender and age and how they affect each other. According to findin gs of Good, (2009) The Pearson correlation test is robust and it gives robust significance levels not relating to means and distribution levels from which statistics are taken.

Correlation analysis is done by means of the correlation coefficient, which gives us a value that

determines the size between two categories or variables. This correlation can take values from -1 to 1.
