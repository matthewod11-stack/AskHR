# HBR / Digital Article / How One Person Can Change the Conscience of an Organization

of one. In one example, a woman in a Fortune 50 company shared her

experience in transforming her unit in Brazil. After being promoted to

a senior position at headquarters, she saw the need for change, but

the politics were more intense, and her previous experience seemed

irrelevant. With unwavering focus, she pressed forward and succeeded.

In reﬂecting on her success, she noted that challenging the status quo

is a skill that one can develop, and it applies at every level. In another

case, a woman in a Fortune 500 company was promoted to oversee a

large but failing business line. The eight people who preceded her were

all ﬁred. She spent months examining the organization and formulated

a strategic plan. It required serious work at the top. Her boss said no.

Using all her acquired skills and courage, she led her boss until he was

ready to change. The organization turned around.

These stories remind us that while corporate transformations are

almost universally assumed to be top-down processes, in reality, middle

managers, and ﬁrst-line supervisors can make signiﬁcant change when

they have the right mindset.
