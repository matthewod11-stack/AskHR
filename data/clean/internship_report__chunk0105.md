## 3.1(cid:32)Human Resource Department (HRD) of Karnaphuli Group:

Human Resource Department is a vital aspect of HRM because the performance of an individual

in an organization is largely driven by the work atmosphere or work culture that prevails at the

workplace. A good working condition is one of the benefits that the employees can expect from

an efficient human resource team. HR development is extremely necessary because organizations

recognize that any value added to an employee is value added to the organization, and employees

are eager for the opportunities to develop their skills and add value to their companies.(cid:32) .

Karnaphuli Group considers employees as its asset whose value is enhanced by development,

emphasizing on individual potential and skills.
