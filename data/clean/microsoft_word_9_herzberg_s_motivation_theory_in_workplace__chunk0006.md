In this review authors will analyze Herzberg’s motivation theory as one of the content theories of motivation. It

attempts to explain the factors that motivate individuals through identifying and satisfying their individual needs,

desires, and the aims pursued to satisfy these desires. This theory of motivation is known as a two-factor content

theory. It is based upon the deceptively simple idea that motivation can be dichotomized into hygiene factors and

motivation factors and is often referred to as a “two-need system”. These two separate “needs” are the need to avoid

unpleasantness and discomfort and, at the other end of the motivational scale, the need for personal development. A

shortage of the factors that positively encourage employees (the motivating factors) will cause employees to focus

on other, non-job related “hygiene” factors. The most important part of this theory of motivation is that the main

motivating factors are not in the environment but in the intrinsic value and satisfaction gained from the job itself. It

follows therefore that to motivate an individual, a job itself must be challenging, have scope for enrichment, and be

of interest to the jobholder. Motivators (sometimes called “satisfiers”) are those factors directly concerned with the

satisfaction gained from a job.
