# Serve as mediator.

Having a forum where stakeholders can voice their interests improves

their mutual awareness, but it does not guarantee that stakeholders’

often divergent interests will be automatically aligned. That’s because

although all key stakeholders are necessary for the business model to

work, some are naturally more important than others and can therefore

exert their power in the forum to impose their interest. As an executive

at the center of the stakeholder nexus, you’re in a unique position to

mediate and identify compromises so that no stakeholder is favored at

others’ expense or blocks decision making.
