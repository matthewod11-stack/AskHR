Businesses that fail to learn the new rules of platform strategy

will struggle—when a platform enters the marketplace of a pure

pipeline business, the platform nearly always wins. That’s exactly what

accounted for 92% of global proﬁts in mobile phones, while most of

the giants that once ruled the industry, such as Nokia, Samsung, and

Motorola, made no proﬁt at all.
