# one another down.

How to avoid this mistake: Your role as a leader is to surface and validate the value in each

contribution (the “yes”) and then steer the conversation forward by

building on that value or tying it to the next point—whether you’re

agreeing, elaborating, or oﬀering a respectful challenge (the “and”).

The value your team members oﬀer could be passion, a fresh angle, or a

commitment to a shared goal. Occasionally, you might need to reframe

an idea to explain its merit to the larger group. But even when you

have to turn down an idea, starting with a “yes, and…” shows you’ve heard it and respect it. That aﬃrmation invites honest dialogue—the

raw material teams need to innovate and creatively problem-solve.

As an example, let’s say you’re in a meeting with HR leaders. You’re

discussing your current onboarding process when someone suggests an

idea you don’t agree with: “I think we should extend onboarding from

two weeks to a full month. Right now, it feels too rushed, and new

employees aren’t getting enough training.”
