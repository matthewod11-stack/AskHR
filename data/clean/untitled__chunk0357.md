material to the practicing community—policy issues, case histories, training and internship opportunities, and so forth. It was apparent that a truly professional practice–oriented journal was needed. The APA had just received a large grant from the National Science Foundation to develop new, innovative publications on an experi- mental basis. “The Clinical Psychologist” was about to be transformed into an “experimental publication” called Pro- fessional Psychology, with an editorial board made up of members from across subspecialty ﬁelds. The inaugural issue, fall 1969, contained “The Clinical Psychologist,” and the cover of the journal retained the logo that had been de- veloped for the newsletter. By the second issue of the quar- terly, “The Clinical Psychologist” was pulled out to be pub- lished separately.
