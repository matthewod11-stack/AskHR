# their evolving preferences.

People who think that AI is inﬂexible may believe that it will treat

every person identically, rigidly applying a one-size-ﬁts-all approach

that ignores an individual’s unique traits. Indeed, the more distinctive

consumers perceive themselves to be, the less likely they are to use AI.

In one study, for instance, the more exceptional participants thought

that their own ethical characteristics were, the more resistant they were

to an AI system that assessed moral qualities.

At the same time, there’s a delicate balance between ﬂexibility and

predictability. Even though adoption often increases when companies

highlight AI’s ability to learn and evolve, if users feel that the outputs of

the system are too unpredictable, the intervention could backﬁre.

A more adaptable AI system is also riskier since it allows a greater

spectrum of user interactions, some of which may not be captured in

the data used to train the AI. When AI is more ﬂexible, it increases the

possibility that people will use it in inappropriate ways and that in those

cases the algorithms might provide undesirable responses, creating new
