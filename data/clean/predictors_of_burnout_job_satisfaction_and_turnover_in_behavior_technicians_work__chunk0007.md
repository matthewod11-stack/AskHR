and resources by both employers and employees. As in the health care industry, loss of productivity and costs of hiring and training new staff places a financial burden on providers (Waldman et al. 2004). Further, high turnover may also nega- tively impact remaining employees’ morale and workload as experienced staff are replaced by untrained staff (Sulek et al. 2017). Finally, frequent turnover may disrupt the continuity of services, which may potentially have a negative impact on patients’ progress in treatment.

Identifying predictors of turnover may be beneficial to ser- vice providers as it gives providers areas to address proactive- ly to reduce turnover. Pertinent information may be gleaned from research on predictors of turnover and burnout in other demanding professions, like child welfare workers (DePanfilis and Zlotnik 2008; Kim and Kao 2014), direct- care staff in services for individuals with intellectual disability (ID) and DD (Gray and Muramatsu 2013; Hatton et al. 2001), and special education teachers (Billingsley 2004; Brunsting et al. 2014); however, working specifically with individuals with ASD poses unique challenges. For instance, teachers working with children with ASD have been found to experi- encegreater levels of burnout in comparison to teachers work- ing with children with ID and children who are deaf (Zarafshan et al. 2013).

The primary purpose of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of predictors of staff retention and turn- over for behavior technicians working with individuals with ASD. Due to the scarcity of this research, the current review was expanded to include predictors of burnout and job satisfaction as these factors have been linked to inten- tion to turnover (Kim and Kao 2014). Findings of the cur- rent review should be informative for hiring practices, on- going supervision, and support of behavior technicians working with individuals with ASD.
