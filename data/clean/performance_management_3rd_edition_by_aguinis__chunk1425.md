# Part III • Employee Development

- Increased awareness of expectations. Employees become very aware of others’ expectations about their performance. This includes not only the supervisor’s expectations but also the expectations of other managers, coworkers, subordi- nates, and customers.

- Increased commitment to improve. Employees become aware of what others think about their performance, which increases their commitment to improve because information about performance is no longer a private matter.

- Improved self-perceptions of performance. Employees’ distorted views of their own performance are likely to change as a result of the feedback received from other sources. In other words, it is difficult to continue to have distorted views of one’s own performance in the presence of overwhelming evidence that these percep- tions may not be correct.

- Improved performance. Although receiving information about one’s performance is not sufficient cause to improve, it is certainly a very important step. Thus, having information on one’s performance, if paired with a good developmental plan, is likely to lead to performance improvement.

- Reduced “undiscussables.”

360-degree feedback systems provide an excellent opportunity to coworkers, superiors, and subordinates to give information about performance in an anonymous and nonthreatening way. Many supervisors may feel uncomfortable about providing negative feedback, but a 360-degree system makes providing such feedback easier.

- Employees enabled to take control of their careers. By receiving detailed and constructive feedback on weaknesses and strengths in various areas, employees can gain a realistic assessment of where they should go with their careers.

Table 8.4 includes a summarized list of benefits that organizations can obtain from implementing a 360-degree feedback system. Consider how some of these benefits were realized when a system was implemented at Sonoco Products, a supplier of industrial and consumer packaging.23 First, two-thirds of the respondents to a survey indicated that their expectations about performance were clearer and that they were able to understand more clearly the link between individual performance and organizational goals. Second, respondents to this same survey also felt more responsible for managing their performance, which the company took as an indication that individuals also had a better understanding of their jobs and self-perceptions of performance. Overall, while we do not have evidence
