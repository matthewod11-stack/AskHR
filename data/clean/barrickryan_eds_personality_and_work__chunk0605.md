## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 199

- A moderator model, which exists when a construct at one level (team cohesion) is hypothesized to inï¬‚uence the relationship between two constructs at a different level (individual traits and individual performance)

- A frog pond model, which occurs when the effect of a con- struct at one level (an individual trait) is dependent on the rel- ative standing of that construct in a higher-order construct (team personality as expressed by an overall mean)

Several of the multilevel effects of personality in team settings can be summarized by looking at them in terms of this framework.
