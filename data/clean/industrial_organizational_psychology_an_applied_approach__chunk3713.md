 employees an average of $, per year in lost work time (Woodward, ). Organizational child-care programs usually fall into one of three catego- ries: on-site care, voucher systems, and referral services. In the first category, organizations such as Aflac Insurance, Lost Arrow Corporation (Patagonia), and Cisco built on-site child-care facilities. In the United States, less than % of organizations have on-site child-care centers, % sponsor off-site programs, and % offer a child-care referral service (SHRM, a). On-site facilities allow a parent to save commuting time because a separate stop at a child-care center is avoided; this also permits the parent to visit the child during breaks.

Some organizations fully fund the cost of child care, whereas others charge the employee the “going rate.” There are advantages to both the employee and the orga- nization that pays the full cost of a child enrolled in its facility. For example, the child-care cost can be used as a benefit, meaning that neither the employee nor the organization will have to pay taxes on the amount. Of course, tax laws may even- tually change the situation, but until that time, calculating child care as an employee benefit is financially rewarding for both the employee and the organization.

Although the employee response to such on-site programs has been over- whelmingly positive, on-site centers cost nearly $ million to start and more than $, per child to maintain. Because of such high costs, it is important to deter- mine whether these centers “pay off” by reducing such phenomena as employee turnover and absenteeism. According to Scarr (), secure child care results in reduced levels of absenteeism and tardiness. Positive evidence has been provided from six sources:

Intermedics, in Freeport, Texas, reported a % decrease in turnover and absenteeism. Prudential Insurance in Newark, New Jersey, reported $, in annual savings due to their child-care center. Bristol-Myers Squibb found that users of its on-site child-care center had fewer intentions to leave the company than did other employees. Banc One Corporation in Chicago found that users of on-site child-care centers had seven fewer days of absenteeism than nonusers. Scott and Markham () reported an average decrease of % in absenteeism for organizations that established on-site centers. Tioga Sportswear in New Jersey found a % decrease in turnover.

As one can imagine, it is difficult to conduct a well-controlled study on the effects of on-site child-care centers as researchers need measures of absenteeism, turnover, and so on before and after the implementation of the child-care center, as well as a control group with which to compare users of the child care center. Unfortunately, there have been few such studies. Even more unfortunate is that these few studies suggest that on-site child-care centers do not reduce absenteeism or increase performance (e.g., Goff, Mount, & Jamison, ; Miller, ).

A second avenue that can be taken with child care is to provide employees with vouchers to be used with private day-care centers. For example, the San Antonio, Texas, branch of Levi Strauss provides a $ monthly voucher for employees mak- ing less than $,. NationsBank offers a similar program. From the perspective of the organization, voucher systems alleviate both the high start-up costs and the high costs of liability insurance associated with on-site centers. From an employee’s perspective, this approach reduces the cost of private child care.

Unfortunately, there are several reasons this approach probably does not reduce employee turnover or absenteeism. First, an employee must still leave

work to visit a sick child or to attend parent conferences. Although the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) discussed in Chapter  allows an employee to take up to  weeks of unpaid leave to care for a sick family member, employees who leave work to care for their families leave a void that organizations may find difficult to fill. Furthermore, because only % of organizations provide paid family leave (SHRM, a), the financial loss to the employee can create tremendous stress and hardship. A second reason off-site child-care facilities aren’t optimal is that most private child-care centers operate from  a.m. to  p.m. Thus, employees who work swing or night shifts are not helped. Finally, there is a shortage of quality child care in many areas. Some corporations, such as the Fayetteville, Arkansas, branch of Levi Strauss, donate large sums of money to local child-care centers to expand hours or services. Others, such as Time Warner and SunTrust Bank, contract with outside vendors to provide emergency child-care services for chil- dren who are ill. Because it can be difficult to find child-care centers that will take sick children, employers such as the Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, Iowa, have contracted with local health care agencies to provide in-home care for their employees’ sick children. Interestingly, % of organizations allow their employees to bring their children to work in emergency situations in which child care is not available (SHRM, a).

The final avenue taken by organizations is to provide a referral service to quality child-care centers. This approach has been taken by both IBM and Digital Corporation. Although this is certainly a useful service, nothing about it would suggest that it would reduce either absenteeism or turnover.

Hallmark Cards, Inc. is an excellent example of a company with progressive child-care and family benefits. Hallmark allows employees to take six months of unpaid maternity and paternity leave, reimburses employees up to $, for the cost of adopting a child, helps employees locate care for children and aged par- ents, provides care for mildly ill children, holds parenting seminars, and provides alternative care arrangements for children out of school during holidays, inclem- ent weather, or teacher workdays.
