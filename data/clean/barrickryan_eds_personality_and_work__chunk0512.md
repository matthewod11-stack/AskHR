# Why Do Personality Traits Predict CWBs?

A basic premise of this chapter is that there are many ways in which personality traits may inﬂuence the occurrence of CWBs. In order to organize the hypothesized lines of causal inﬂuence, it is useful to draw a distinction between what we will term initiated CWBs and reactive CWBs. Initiated CWBs are, as the label implies, initiated by the individual to satisfy some need or motive. Individuals may initiate a counterproductive behavior (for example, steal from the organization) to satisfy a motive such as pleasure, greed, thrill seek- ing, risk taking, or attention seeking. Reactive CWBs, in contrast, are engaged in by the individual in response to some actual or per- ceived organizational event. In these cases, the behavior is engaged in to satisfy a motive such as retaliation, revenge, release, or escape. Several observations about this distinction are in order. First, any type of CWB could be initiated in some settings and reactive in others. One individual may steal to satisfy a need for risk taking, while another may steal in retaliation for perceived mistreatment by a supervisor. Thus, it is not the case that types of CWBs can be categorized as initiated or reactive. Second, any given CWB may be engaged in to satisfy multiple motives. Two individuals may both be seeking an outlet to react to perceived injustice but differ in risk-taking propensity; the one high in risk-taking propensity may choose theft as the means of retaliation, while the one low in risk- taking propensity may choose to extend work breaks.

This distinction between initiated and reactive CWBs is re- ﬂected in Figure 6.1, which is the organizing device for this chap- ter. As Figure 6.1 indicates, one manner in which personality traits
