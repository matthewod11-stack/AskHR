The utility of the newer forms of leadership is further emphasised in the incremental

predictive validity analysis, included in Table 5. This table reports variance explained in the

criterion (trust in the leader) by transformational and contingent reward leadership and the

incremental variance explained by each of the other forms of leadership (i.e., authentic,

servant, ethical, empowering, paternalistic, and abusive). Results demonstrate that each of

these six leadership styles explained significant variance in trust in the leader over

transformational and contingent reward leadership. The amount of additional variance

explained varied across the leadership styles. Abusive supervision explained the least

additional variance (6%). Ethical leadership and authentic leadership both explained 10%
