# Vertical Separation

Another route to strengthening the voice of the next generation

involves vertically separating decision-making bodies. One way to

longstanding practices in national governments. This structure would

include a lower chamber whose role it is to propose novel policies, and

an upper chamber, which either approves them or suggests alterations.
