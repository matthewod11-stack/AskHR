## **Step 2: Assess the potential impact of the bug.**

The bug in the contact form could allow an a(cid:459)acker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the website. This could lead to the a(cid:459)acker being able to take control of the website, steal sensitive information, or deface the website.

The sender of the email claims to be a hacker named Harry. However, there is no way to verify the senderâ€™s identity.

link or downloading a malicious (cid:450)le.

**Conclusion: IMPORTANT** Based on the potential impact of the bug and the credibility of the sender,

the email should be classi(cid:450)ed as **IMPORTANT**. The recipient should take immediate action to (cid:450)x the bug and protect their website from a(cid:459)ack.
