# Deﬁnitions of resistance

Schein (1988) believes resistance to change to be one of the most ubiquitous of organisa- tional phenomena. A number of authors have deﬁned resistance. For example, Ansoff (1988, p. 207) deﬁnes resistance as a multifaceted phenomenon, which introduces unantici- pated delays, costs and instabilities into the process of a strategic change, whilst Zaltman and Duncan (1977, p. 63) deﬁne resistance as any conduct that serves to maintain the status quo in the face of pressure to alter the status quo.
