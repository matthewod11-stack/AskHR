# Master Adaptivity

Diﬀerent conﬂicts demand diﬀerent diplomatic tools. An approach

that works for resource disputes might fail utterly for identity-based

clashes. Expert mediators develop diverse intervention strategies—

such as shuttle diplomacy, where intermediaries carry messages

between disputing parties; multitrack engagement, which involves parallel eﬀorts across government, business, and civil society; and

peace corridors, which create designated safe zones for dialogue and humanitarian eﬀorts amid active conﬂict.
