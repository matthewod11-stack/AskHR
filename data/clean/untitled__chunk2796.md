## PSYCHOLOGISTS’EVOLVING STAND ON SOCIAL ISSUES

In the post–World War II era, social issues outside the labora- tory became major areas of applied psychological research (e.g., Cantril, 1949). Klineberg (1964, 1967) noted the pio- neering efforts of Claparède in Switzerland and Flugel in England in supporting psychological approaches to conﬂict resolution in international relations. He went on to summa- rize the endeavors of the World Federation for Mental Health and the contributions of psychologists led by him in the UNESCO project “On Tension Affecting International Understanding.” In 1965, Klineberg fostered “An Appeal to Psychologists,” urging the wider dissemination of relevant information available to psychologists and encouraging fur- ther research through “close and effective cooperation” with colleagues in other countries.

In subsequent years, psychologists increasingly recog- nized their responsibility to participate in social policy re- search and service activities with longer-term potential for affecting the well-being of society. The etiological impor- tance of socioeconomic conditions inﬂuencing human be- havior received more attention than in earlier years (e.g., David 1986; Kennedy & David, 1986). In his presidential

address at the 1978 International Association of Applied Psychology (IAAP) Munich congress, Fleishman (1979) re- ﬂected on the possibilities to apply psychological research and knowledge to pressing global social problems. Triandis (1994) stated a similar theme in his inaugural address at the 1994 IAAP Congress in Madrid when he stressed the need for cooperative research on intercultural conﬂict resolution and reproductive behavior. Issues of drug and alcohol abuse, violence, women’s rights, and responsible parenthood gained the attention of psychologists (e.g., David, 1994). There was a realization that policy makers sought more than scientiﬁc conclusions. They wanted recommendations for making de- cisions.Applied research began to move beyond determining why something is so to how it could be changed and at what cost.

Recent years have seen a continual increase in research related to socially signiﬁcant problems of international inter- est (e.g., Fleishman, 1999). Through diverse programs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, psychologists became involved in such humanitarian endeavors as design- ing psychological ﬁrst-aid programs for children trauma- tized by civil strife and war, facilitating mental health and health policy deliberations, and treating survivors of war trauma and torture (e.g., Hanscom, 2001; Kapor-Stanulovic, 1999).

One speciﬁc example of psychologists’ involvement in social change is the case of South Africa beginning in the 1980s when the world became increasingly aware of the injustices of the apartheid system. The presence of apartheid resonated strongly for U.S. psychologists, especially among African Americans, other psychologists of color, and Jewish immigrants who had come to the United States from pre- and post-World War II Europe.

The APA began to take action in 1981 when its ﬁnance committee divested its holdings in ﬁve corporations with direct assets in South Africa and agreed to bar future South African investments until further notice. In 1986, the APA issued a resolution urging “American psychologists to refuse to collaborate in projects sponsored by the South African government until human rights reforms are instituted.” Strictly interpreted, this resolution virtually prohibited inter- action with South African psychologists, regardless of race, since all the country’s universities and clinics were govern- ment sponsored.

Over the years, the APA resisted a number of pleas to amend the resolution and generally declined invitations, even from black-sponsored organizations, to go to meetings in South Africa. The sole exception were several planning meetings—convened by the culturally diverse and represen- tative Psychology and Apartheid Committee—which led to
