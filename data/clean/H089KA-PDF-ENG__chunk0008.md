## women of color in technology as part of my dissertation research.

From March to April 2023, I subsequently conducted 12 interviews

with women of color in technology with diversity in position, tenure,

role, ethnicity, company, and location. Each participant was assigned

a pseudonym to protect conﬁdentiality. The goal of the study was to

measure the level of workplace belonging reported, the top belonging

contributors and detractors, and to identify recommendations to

increase it. Here is what I found.

The average self-reported sense-of-belonging score was mediocre at best.

On average, women of color survey participants ranked their sense of

belonging a 6.7 out of 10, approximately 1.6 points lower on average than

their peers, based on extrapolated data from comparably.com.

Participant scores ﬂuctuated according to ethnicity but were not

statistically signiﬁcant due to a low sample size. Asian or Paciﬁc

Islander women reported the highest sense of belonging, with an

average score of 7.2 and a median of 8.0. Hispanic or Latina women

scored lower at 6.5 on average, and a lower median at 6.0. Black

women scored slightly lower with an average of 6.3 and median at

7.0. However, there may be a correlation with ethnic representation as

Asian women comprise 7% of technology professionals with the highest

belonging scores in comparison to Black (3%) and Hispanic/Latina (2%)

representation, according to Zippia’s women in technology statistics.
