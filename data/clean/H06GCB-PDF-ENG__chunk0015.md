# Bridge intersections.

Avoid participants tuning out of topics not related to their speciﬁc

departments by asking them to think about ways their work connects.

For example, “How does what Suneeta shared impact plans for your

department?” “What do you think the IT team will say when we

communicate Y?” or “What do the goals of project X have in common

with your objectives?” Deliberately bridging across departments

increases the relevance of the discussion for a broader set of attendees.
