# 11.3 Constraints:

(1) Difficulty in measuring workplace culture: Workplace culture is a complex construct that

can be difficult to measure accurately using standardized tools.

(2) Subjective nature of mental health: Mental health is a subjective experience and can be

difficult to quantify objectively, which can affect the reliability of research findings.

(3) Potential for response bias: Participants may be reluctant to provide honest responses regarding their mental health status or workplace culture due to social desirability bias or fear of repercussions.

(4) Limited generalizability: The external validity of the research may be constrained by the fact that the results of a single cross-sectional study may not be generalizable to other groups or circumstances.

(5) Potential confounding variables: Other factors such as personal life events, pre-existing mental health conditions, or environmental stressors could impact mental health outcomes, making it difficult to isolate the impact of workplace culture alone.
