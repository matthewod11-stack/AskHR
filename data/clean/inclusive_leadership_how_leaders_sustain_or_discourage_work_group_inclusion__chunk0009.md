Our departure supports our efforts to describe the experience of members of marginalized social identity groups who may encounter exclusion, even in a work group in which the leader behaves in- clusively with majority members. Note however that we cite prior literature on leader inclusion as it provides valuable insights into the ways in which in- clusive leadership is shown.

The leader plays a very inﬂuential role in the work group and their treatment of individual employees is a signal as to the degree of inclusion afforded, or whether the employee is expected to assimilate, is a recipient of differentiation, or is excluded. Below, starting with leader inclusion, we ar- ticulate each of the leadership approaches for the four quadrants of the Shore et al. (2011) model of inclusion. We describe the leader’s motives and styles that contribute to each of these categories of group membership and the effect of each of these group membership types on employees. We conclude with the implications of these four leadership orientations for organizations.
