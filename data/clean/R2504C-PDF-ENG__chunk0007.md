have to keep working on strengthening the parts of your culture that you

see being stretched.

So what does that look like in practice?

It comes back to the notion of wanting to operate like the world’s

largest startup. We looked at our culture and identiﬁed a few things.

Historically, Amazon has hired smart, ambitious, motivated people. We

let them make the lion’s share of what we call “two-way-door decisions”

—if you walk through it and you’re wrong, you can always walk back, no

harm done. (In a one-way-door decision, if you walk through the door

and you’re wrong, it’s really hard to walk back.) But as you get larger,

as we have, you end up logically with a lot of managers and a lot of

layers of managers. There’s a pre-meeting for the pre-meeting for the

pre-meeting for the decision meeting. And owners who don’t feel like

they own the decision to make a recommendation because they know

the decision will be made three levels up. We want them to own the

two-way-door decisions and be able to move quickly and autonomously.

It’s part of our eﬀort to increase the ratio of individual contributors to

managers by at least 15%. We want to ﬂatten the organization in order to

move faster and to drive more ownership.

What’s your advice for companies that want to break down their own layers of complexity in order to innovate quickly and effectively?

The ﬁrst step is to want to address it, which isn’t simple because you

get used to operating in a certain way. The leadership team has to

decide they actually want to change things and resolve to take action.

That requires getting visibility into what’s really happening. When we

announced that we wanted to ﬂatten and have fewer managers, we

started a “no bureaucracy” email alias, and we encouraged anybody

in the company who thought they were experiencing bureaucracy to

email me. I’ve received more than 1,000 emails in six months. Not all of

them are about bureaucracy—sometimes people just tell me they don’t

like their manager. But I’ve read every one and shared them with other
