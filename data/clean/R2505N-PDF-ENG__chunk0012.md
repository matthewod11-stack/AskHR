# lower-level tasks.

Recently, we surveyed this group to ﬁnd out what was tripping them up.

From their stories, we realized that many needed a refresher on which

tasks to retain and which to give to others. A how-to on that is outlined

below. But we also identiﬁed four challenges that stop even those who

know how to delegate from doing it successfully: an addiction to the

dopamine hit of easy productivity, a disinclination to reject requests

for help, a desire to meet their own bosses’ or clients’ unmanaged

expectations, and a misunderstanding of what “work” should mean for

a manager. Drawing on research and my own two decades of experience

advising senior leaders, I’ve developed concrete recommendations for

overcoming each challenge.
