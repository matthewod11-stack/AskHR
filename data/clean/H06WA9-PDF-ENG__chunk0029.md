# advancement.

Other parts of the world don’t necessarily label generations this way;

instead, specific age cohorts often acquire a name when their births or

childhoods coincide with events of particular culture relevance. Examples

include the “little emperors” of China, born during the country’s one-child

policy; the “born frees” of South Africa, who arrived after apartheid ended;

and Kenya’s Uhuru (“freedom”) Generation, born after the country gained

independence. In Sweden cohorts tend to be grouped by decade, but even

that can spark tension. Notably, a politician stirred controversy in the early

2000s by coining the name köttberg, or “meat mountain,” to describe

workers born in the 1940s, whom he saw as limiting youth employment.

Around the world, those born recently (such as late Gen Zers and

Generation Alpha in the United States) are being shaped by the Covid-19

pandemic. Their early experiences of life, school, and their parents’

jobs have mostly been in lockdown and on Zoom. So their ideas and

expectations of the workplace will almost surely differ — dramatically —

from those of the generations that preceded them.
