# 02 Onboarding and training

A structured onboarding process is vital for setting new employees up for success. If the onboarding experience is brief, disorganized, or fails to clarify expectations, employees may lack essential knowledge, skills, or direction. Incomplete training can leave new hires confused or unsure about key processes, leading to a slower adjustment and higher error rates. This lack of preparation often impacts an employeeâ€™s ability to perform well, making it difficult to recover later and increasing the likelihood of prolonged struggles that may eventually lead to an involuntary separation.15
