# Figure 1. Research model

distributed and collected through a drop-off and pick-up method, with a two-week time lag. Initially, participants filled in the part related to inclusive leadership and organizational learning. The questionnaires were collected, and after two weeks, the respondents received their questionnaires back and completed the extra-role behavior questions. The questionnaire was translated from English to Arabic using the back-translation technique (Brislin, 1986).

Thefirstpageofthequestionnaire includedacoverletter,whereit wasexplained the objectives of the study, provided an overview of the study variables and explained why this research is important for both the academic community and policymakers. All respondents were assured that their personal information would not be shared.

Concerning the demographics of the respondents, of the 227 respondents, 199 were males. The average age of theacademic staff was 41.5 years, with eight years’ experience in academia. The respondents were working in business colleges (20%), medical schools (10%), art and literature (30%), natural science (25%), engineering (5%) and languages (10%).

Measures Scales of inclusive leadership, innovative work behavior and organizational citizenship behavior were assessed using a seven-point Likert scale, where 1 indicates absolute disagreement and 7 indicates absolute agreement, whereas organizational learning was assessed by asking respondents to evaluate how good organizational learning dimensions are in their organizations on a 7-point Likert-type scale which ranged from “very bad ” to “excellent”.

Inclusive leadership. This construct was measured with nine-item scale from Carmeli et al. (2010) to assess the inclusive leadership of the deans who supervise academic staff. A sample item is “My supervisor is open to hearing new ideas”. The alpha reliability for this construct was 0.917.

Organizational learning. This construct was measured using seven items borrowed from Yang et al. (2004). These items represent the shortened version of the organizational learning dimensions. These were: continuous learning, team learning, empowerment, embedded system, system connection and strategic leadership. Previous research has utilized these items and reported good reliability (Joo and Shim, 2010; Tran and Choi, 2019). The alpha reliability for this construct was 0.894.

IWB. This construct was measured using a six-item scale from Scott and Bruce (1994). Althoughthisscalewasdesignedfortheassessmentofemployees’IWBbytheirsupervisors, employees assessed this scale themselves. This is consistent with previous studies (Cai et al., 2018; Montani et al., 2014). A sample item is “I generate creative ideas”. The alpha reliability for this construct was 0.882.

OCB.ThiswasmeasuredusingsixitemsborrowedfromWilliamsandAnderson(1991).A sample item is “I go out of my way to help new co-workers”. The alpha reliability for this construct was 0.886.

Control variables. following prior research (Shin and Zhou, 2003; Tran and Choi, 2019), the

authors have controlled for gender, age and experience.

Statistical analysis strategy Descriptive statistics, reliability measures and correlations were analyzed using SPSS v.24. To test the study hypotheses, the authors have utilized partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) (Hair et al., 2016). The authors utilized PLS-SEM as it has been widely used in different scientific disciplines, such as hospitality, human resource management, marketing and strategic management (Ali et al., 2018; Hair et al., 2011, 2012; Ringle et al., 2020). PLS-SEM technique measures the path coefficients through the ordinary least squares (Rigdon, 2012, 2016). Moreover, PLS-SEM deals with ordinal measures and correlated measurement errors (Rademaker et al., 2019; Schuberth et al., 2018), handles more outcome variables than classical regression techniques especially when the sample size is relatively small (Hair et al., 2012) and provides predictive accuracy when data do not follow a normal distribution pattern. In this study, 5000 sample bias-corrected bootstrapping technique with 95% confidence interval was utilized to check for the mediation effects.

Common method bias Commonmethodbiaswasassessedusingtwotechniques.First,theHarmansinglefactortest was employed. The results of the test generated four factors which did not load on a single factor, and the general factor did not explain the majority of variance (34.55%), which is below the suggested cutoff point of 50%. Another technique used was to evaluate the inner variance inflation factors using the PLS-SEM method. The results showed that the values of VIF ranged from 1.0 to 1.197, suggesting that there was no multicollinearity (Kutner et al., 2004) and that the data are not contaminated by common method bias. According to Kock (2015), if VIF are lower than 3.3, this indicates that the data are free of common method bias.
