# Anxiety and depression

Whether your anxiety or depression is chronic or short term, it can make

you more likely to avoid certain situations and prone to procrastination.

For example, you may ﬁnd yourself feeling extra sensitive to any

signs someone is not happy with your work, but you may also avoid

addressing it rather than tackling it head-on. If this sounds like you,

consider structuring your days to make avoidance and procrastination

more difﬁcult. For example, create short deadlines for steps in a project

rather than one deadline for the whole thing. Or, have a set time of

day when you take at least one small step forward with a task you’re

avoiding. Making progress on tasks you’d prefer to avoid will stop the

stress from getting even worse.
