## at a faster rate in terms of employment, payroll, and establishments for

the next six years. Previous research has found that this phenomenon —

called “up or out” — is how young ﬁrms create more jobs. Compared to

older ﬁrms, which show modest growth regardless of their size, young

ﬁrms and new entrants have more dynamic patterns that foster greater

job creation. Immigrant-founded ﬁrms display more of this behavior.

We are still in the process of uncovering why. We have identiﬁed

that the choices made by immigrants with respect to industry and

geographic location are an important part of the story—that is,

immigrants choose settings with heightened “up or out” dynamics.

But we don’t yet know whether this is due to greater risk tolerance

by immigrants, better skills and ethnic social networks for navigating

these settings, pure coincidence (i.e., immigrant happen to be arriving

in cities that are very dynamic), or something else.

If we use statistical methods to control for the location and industry of where a company is started, immigrant entrepreneurs are more likely

to survive than their native peers, but they’re only modestly more

likely to experience employment growth, and their payroll growth is

slower than that of native-founded ﬁrms. Thus, much of the growth and

volatility properties of immigrant ﬁrms result from where they decide

to found their companies. Among VC-backed start-ups, immigrant and

native entrepreneurs do not show meaningful diﬀerences in terms of
