## familiar jobs and interact with them directly.

Our doors opened in January 2016 to great local fanfare, and it was

exactly as we’d imagined. People were coming in; slowing down; receiving friendly, eﬃcient service; drinking great coﬀee; and, most

important, having meaningful personal exchanges with our team

members. And our customers weren’t just from the neighborhood. Some

saw the employee stories we shared on social media (“Look what Matt

did today!” “This is Joann’s ﬁrst job!”) and drove from all over the

country to visit the shop; others planned vacations to come see us.

Things were so busy that we quickly realized we’d need more space.
