Some Protestant theologians hold that work is inherently edifying. We would not go that far, but we do agree with the idea that work is an eﬀective place for ethical learning, for several reasons.

First, work plays a huge role in many people’s lives. Houses of worship, therapists’ oﬃces, and conversations with close friends and family are traditionally where moral learning occurs. We’re not suggesting that those settings are no longer relevant or important. But a typical full-time employee spends far more time at work than in a mosque, church, or counselor’s oﬃce. Indeed, many of us spend the majority of our waking hours there. How could work not aﬀect our moral thinking and actions?

The University of Washington’s Scott Reynolds has described a model of ethical decision-making based on research into how the brain processes novel stimuli. According to his model, we all have certain prototypes in our minds that guide our moral judgments. When facing a morally relevant situation, we automatically—often unconsciously—engage in a pattern-seeking process, looking to match the situation with one of our prototypes. If we ﬁnd a match, we make an intuitive judgment. We then use our more conscious, higher- order reasoning to justify that gut reaction.

When we face a moral decision for which we lack a prototype, our higher-order reasoning kicks in sooner, to
