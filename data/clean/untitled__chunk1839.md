# Sigmund Freud and Psychoanalysis

For most of the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) and his speculations on the origin of psychopathology had perhaps a more pervasive inﬂuence on both professional and popular opinion in the United States than any other single theorist.

Freud received his medical degree from the University of Vienna in 1881, later deciding to specialize in neurology. In 1885 he studied for six months at Charcot’s clinic at the Salpêtrière, where he was impressed by Charcot’s theory that hysterical phenomena are generated by ideas isolated

psychically in some second region of the patient’s mind that is separate from normal waking consciousness. In 1886, he began private practice, specializing in nervous diseases (predominantly hysteria). In this practice he used the con- ventional treatments for neurosis: massage, hydrotherapy, electrical stimulation, the rest cure, and hypnosis. Freud used hypnosis primarily to suggest to the patient that speciﬁc symptoms would disappear. He also used a “pressure tech- nique” in which he placed his hand on the patient’s forehead to elicit memories.
