# EARLY DEVELOPMENTS IN AMERICA

The subtle transition from philosophy and somewhat utopian worldviews to newer conceptions of psychology as the framework for understanding and applying educational vari- ables was introduced to America with William James’s (1842– 1910) 1891 lecture series at Harvard on the “new psy- chology.” These lectures were eventually turned into a book, Talks to Teachers on Psychology. This book is sometimes regarded as the ﬁrst popular educational psychology text, and there is evidence that this lecture series helped to spark the growth of educational psychology as a movement inAmerica. James spoke of psychology as a science and teaching as an art, but one that could beneﬁt from an understanding of psy- chological laws and human behavior. In addition, long before the so-called cognitive revolution in psychology, James intro- duced the idea that consciousness could control the direction of its own attention, thus setting the stage for later work in cognition and metacognition (Berliner, 1993; Hilgard, 1996; Wittrock & Farley, 1989).

One of James’s students, G. Stanley Hall (1844–1924), earned the ﬁrst PhD in psychology awarded in America. Although his degree was in psychology, Hall is most often remembered as an educator, a label he came by quite natu- rally. Hall, as well as his mother and father, taught school for some time. He went on to develop the ﬁrst research lab in America at Johns Hopkins, where he introduced another ﬁrst—fellowships for graduate students (Berliner, 1993). In Hall’s lab at Clark University (where he also served as presi- dent), he and his students systematically researched and doc- umented problems in higher education, thus establishing the ﬁrst formal graduate program specializing in education. This program was designed to furnish leaders to what was called a new educational movement in America, a movement that would facilitate the study of and research in education for years to come (Berliner, 1993).
