# xiv FOREWORD

none of them received any remuneration. They deserve our ap- preciation for engaging in a difÔ¨Åcult task for the sole purpose of furthering our understanding of organizational science.

We also express our sincere gratitude to Cedric Crocker, Juli- anna Gustafson, Matt Davis, and the entire staff at Jossey-Bass. Over many years and several volumes, they have provided support dur- ing the planning, development, and production of the series.
