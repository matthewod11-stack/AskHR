ER (β ¼ 0.164, p o 0.001). In the second step, organizational justice and climate of trust explained a positive and significant relationship (β ¼ 0.623, p o 0.001). The third step described that climate of trust and ER were positively and significantly related (β ¼ 0.604, p o 0.001). Finally, the results of the fourth step confirmed that climate of trust partially mediated the relationship between organizational justice and ER (β ¼ 0.540, p o 0.001). Hence, H1, H3, H5, and H6 were accepted.

Similarly, another mediation analysis was conducted for conflict management, which showed that conflict management was a positive and significant predictor of ER (β ¼ 0.162, p o 0.001). Furthermore, conflict management and climate of trust had a positive and significant relationship (β ¼ 0.436, p o 0.001). Finally, the results of the last step confirmed that climate of trust partially mediated the relationship between conflict management and ER (β ¼ 0.439, p o 0.670). Therefore, H2, H4 and H7 are accepted.

- 6. Discussion Thestudy aimed to analyze theeffect of organizational justice and conflict management on ER through the mediating role of climate of trust. Based on the study results, seven key findings have been identified and illustrated according to the hypotheses. First, it was confirmed that organizational justice revealed positive and significant relations with ER. This hypothesized link corresponds with the literature that supports finding exhibiting organizational justice predicts ER (Rupp and Cropanzano, 2002; Fein et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2017). Second, conflict management was found as a positive and significant predictor of ER. This finding is in line with the prior studies and stated that manager–employee relations are the consequences of appropriate conflict management strategy (Chen et al., 2005; Posthuma, 2011). Third, the relationship between organizational justice and climate of trust was found to be positive and significant. These findingscorroborate with priorstudies that stated that organizational justice is a significant predictor of climate of trust (Aryee et al., 2002; Katou, 2013).

Fourth, the dimension of conflict management presents a positive and significant relationship with climate of trust. Previously, it was researched that when an organization develops strategies for cooperative management of conflicts it enhances the level of trust between management and employees (Chan et al., 2008; Hempel et al., 2009; Masood and Javed, 2016). Fifth, the results revealed that climate of trust positively and significantly impacted ER. Trust is the most critical constituent for building an effective organization–employee relationship. This finding substantiates with the studies conducted earlier (Gill, 2008; Krot and Lewicka, 2012).

Sixth, the study outcomes showcase that climate of trust partially mediated the relationship between organizational justice and ER. Finally, it was found that the mediation effect of climate of trust was partial toward the relationship between conflict management and ER. Previously, researchers have analyzed the mediating role of trust with other constructs (Chan et al., 2008; Gaudencio et al., 2017; Katou, 2013; Jiang et al., 2015). In this study, climate of trust was initiated to perform the role of a mediator between organizational these findings offer an extensive and unique contribution to the existing literature that lacks empirical investigation.

justice and ER, and conflict management and ER. Therefore,

it was confirmed that the hypothesized relationships (H1, H2, H3, H4 and H5) proposed in this study are found to be positive and significant by revealing consistency with the extant literature. Although previous studies provide empirical evidence and support the findings of the current study, the authors have made a very unique attempt by introducing the items (provided in Table AI): “fair work schedule” and “fairness in promotion” (OJ), “appreciation for valuable suggestions” (CM) and “employer’s openness and reliability” (CT) as the potential dimensions for stimulating healthy ER in power sector utilities.
