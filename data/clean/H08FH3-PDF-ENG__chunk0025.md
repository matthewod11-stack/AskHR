# HBR / Digital Article / What Employers Get Wrong About How People Connect at Work

Our connection preferences can also wax and wane depending on

what’s going on in our lives. For example, an employee who previously

had a strong preference for colleague connection might get married,

take up an all-encompassing hobby, or experience some other life event

that materially alters their desire for partnership at work. While the

basic elements in each of the pillars are largely universal — meaning

that most employees expect the minimum requirements of working

with helpful peers and leaders, being respected in their jobs, and

working for a reputable company — the degree to which they want and

expect more will vary.
