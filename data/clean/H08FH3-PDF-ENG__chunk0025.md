# The Nature of CLEAR Connections

Akamai and NLI have been gathering and analyzing data to test

and reﬁne this framework using a combination of questionnaires and employee data. Early results suggest that diﬀerent employees have

unique needs surrounding each type of connection. One employee

might deeply value leader connection, spending a lot of time one-on-

one with their manager, not collaborating much with their peers, and

barely thinking about their organization’s mission. Their focus might be

on building a strong partnership with their leader and working together

to explore advancement opportunities. Motivating this person requires a diﬀerent path than the path for another employee who most highly

values colleague connection.
