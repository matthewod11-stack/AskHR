# Embrace disagreement as an advantage

Next, reframe disagreement as a necessity, not a risk. Speaking up

beneﬁts you, your boss, and the entire organization, says Wilding.

After all, when employees don’t challenge timelines, priorities, or

direction, companies waste money chasing the wrong goals. Being a

truth-teller can be a smart career move. “The higher leaders rise, the

more disconnected they become from day-to-day operations, and the

fewer people challenge them,” she says. You earn trust by speaking up,

even when it’s tough. “Your boss will see that you won’t mince words.

Done well, it can be an advantage.” Bordone adds that staying silent can

take a toll. “You’re going to feel frustrated, you won’t sleep well, and

your performance could suﬀer,” he says. “There’s a real ripple eﬀect.”

Gauge your “pushback power”

Disagreeing with your boss requires shifting from “a subordinate

mindset to a partnership mindset, where you recognize your

perspective is valuable and worth sharing,” says Wilding. The aim is

to be seen as a “trusted adviser,” not someone who just follows orders.

Wilding suggests evaluating your “pushback power”: your ability to

challenge decisions based on factors like tenure, your relationship

with your boss, and the state of the organization. Read the room: Is

the business in crisis, where decisions need to be made quickly, and

everyone must be on board? Or is it stable, with room for feedback? “It

doesn’t mean you can’t speak up if those factors aren’t in your favor, but

you may need to be more incremental in your approach,” she says.
