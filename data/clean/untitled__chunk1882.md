# The New Genetics

With the discovery of the double-helix DNA, the genetics of psychopathology passed from dependence upon inference from studies of twins to direct identiﬁcation of genetic anom- alies. One of the ﬁrst outcomes of genetic studies of the psychoses was the evidence that no one-gene–one-disorder relationship existed. In the case of schizophrenia alone, Gottesman and Moldin (1998) reported on several studies be- tween 1994 and 1997 that implicated seven different chro- mosomal regions in the genetics of schizophrenia.

Paradoxically, the increased sophistication of method provided by brain imaging and genetic analysis has not suggested that we are nearing a clear answer to the historic questions about the biology of mental illness. Instead it has gradually revealed the complexity of interactions between brain areas, the heterogeneity of brain anomalies in the psy- choses, and the heterogeneity of the genetic factors in what appear to be unitary diagnostic categories.
