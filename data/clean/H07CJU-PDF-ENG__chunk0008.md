## HBR / Digital Article / 5 Things Employers Get Wrong About Caregivers at Work

They are the fastest growing workplace identity group, and they make

up around 73% of the workforce. “Caregiver” is a broad term on purpose

— it includes parents, those caring for elderly family members, and

those supporting a sick or disabled child, sibling, or spouse. Through my

work as a journalist and consultant on caregiver issues in the workplace,

I see again and again that companies have serious blindspots about

their caregiver population and regularly make assumptions that can

undermine their stated values and goals — along with their bottom line.

Here are ﬁve big misconceptions I’d like to debunk in order for

companies to better understand the realities of their employee

caregivers so that they can make smart policies to support them.

Myth #1: School and childcare are “back to normal.”

Employers need to better understand the huge logistical care challenges

that employees may be facing daily. Before the pandemic, childcare

facilities were expensive and hard to ﬁnd, and public school was

completely out of sync with the realities of working parents. Sadly,

things are now far worse for everyone, making it harder than ever to

solve the care jigsaw puzzle.
