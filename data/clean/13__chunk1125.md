## Third Party Interventions across Cultures

Schwartz & Bilsky, 1990). Although there are undoubtedly other dimensions of culture that are important and relevant, we have limited most of our discussion to several dimensions that have been the subject of empirical research and we believe particularly salient to ADR procedural preferences. In this paper, we ﬁrst describe a range of widely used and cited third party procedures and present examples of where and how these procedures are implemented across different cultural contexts. We then suggest that procedural choice is built upon preferences across a number of key criteria from the literature, and explore the potential impact of culture on evaluations of these criteria. We argue that a given procedure may be viewed idiosyncratically through the lens of a given set of cultural norms. Thus criteria cannot be assumed consistent across cultures (Tinsley, 2004).1 We ﬁnish with a discussion of future directions for research and practice, emphasizing that procedural recommendations should be made carefully when the criteria for effectiveness and applicability are derived from US-centric research. This paper serves to stimulate thinking and research about how culture changes the implementation of ADR practices, emphasizing that there is not ‘‘one best choice’’ for third party procedures universal to the myriad cultures on our planet.
