## Part IV • Reward Systems, Legal Issues, and Team Performance Management

- 4. Use a multi-method approach to measurement. The measurement of team performance is complex. Thus, multiple methods and sources of data are often necessary.

- 5. Focus on process as well as outcomes. Behavioral/process-oriented measures as well as results are as useful for team performance management systems as for individuals. Thus, serious consideration must be given to how both types of measures will be used within the context of managing team performance.

- 6. Measure long-term changes. Although short-term processes and results are easier to measure, it is important to also consider long-term measures of performance. Team performance must be sampled over a variety of contexts and over time.

Recall the basic components of the performance management process as shown in Figure 11.2. You may recall that this same figure appears in Chapter 2. Now, let’s consider each of the components of the process when we design a system that includes team performance and let’s incorporate the six basic principles outlined above into the various steps in the process.
