# 74 Top MANAGERS AND CoRPORATE FINANCE

Behavioral considerations contribute to our understanding of corporate finance from

two perspectives: first, recognizing that markets make mistakes which managers

exploit; and, second, that managers make mistakes which markets do not fully

correct. In this section we assume the perspective most relevant to the economics of organizations and consider the possibility that top managers make mistakes.7° Managers are most likely to be affected in their judgment when they face decisions

in which three conditions hold:

Gi) decisions are not frequent and do not deliver clear feedback;

(ii) the manager does not specialize in making those decisions; and

(iii) managers are protected from market pressure and competition.

As for (i), the higher the level of a manager in the hierarchy, the less likely decisions

are to be repeated enough to learn from feedback. Large-scale investments, merger

agreements, or capital restructuring are relatively rare decisions, and the organiza-

tional framework of a company may not be optimized to facilitate them. It is also

hard to evaluate outcomes. For example, there is no agreed-upon methodology on

how to evaluate the long-run returns to mergers, even in the academic literature

(Andrade et al. 2001). Regarding (ii), the level of specialization is likely to decrease

the higher up in the hierarchy decisions are made. As Lazear (2004) formulates in the

18Experiments on slogan quality could use paradigms like the game “telephone.” In telephone, people form a circle and speak a phrase very rapidly into the ear of the person to their right, who repeats it rapidly to the person on their right, and so on. The goal is for a slogan or cultural principle to make it around the circle with the least degradation. One could also test the durability of shared memory of a slogan by announcing it to a group, then asking group members at future times whether they remember it, and whether they think others remember it. Good cultural principles will be remembered, and expected to be

remembered by others, over long spans of time.
