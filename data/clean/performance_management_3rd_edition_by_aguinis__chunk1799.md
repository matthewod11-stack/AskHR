## Chapter 10 • Reward Systems and Legal Issues

an important part of the job. In this case, the fire department should demonstrate that physical strength is a key KSAfor the job of firefighter and, based on the argument of business necessity, an appropriate measure should be included as part of the perform- ance evaluation and every employee should be evaluated in the same fashion. As a precautionary measure, data should be gathered on an ongoing basis regarding performance scores obtained by members of various groups, broken down by the categories indicated by the law (e.g., sex, ethnicity). A periodic review of these data can help detect the presence of adverse impact, and the organization can take corrective action if necessary.

- Illegal discrimination.

Illegal discrimination, also called disparate treatment, means that raters assign scores differentially to various employees based on factors that are not performance related, such as race, nationality, color, or ethnic and national origin. As a consequence of such ratings, some employees receive more training, feedback, or rewards, than others. This definition of illegal discrim- ination is given, for example, in the Race Relations Act of 1976 in the United Kingdom and in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States. Illegal discrimination is usually referred to as disparate treatment because employees claim they were intentionally treated differently because of their sex, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability status, or other status protected under the law.

The majority of legal cases involving performance management systems involve a claim of disparate treatment. What can an employee do if, for example, she feels she was given unfairly low performance scores and skipped over for promotion because she is a woman? To make such a claim, an employee can present direct evidence of discrimination, such as a supervisor making sexist comments that may have influenced the performance management process. Alternatively, she needs to provide evidence regarding the following issues:

- She is a member of a protected class. • She suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of a performance evalua- tion (i.e., was skipped over for promotion).

- She should not have been skipped over for promotion because her performance level deserved the promotion.

- The promotion was not given to anyone, or it was given to an employee who is not a member of the same protected class (i.e., another woman).

If an employee provides this kind of evidence, the employer must articulate a legit- imate and nondiscriminatory reason for not having given the promotion to this female employee. Usually this involves a reason that is clearly performance related. This is the point at which employers benefit from having designed and implemented a system that is used consistently with all employees. Such a system is legally defensible, and any decisions that resulted from the system, such as promotion decisions, are also defensible. We must distinguish illegal discrimination from legal discrimination. A good performance management system is able to discriminate among employees based on their levels of performance, and this is legal discrimination. A system that does not do this is not very useful. A good performance management system does not discriminate illegally. Illegal discrimination is based on variables that should not usually be related to performance such as sex, national origin, and ethnicity.
