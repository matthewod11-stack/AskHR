Let’s examine SEB’s strategic ﬁt between consumers and investors—

two stakeholder groups that some companies treat as rivals competing

for scarce resources. For SEB, an important measure of success is the

success of its members. According to nearly 1.5 million total body scans

in 2023, its customers collectively lost 1.57 million pounds of fat and

added about 872,000 pounds of muscle. The personal stories behind

such statistics are even more impressive. Runyon and Mortensen’s 2017

book Love Work describes a 69-year-old grandmother who recovered

from serious health issues and then set the Guinness World Record for

planking, an exercise in which a prone person balances on her toes and forearms while holding the rest of her body straight and oﬀ the

ground. It shares the story of a suicidal woman who lost 100 pounds and

regained her self-esteem, and of a gym owner who donated a kidney to a

member. Then there’s the story of a man who lost his legs and ﬁngertips

to ﬂesh-eating bacteria and was turned away by six competitor gyms.

Anytime Fitness trainers prepared him to participate in an endurance

race and carried him over the ﬁnish line.
