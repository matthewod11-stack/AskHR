eﬀorts externally. He’d spent much of 2020 both dealing with pandemic-related supply-chain delays and store closures and hammering out the company’s diversity policies and plans. He and Jackie Paquette, Juno’s CHRO, had launched programs focused on hiring, training, community support, and organizational culture, and by altering their promotion criteria and broadening their recruit- ment outreach, they’d increased diversity at headquarters. But that had yet to trickle up to the leadership team or the board.1 John Chang was the only board member of color. And although

“I deﬁnitely feel good about the options,” Alex said. “We’ve met with both of them several times over the past three months, and to be honest, I’m quite torn.” In fact, the choice had been keeping him up at night. From its start as a small Canadian toy maker 10 years earlier, Juno had become a multinational leader in its sector, with Asia driving its future in terms of both produc- tion and sales.2 This hire would assume most of the operational responsibilities so that John could focus on spearheading growth, but the newcomer would be another public face for Juno in the region and, as John’s likely successor, would be scrutinized— certainly by the company’s directors and employees, and potentially by DEI watchdogs, investors, and consumers. The problem was that Alex couldn’t quite ﬁgure out what qualiﬁed as diversity for Juno in Asia.

CATHERINE WU Ethnically Chinese, Catherine was born and raised in the United States by her parents, who had immigrated to New Jersey from Shenzhen as graduate stu- dents. After earning a degree in economics from Princeton, she joined a prestigious consulting ﬁrm, where one of her most successful engagements was with a global toy company. She soon developed a reputation as

an expert in toy manufacturing and distribution. Catherine had been pursued by several of Juno’s competitors but hadn’t yet been persuaded to go in-house anywhere. Alex was honored that she was considering this role, and he thought that getting her would be a big win.3

Catherine hadn’t lived in China or elsewhere in Asia for an extended period. But she’d visited family in mainland China and Hong Kong during school breaks, and after she’d started working, she’d taken business trips to the region every quarter or so. Through her consulting work she’d developed a network in Asia, primarily in Hong Kong, where her ﬁrm had an oﬃce.

She told Alex that she’d been

watching Juno’s performance before and after its IPO, in 2019, which had been small but established the company as an important industry player. He was impressed with her knowl- edge of their peer companies and her experience supporting one of them in the kind of expansion he wanted to see over the next ﬁve years. She’d led many of her ﬁrm’s larger projects and according to her references was adept at managing teams of people from diﬀerent parts of the world.

Alex had few concerns about

Catherine’s suitability for the job; his one hesitation involved her language skills.4 She spoke Mandarin with her family but not consistently in a business
