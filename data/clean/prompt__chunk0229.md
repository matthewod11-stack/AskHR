# Output

- 1. Let’s assume my current age is “x” years.

- 2. When I was 3 years old, my age was 3 years.

- 3. My pa(cid:457)ner’s age at that time was 3 times my age, which means my pa(cid:457)ner’s

age was 3 * 3 = 9 years.

- 4. Now, I am 20 years old, which means my age has increased by 20 - 3 = 17

years since I was 3 years old.

- 5. Since my pa(cid:457)ner’s age was 9 years when I was 3 years old, and my age has

increased by 17 years, my pa(cid:457)ner’s age must have also increased by 17 years.

- 6. Therefore, my pa(cid:457)ner’s current age is 9 + 17 = 26 years.

So, my pa(cid:457)ner is 26 years old.

Alright, now the (cid:450)nal answer is correct. That’s because we clearly instructed the LLM to

explain each step instead of just returning an answer. It’s interesting to see that the model

adds up the 17 increased years. In my head I would take the di(cid:441)erence of years between my

pa(cid:457)ner and me and add those up. (20+(9-3)). Let’s help the model to think a li(cid:459)le bit more
