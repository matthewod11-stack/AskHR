That moment ended the decades-long AI winter, put neural nets at the

center of progress, and revealed the playbook the ﬁeld still runs on.

First, gather relevant data—roughly 14 million labeled images in the

ImageNet case. Next, rely on metrics to quantify and drive progress.

Last, ﬂood a model with data and GPU muscle until it teaches itself, a

formula that has carried AI from categorizing objects to writing ﬂuent

prose and, most recently, to reasoning, planning, and wielding external

tools in today’s emerging “thinking” systems.
