research design consisted of a feedback group who received individualised feedback based on performance during the first task and before the team began completing the second task. This feedback consisted of self-ratings and peer ratings. They also utilised an exposure group who completed ratings on themselves and the other team members following completion of the first task. However, this group did not receive the feedback reports before the second task but were told that they would receive feedback at some future point. The third group acted as a control group and they completed a ``placebo instrument'' on the task content but did not complete self or peer ratings.

Dominick et al.'s (1997) findings point to

the conclusion that it is not so much the feedback itself that drives behaviour change but rather it is the exposure that the participants get to the behaviours by completing the feedback instrument that results in change. This finding supports research in upward appraisal cited earlier which found that employees can change behaviour merely by becoming aware of the behaviours that are rewarded in the organisation and that they do not have to receive individualised feedback reports to enhance performance (Smither et al., 1995b; Reilly et al., 1996).

In terms of assessing the impact of peer feedback on performance improvement and personal development, some important issues emerge. Dominick et al.'s (1997) findings question the effectiveness of peer feedback and thus multi-source feedback as a tool for facilitating employee behaviour change and performance improvement. Druskat and Wolff (1999) report that respondents indicated that peer feedback was not beneficial for their personal development. If it is found that mere exposure to valued behaviours within the organisation is enough of itself to instigate behaviour change, then it follows that effective communication of the valued behaviours by management to the employees would be sufficient to facilitate performance improvement. This finding calls into question why an organisation might invest extensively in 3608 feedback processes if it is not the feedback per se that predicts change but rather awareness of the desired behaviours on the job.
