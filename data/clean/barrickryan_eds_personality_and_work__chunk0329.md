prosocial values. Other correlations were very small. These results indicate that certain motives for engaging in citizenship perfor- mance contribute uniquely to the prediction of citizenship per- formance and can be predicted by personality variables.

Barrick et al. (2002) developed a measure of three psychologi- cal motives: accomplishment striving, status striving, and commu- nion striving (that is, getting along with others). Although they referred to these variables as intentions or goals, the variables bet- ter ﬁt the deﬁnition of motives because of their lack of speciﬁcity (these motives would lead an individual to choose a speciﬁc goal). The authors found that Conscientiousness and Extraversion were related to both accomplishment striving and status striving, Emo- tional Stability was related to status striving, and Agreeableness was related to communion striving. These motives mediated the rela- tionship between the personality variables and a measure of sales representative job performance.

Chan and Drasgow (2001) developed a measure of motivation to lead, which ﬁts in the motive component of motivation because it is deﬁned as an individual difference construct that inﬂuences decisions to participate in leadership activities and intensity of ef- fort. Each Big Five personality variable was found to be a signiﬁcant predictor of at least one of the three factors of motivation to lead.
