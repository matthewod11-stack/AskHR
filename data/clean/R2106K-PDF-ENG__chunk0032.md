## However, many employees—especially those new to an

industry or an organization or to work itself—lack experi- ence with or training about the unique ethical issues that may arise on the job. Approaching the workplace as a moral laboratory, then, requires giving employees opportunities to learn from new experiences, both simulated and real. The goal is to help them build prototypes that they can apply to an array of circumstances.

One way to do this is through experiential training. Whereas traditional teaching is didactic (think of a text- book, or a teacher at a blackboard), experiential training is hands-on and immersive, with the teacher playing a guiding role. To learn the laws of buoyancy through experiential training, for example, one would build a boat rather than read Archimedes.

Honestly contemplating one’s actions can be an uncom- fortable process. But a now-familiar management concept can help overcome resistance to doing so: psychological safety, or an environment in which people aren’t afraid to speak up, ask questions, admit mistakes, and seek help. Organizational leaders can create psychological safety by framing workplace ethics as a learning process and acknowl- edging that we must learn from failures as well as successes. Managers can encourage employees to speak up when they witness moral indiscretions. They can reassure workers that it’s OK to ask questions when facing moral uncertainties— preferably before making any consequential decisions. And they can model humility by acknowledging that they don’t have all the answers.

Despite its proven eﬀectiveness in academia and in corporate training programs, experiential learning has been slow to catch on as a tool for organizational ethics and compliance training. When researchers examined the ethics training at 71 large U.S.-based companies, they found that much of it was delivered in short doses and infrequently, such as annually or only during new-hire orientations. And often the training was solely online or lecture-based.

Of course, psychological safety is not a green light allow- ing employees to make as many egregious mistakes as they want to. Clear violations of ethical standards should be han- dled promptly and punished consistently. Research shows that tolerating unethical behavior sends the wrong signal to employees and can spark further misdeeds. Having a psycho- logically safe environment for ethical learning doesn’t mean granting deviants free rein; it means giving well-intentioned people a space where they can learn through reﬂection.

What would an eﬀective experiential-training program look like? Companies could regularly oﬀer classroom-based programs using real-world case studies. At Lockheed Martin, employees watch videos of scenarios involving everyday eth- ical challenges they might encounter at work. Small groups discuss the scenarios and explore techniques for upholding moral values, such as asking questions, reframing issues to take various perspectives into account, and developing guidelines about when and how to report violations.
