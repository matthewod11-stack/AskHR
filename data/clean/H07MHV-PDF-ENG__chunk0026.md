I couldn’t pass the mathematical requirements to pursue a career in veterinary work, but given my visual aﬃnity with animals and insight

into their behavior, I now train veterinarians.

The business and industrial worlds need all kinds of diverse minds.

There is an increasing number of examples where neurodiverse

employees have been the key to successful implementation. For

example, a company that was critical to the success of the latest

Mars rover is Illinois-based Forest City Gear, which worked with NASA

to create the tiny gears that turned the camera. Precise tolerances

were required to survive the harsh Martian conditions. To execute,

extraordinary attention to detail was needed. The perfect candidate for

the job could be a person with autism.

Today, we’re starting to see exciting new eﬀorts to create job

opportunities for all kinds of thinkers. For example, Dr. Ivan Rosenberg

started a unique program with the College of the Canyons in Santa
