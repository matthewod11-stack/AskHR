## Fig. 14 Examples of overall EX metrics across the employee journey

Another methodology and set of metrics was selected by Jacob Morgan. He was

evaluating 252 organizations with 17 questions in scale from 1 through 5 where 1

means strongly disagree and 5 means strongly agree. The whole survey was

constructed in way to capture the physical environment, starting with four questions,

then the next ten questions are dedicated to cultural environment, and finally three

questions analyze the technological environment. He also added weight to each

applied environment to get total comparable scores.
