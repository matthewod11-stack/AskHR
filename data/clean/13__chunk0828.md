Wyer and Collins’ (1992) Theory of Humor Elicitation The foundations of incongruity theory are used as a jumping-off point for Wyer and Collins’ (1992) development of a number of additional theoretical principles for describing the cognitive mechanisms behind humor elicitation. Although a thorough description of their entire theory is beyond the scope of this paper, we describe ﬁve of their important principles. The ﬁrst two are related, and are termed non-replacement and diminishment. The principle of non-replacement refers to the notion that the initial expectation system associated with the referent elicited by a humorous stimulus (e.g., a joke or cartoon) is not negated by the introduction of a second expectation system. For example, in the ‘‘ﬂy in my soup’’ joke above, the customer’s presumed disgust is not forgotten or ‘‘replaced’’ by the elicitation of the second expectation system (i.e., the motives of the ﬂy to eat the soup and its limited digestive capacity). Rather, Wyer and Collins (1992) proffer a second principle, diminishment, which suggests that a humorous stimulus is
