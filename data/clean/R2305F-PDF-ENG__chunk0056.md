“Speed-dating” sessions. If team relationships are closer, you may be

all team members report back to the group on one helpful piece of

feedback they received that they will act on.

Live 360-degree feedback circles. If you have a mature team with

strong relationships, get members together over a meal and take turns.

team member gives me feedback. Once we’ve completed the circle, we

takeaway from the feedback received.

Exchanging feedback in front of a team requires courage but oﬀers clear

advantages. It stops members from whispering behind one another’s

you see it’ll be ﬁne. Because everyone is watching, people are careful
