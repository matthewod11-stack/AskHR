# How to Address the Silo Effect

Businesses must ﬁrst determine whether silos require immediate action

or a long-term strategic solution. Severe issues—such as customer service delays, cost overruns, or operational ineﬃciencies—may

necessitate short-term ﬁxes. A focused team led by senior management

can facilitate communication and ensure critical information ﬂows.

However, this provides only temporary relief, as misalignment, elitism,

or self-preservation behaviors will likely resurface. While useful for

stabilizing operations, short-term measures must lay the groundwork

for addressing root causes through strategic interventions.
