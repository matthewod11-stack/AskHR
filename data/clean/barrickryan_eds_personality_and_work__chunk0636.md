# Centrality

The concept of betweenness centrality has been shown to predict the most powerful actors in a network (Brass, 1984; Krackhardt, 1990), as well as the success of individuals and groups (Sparrowe et al., 2001). It is also a key component of social capital and effec- tive leadership in organizations (Brass & Krackhardt, 1999). Cen- trality refers to how central an individual is relative to others in a network. An individual who connects with those who are otherwise unconnected is considered to have high betweenness centrality and thus occupies a structurally advantageous position in the net- work. In more formal terms, betweenness centrality measures the frequency with which an individual falls between other pairs of net- work actors on the shortest (geodesic) paths connecting them (Freeman, 1979).

Recent research demonstrated that high self-monitors were more likely to have greater network centrality than low self-monitors and that high self-monitoring and central network positions con- tributed independently to predicting individual work performance (Mehra et al., 2001). One means of gaining a position of central- ity in a network is to make lots of connections (create a large net- work); however, this is not a very efÔ¨Åcient strategy. Creating and maintaining network ties requires a substantial investment in terms of time and energy. High self-monitors, in their eagerness to please others and create good impressions, may tend to agree to be part of many project teams, thereby imperiling their overall work per-
