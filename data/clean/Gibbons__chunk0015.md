### **[Building your first hybrid team]{.underline}**

[How can you get started? Here\'s a roadmap to follow:]{.underline}

- [Start small. Choose a process with clear boundaries and measurable
 > outcomes. Customer service, content creation, and data analysis
 > are good candidates. Avoid starting with high-stakes, ambiguous,
 > or emotionally charged work (Gartner, 2024).]{.underline}

- [Define roles explicitly. Document what AI agents will do, what
 > humans will do, and --- critically --- what they\'ll do together.
 > Be specific about decision rights, escalation triggers, and
 > handoff protocols.]{.underline}

- [Create feedback loops. Hybrid teams improve through iteration.
 > Build mechanisms for humans to provide feedback to AI agents and
 > for AI agents to surface patterns in human
 > decision-making.]{.underline}

- [Invest in translation layers. Humans and AI agents speak different
 > languages. You need interfaces --- both technical and procedural
 > --- that allow them to communicate effectively.]{.underline}

- [Prepare for resistance. Some team members will fear AI agents as
 > threats to their jobs. Others will over-rely on AI, abdicating
 > critical thinking. Address both extremes through clear
 > communication about how hybrid teams enhance rather than replace
 > human capabilities.]{.underline}
