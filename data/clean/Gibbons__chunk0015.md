### **[The orchestration advantage]{.underline}**

[The magic of hybrid teams isn\'t in the individual capabilities of
humans or AI agents. It\'s in orchestration --- coordinating their
complementary strengths to achieve outcomes neither could accomplish
alone.]{.underline}

[Consider how modern financial trading firms operate. AI agents monitor
markets 24/7, executing trades within defined parameters. Human traders
set strategy, adjust parameters based on world events, and handle
exceptional situations. Neither could achieve the same results alone ---
it\'s the orchestration that creates value (Bank for International
Settlements, 2024).]{.underline}

[This orchestration requires what I call \"handoff design\" ---
deliberately structuring how work flows between human and artificial
team members. Each handoff needs clear triggers (when does work
transfer?), complete context (what information needs to be passed?), and
defined expectations (what should the receiving party do?).]{.underline}
