For example, Holiday Inn has empowered each of its employees to take any reasonable means necessary to satisfy a customer. This decision was made so that an unhappy guest can have his problem solved immediately rather than passed on to a manager. So if a guest complains to a housekeeper that there were not enough towels in his room, the housekeeper is empowered to deal with the situ- ation. The housekeeper might opt to apologize, or she might opt to take $ off the night’s stay. Let’s imagine that a particular housekeeper “comps” (“compen- sates,” or gives for free) a night’s lodging for each of ten people who complained about not having enough towels. The manager thinks that this decision was excessive and fires the housekeeper. What effect will the firing have on future employee decisions?

When employees are empowered to make decisions, they must first receive some training in how to make them. Rather than punishing an employee who makes a bad decision, it is better for the organization to discuss with the employee what might have been a better decision and to explain why the employee’s deci- sion was improper. Without such training and coaching, employees are not likely to enthusiastically accept their newly empowered status, especially if their new level of authority is not accompanied by an increase in pay.
