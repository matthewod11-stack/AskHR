## EXPERT OPINIONS ON THE NATURE OF INTELLIGENCE

Historically, one of the most important approaches to ﬁguring out what intelligence is has relied on the opinions of experts. Such opinions are sometimes referred to as implicit theories, todistinguishthemfromthemoreformalexplicittheoriesthat serve as the bases for scientiﬁc hypotheses and subsequent data collections. Implicit theories (which can be those of laypersonsaswellasofexperts)areimportanttothehistoryof a ﬁeld for at least three reasons (R. J. Sternberg, Conway, Ketron, & Bernstein, 1981). First, experts’ implicit theories are typically what give rise to their explicit theories. Second, much of the history of intelligence research and practice is much more closely based on implicit theories than it is on for- maltheories.Mostoftheintelligenceteststhathavebeenused, forexample,arebasedmoreontheopinionsoftheircreatorsas towhatintelligenceisthanonformaltheories.Third,people’s everyday judgments of each other’s intelligence always have been and continue to be much more strongly guided by their implicit theories of intelligence than by any explicit theories.
