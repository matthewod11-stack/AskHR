# SUSAN: No problem.

JASON: SUSAN: What? I worked as hard as I could! It wasn’t my fault that the other people

You did miss three of the other objectives.

on the team did not carry their weight.

JASON:

SUSAN:

JASON:

Susan, I am not here to blame anyone or to attack you. I want to generate some ideas on what we can do to ensure that you meet your objectives and receive your bonus next quarter. SITTING BACK WITH CROSSED ARMS: I told you I worked as hard as I could. I know that you worked hard, Susan, and I know how hard it is to balance all of the objectives that we have in our department. When I first started, I had a hard time meeting all of the objectives as well.

SUSAN:

It is hard and I try my best.

JASON:

Susan, can you think of anything that we can work on together that would help you meet the last three objectives? Is there any additional training or resources that you need?

SUSAN:

I am having a hard time prioritizing all of my daily tasks. There is a class offered online on prioritizing, but I feel I am too busy to take it.

JASON:

That is good that you think the class will help. Take the class online, which will not disrupt your work schedule, and I will go to all of your meetings and follow up with clients as needed.

SUSAN:

Thanks, Jason. I really appreciate your help.

How did Jason do in dealing with Susan’s defensiveness? Overall, he did a good job. Jason was empathetic, he picked up on Susan’s nonverbal behavior, he had her offer her input, he held the meeting in a comfortable, private location, and he emphasized that the meeting was to work on future performance and not to punish her. In the end, he was able to address Susan’s defensiveness and turned a meeting that could have gone very poorly into a productive exchange of information and ideas.
