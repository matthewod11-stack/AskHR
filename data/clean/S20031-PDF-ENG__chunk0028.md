Research shows that harassment training actually makes men more likely to blame the victims and to think that women are overreacting.

a backlash? That seems counterintuitive. The problem is with how the training is presented. Typically it’s mandatory, which sends the message that men have to be forced to pay attention to the issue. And it focuses on forbidden behaviors, the nitty-gritty, which signals that men don’t know where the line is. The mes- sage is that men need fixing.

Start any training by telling a group

of people that they’re the problem, and they’ll get defensive. Once that happens, they’re much less likely to want to be a part of the solution; instead they’ll resist. That’s what happens with harassment training: Research shows that it actually makes men more likely to blame the victims and to think that women who report harassment are making it up or overreacting. No surprise, then, that in a 2018 study carried out by the Pew Research Center, more than 30% of men said that false claims of sexual harassment are “a major problem.” And no surprise that 58% of women who had been harassed said that not being believed is a major problem.

This dynamic plays out in predictable

ways—one of which is that men, put on the defensive, make jokes about the training scenarios and about harassment itself. The phenomenon is so common that the writers of The Office devoted an entire episode to it. At one point Pam, the receptionist, wearily tells the camera, “Usually, the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day everyone harasses me as a joke.”

What about men who are prone to harass? The reason we make training mandatory is to reach those men. Does training help them, at least? No.

Research shows that men who are inclined to harass women before training actually become more accepting of such behavior after training.

Even so, what do companies usually

do when they find men culpable in a grievance process? Sentence them to more training. Six states, including California and New York, now require all employers to provide harassment training to all workers.
