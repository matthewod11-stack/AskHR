movement of the vehicle's front wheels, and cockpit controls are still positioned near

in front of the person sitting in the driver's seat. Significant changes, however, have

been made to the processes involved in both vehicle design and vehicle production.

What had once been the labor of a single great engineer over many years is now

accomplished by a deeply intertwined cooperative network of specialists from several

fields. All must be coordinated and synchronized on high level. With many of the new

materials and technologies which have been introduced in production, the process of

vehicle development has become much more complex than ever before. Surprisingly,

for many efficient car manufacturers in the world, it is to a very high degree, an ad-

hoc process. In 1908, the average cycle time of the Ford Model T was 514 minutes.

In 1913, Henry Ford introduced a moving assembly line and achieved an average

cycle time of 2,3 minutes. Today it is reduced to 60 seconds. After all, the development

of automobiles depends on humans. The fact that automotive development is so

difficult but also so fascinating is related to the reasons that it requires not only the

technical integration of individual parts in order to construct an entire vehicle, but also

the coordination of the efforts of thousands of individuals who come from a variety of

companies and who come from a variety of different cultural, social, and professional
