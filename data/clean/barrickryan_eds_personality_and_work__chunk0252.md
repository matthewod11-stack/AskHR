# Conclusion

The model shown in Figure 3.1 is our interpretation of how spe- ciÔ¨Åc distal personality traits, as well as situational factors, are re- lated to important work behaviors on a day-to-day basis. This model emphasizes personal goals (strivings and projects) as the key prox- imal motivational variables through which our long-term disposi- tional tendencies are operationalized. Alternative theoretically relevant measures of motivation include expectancies and com- petency beliefs, affective variables, and subjective values and va- lences. We believe that focusing on cognitive-motivational goals captures much of the critical variance for the work motivation con- struct space relevant to these performance outcomes. Certainly, there is considerable support for the notion that cognitive pro- cesses (goals) are critical to understanding the relationship be- tween person factors and job behaviors. Nevertheless, future research must address whether these goal-oriented variables ade- quately represent motivational effects.

Our model suggests that Accomplishment Striving is the en- gine through which the relevant social goals (either Status Striving or Communion Striving, depending on the situation) affect per- formance. The available data support this conjecture, but we still need direct comparisons of the effects of Accomplishment Striv- ings on either Status Striving and Communion Striving and, in turn, their effects on performance in a variety of work settings. This model also suggests that the explanation for the universal effects for Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are due to their ef- fects on Accomplishment Striving.
