# HBR / Digital Article / Our Favorite Management Tips on Communicating Like a Leader

- When expressing an opinion, use “I” statements. Avoid making

accusations or casting blame, which will put your employee on the

defensive. Instead of calling them out and pointing ﬁngers, call them

in by expressing your experience of their behavior.

- Turn a hard “no” into a soft “no.” As a direct person, your instinct

may be to unambiguously reject an inessential work request that

comes in when you just don’t have the bandwidth to take it on. But

if you’re too blunt, you risk being perceived as someone who doesn’t

want to collaborate or help out. Instead, ﬁnd the compassion to oﬀer

an alternative that works better for you and your schedule, or kindly

explain why it’s impossible for you to take on.

- When making a request, be considerate, not commanding. There’s

nothing wrong with giving clear, direct instructions and assignments.

Just remember to be reasonable, express gratitude, and oﬀer support if

your employee needs it.
