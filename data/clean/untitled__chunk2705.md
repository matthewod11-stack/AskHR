were offered and committees were formed. On September 2, 1968, the group adopted the name, The Association of Black Psychologists and selected Charles Thomas as chair and Robert Green as co-chair. Realizing the APA executive board was in session at that same moment, Thomas led a group to the meeting and the newly created Association of Black Psychologists presented its ﬁrst case before the APA. The board agreed that Thomas and other representatives of ABPsi should bring their concerns before the APA council meeting in Washington, DC, scheduled for October 5–6, 1968 (B. H. Williams, 1997).

At the October meeting, a resolution expressing apprecia- tion for Thomas’s work was passed and the council formally urged APA to act quickly on the concerns of the ABPsi. As part of this, plans were made for a conference to address re- cruitment of black and other minority students and faculty in psychology (McKeachie, 1969). Held on April 18–20, 1969, the conference addressed issues of training and the other con- cerns raised by ABPsi. The meeting resulted in any number of recommendations (see Albee, 1969). By the summer of 1969, APAwas preparing to gather for the annual convention to be held in Washington, DC. As APA President George Miller was being introduced, members of the newly formed Black Students Psychological Association (BSPA) walked to the stage. More literally than perhaps he anticipated, George Miller was quickly engaged in giving psychology away as he yielded the podium to the student association.

Chair of the BSPA, Gary Simpkins, announced that the BSPA would present a list of demands to the APA Council of Representatives the next day, a task that kept the Council busy all that day. The list was familiar and resonated with the issue brought forth before by theABPsi. Council voiced support for the BSPA’s position and requested a speciﬁc proposal. APA President George Miller and President-Elect George Albee were appointed to meet with the BSPAand theABPsi to work out the details. Declining an invitation to meet in Washington, the BSPA instead selected Watts as the meeting place. Miller and Albee ﬂew to Los Angeles, were hosted by local families and engaged in two days of discussion with the BSPAand the ABPsi (see Albee’s section in this chapter for a detailed accountofthemeeting).ReportingbacktotheAPACouncilon October4,1969,aspeciﬁcplanwaspresented.GarySimpkins and Philip Raphael (1970) of the BSPAoutlined the needs for: (a) improved recruitment of black students and faculty in psychology, (b) a centralized information center that could disseminate information about psychology programs and sources of ﬁnancial aid, (c) ﬁeld training relevant to the needs of black students and the black community, and (d) the expan- sionofavailableblackmentalhealthprofessionalsthroughthe creation of terminal programs at all degree levels.

The ABPsi national chairman, Robert Williams, addressed the Council and in a strongly worded statement decried the misuse of psychological tests in the diagnosis and placement of black children in educational settings. He reiterated the commitment of the ABPsi to serve as a resource and monitor for policies that affected African Americans, and called for sanctions against departments of psychology that discrimi- nated against students of color. ABPsi’s ofﬁcial policy state- ment on the retention and recruitment of black students in graduate psychology was contained in “The Ten Point Pro- gram.” The program, mailed to all accredited doctoral train- ing programs in psychology, contained 10 commitments departments could make to ensure that African American stu- dents were accepted into and supported through doctoral training (for the list see R. L. Williams, 1974). The APA professed sympathy to the causes of the ABPsi and the BSPA moved quickly to endorse the presented proposals and estab- lished the Commission for Accelerating Black Participation in Psychology (CABPP).

In May 1970, a curious blue insert of 31 pages appeared in the American Psychologist. Labeled as special inserts, their purpose was to convey information quickly to members of the association. The ﬁrst special insert was a discussion of the need for a national information system for psychol- ogy; the second a series of reprints from the October Council meeting. Included were the statement of the BSPA, the report of Robert Williams, and an APA response. In that response, the APA noted that it had given ofﬁce space and funds for a national secretariat to address acceleration of black partici- pation in psychology, provided funding for meetings, confer- ences, and organizing activities of the ABPsi and the BSPA, supported the establishment of a speakers bureau, and con- tacted psychology departments and deans to inform them of the APA’s interest in and support of these efforts. A good start, but nonetheless it was only a start. Ted Blau (1970) commenting on the achievement of the CABPP noted,

Amajority of theAPAmembership is neither aware of the impor- tance of the problem nor involved in engineering solutions. Despite the fact that Council has demonstrated its willingness to actquicklyanddirectlyinthematterofthechallengeofchange,it is a preliminary response only. Psychologists’ total response should not be limited to rhetoric, commissions, ad hoc commit- tees, or logistical support from Central Ofﬁce. The small begin- ning that has been made toward recognizing injustice and inhumanity,rectifyingtheseandthustrulypromotinghumanwel- fare, must be continued and made valid by the commitment and involvement of individual members of the association.

The ABPsi’s efforts to increase minority representation in psychology continued unabated into the 1970s, the fruits of
