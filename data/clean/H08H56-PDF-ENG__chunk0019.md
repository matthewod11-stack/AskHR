## HBR / Digital Article / How to Talk to Your Team the Day After the Election

“This is a moment that calls for compassion,” says Smith. Your team

members may be distraught, distracted, and preoccupied, but “you

yourself have to be on the balcony,” during moments like these. This

means keeping a clear head and staying above the emotional fray. You’re

not detached from the situation, but you’re able to hold perspective and

see beyond the immediate turmoil.

Smith suggests leaning on your community outside of work as a way

to process your emotions and navigate your own partisanship, allowing

you to keep these feelings separate from your professional life. Research

shows that, ironically, the more we attempt to reject, resist, or conceal our diﬃcult emotions, the more likely these feelings are to emerge in

unexpected and potentially disruptive ways. “The challenge is not to

avoid your emotions, but to not let them hijack your leadership,” she

says.

Even though the political landscape may feel chaotic and

overwhelming, strive to maintain a sense of steadiness. Argenti

recommends letting your team members know they can come to you

with any concerns related to the work environment, the economy, or the

organization, and that you want to be open and available for those who

need support. “If, say, people are worried about how the new president

will impact your industry, remind them that economic ﬂuctuations

occur under both administrations. Emphasize your organization’s

resilience by saying something like, ‘We’ve faced challenges before, and

we will adapt to whatever changes come our way.’”

“I don’t want to downplay the strong emotions on both sides,” Argenti

adds. “But in the end, life will go on. We’ll get through this.”
