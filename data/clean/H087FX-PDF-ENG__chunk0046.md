- Accommodating limited “uptime.” Some people with long Covid

struggle with uptime: They’re able to stand or sit for a limited number

of hours (or even minutes in some cases) but may be able to work for hours lying down. When it’s possible to oﬀer in-oﬃce supine

workstations or rooms where employees can meditate or nap, that may be an eﬀective accommodation; when it’s not, companies should

consider allowing partial or total remote work.

Skill development and training. Provide training options that

accommodate energy and symptom ﬂuctuations. Lengthy in-person

sessions can be exhausting, but so can ones that require sitting for hours

or progressing at a set pace. Flexible learning will include options for

in-person, video, or text-based work, allowing participants to control

the length and speed of sessions. Do not use “time spent” or “pace”
