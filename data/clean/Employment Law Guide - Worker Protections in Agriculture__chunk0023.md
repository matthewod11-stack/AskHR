Enforcement: The Wage and Hour Division enforces the MSPA. During a MSPA investigation, Wage and Hour investigators may enter and

inspect premises (including vehicles and housing), review and transcribe payroll and other records, and interview employers and employees.

The MSPA provides migrant agricultural workers and day-haul seasonal agricultural workers the right to receive written notice of the terms and

conditions of their employment when recruited. In addition, it provides seasonal workers the right to receive such written notiﬁcation upon the worker's request. The MSPA also requires employers of migrants and seasonal agricultural workers to adhere to the disclosed terms and

conditions of employment. Certain exemptions and exclusions apply to these provisions.

The MSPA gives migrant and seasonal agricultural workers the right to ﬁle a complaint with the Wage and Hour Division, ﬁle a private lawsuit

under the Act (or cause a complaint or lawsuit to be ﬁled), or testify or cooperate with an investigation or lawsuit in other ways without being

intimidated, threatened, restrained, coerced, blacklisted, discharged, or discriminated against in any manner.

Posters. Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association, that is subject to the MSPA and that employs any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker is required to post a poster explaining the rights and protections for workers required under the MSPA,
