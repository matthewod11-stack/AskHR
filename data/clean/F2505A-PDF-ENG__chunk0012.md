## (data visualization software)—components of a popular tech stack—

would be considered more conventional and less innovative than

a ﬁrm combining lesser-known products such as DigitalOcean,

CockroachDB, and Metabase. The researchers say companies using

more-novel technology combinations tend to create more-innovative

and -functional products. Previous research had measured innovation

using metrics such as patent ﬁlings, but because ﬁling a patent is a

cumbersome process and many startups never seek patent protection,

the ways ﬁrms combine technologies is a more relevant measure, the

researchers say, noting that breakthrough products such as the iPhone

came about primarily from combining existing technologies in novel
