# The Psychology of Consciousness

With the exception of comparative psychologists (see follow- ing), the founding generation of scientiﬁc psychologists studied human consciousness via introspection (Leahey, 2000).Theywerethusprimarilyconcernedwiththeprocesses of sensation and perception, which are discussed in another chapter of this handbook. Research and theory continued to be guided by the positions already developed by philoso- phers. Most psychologists, including Wilhelm Wundt, the traditional founder of psychology, adopted one form or another of the Way of Ideas, although it was vehemently re- jected by the gestalt psychologists, who adopted a form of realism proposed by the philosopher Franz Brentano (1838–1917; Leahey, 2000).
