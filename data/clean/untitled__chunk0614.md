## The Psychophysicists and the Correspondence Problem 103

physical stimulus by Gustav Teodore Fechner (1801–1887). Fechner was a physicist and philosopher who set out to solve the mind–body problem of philosophy, but in so doing actu- ally became, if not the ﬁrst experimental psychologist, at least the ﬁrst person to do experimental psychological re- search. Fechner got his degree in medicine at Leipzig and actually studied physiology under Weber. He accepted a po- sition lecturing and doing research in the physics department at Leipzig, where he did research on, among other things, the afterimages produced by looking at the sun through colored ﬁlters. During the process of this, he damaged his eyes and was forced to retire in 1839. For years he wore bandages over his eyes; however, in 1843 he removed them, and reveling in the beauty of recovered sight he began a phenomenological assessment of sensory experience. On the morning of October 22, 1850, Fechner had an insight that the connection between mind and body could be established by demonstrating that there was a systematic quantitative relationship between the perceived stimulus and the physical stimulus. He was willing to accept the fact that an increase in stimulus intensity does not produce a one-to-one increase in the intensity of a sensa- tion. Nonetheless, the increase in perceived sensation magni- tudes should be predictable from a knowledge of the stimulus magnitudes because there should be a regular mathematical relationship between stimulus intensity and the perceived in- tensity of the stimulus. He described the nature of this rela- tion in his classic book The Elements of Psychophysics, which was published in 1860. This book is a strange mixture of philosophy, mathematics, and experimental method, but it still had a major impact on perceptual research.

Fechner’s description of the relationship between stimu- lus and perception began with a quantitative manipulation of Weber’s data. What Weber had found was that the discrimi- nation of weight differences was based on proportional rather than arithmetic difference. For example, suppose an individual can just barely tell the weight difference between 10 and 11 quarters in sealed envelopes; then this minimally perceptible difference between 10 and 11 represents a 1(cid:1)10 in- crease in weight (computed as the change in intensity of 1 quarter divided by the starting intensity of 10 quarters). This fraction, which would be known as the Weber fraction, then predicted the stimulus difference that would be just notice- able for any other starting stimulus. Thus, you would need a 10-quarter difference added to an envelope containing 100 quarters to be discriminated (e.g., 100 versus 110), a 5- quarter difference if the envelope contained 50 quarters, and so forth. Since these minimal weight changes are just barely noticeable, Fechner assumed that they must be subjectively equal. Now Fechner makes the assumption that these just no- ticeable differences can be added, so that the number of
