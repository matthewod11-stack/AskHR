## Part I • Strategic and General Considerations

- Many trade-offs take place in the real- world implementation of performance management systems; however, the closer the system is to the ideal charac- teristics, the greater the return will be for the employees, supervisors, and the organization as a whole.

- A performance management system is the key factor used in determining whether an organization can manage its human resources and talent effectively. Performance management provides information on who should be trained and in what areas, which employees should be rewarded, and what type of skills are lacking at the organization or unit level. Therefore, performance man- agement also provides information on the type of employees that should be hired. When implemented well, performance management systems pro- vide critical information that allows organizations to make sound decisions regarding their people resources.

- Given the globalized and hyper- competitive nature of business in the

twenty-first century, there is a common worldwide challenge to align individ- ual and organizational goals and enhance the performance of individu- als and groups. However, the way these goals are achieved is influenced by both organizational and societal contextual issues. A performance man- agement system in China may not be the same as a performance manage- ment system in Mexico or France. Although the system’s main objectives may be the same, the way the system is implemented and deployed must take contextual considerations into account.

As should be evident by now, imple- menting an ideal performance management system requires a substantial amount of work; however, this does not start when the system is put into place. The process starts much earlier because unless specific conditions are present before the system is implemented, the system will not achieve its multiple purposes. Chapter 2 provides a description of the entire performance management process.
