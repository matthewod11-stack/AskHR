# team norms.

The executive board of a logistics solution company we worked with

found itself in a situation where members were frustrated with one of

their peers, resulting in an us-versus-him dynamic. But we found that

the reality was more complicated. The team was consistently violating

an initially agreed-upon norm of turn-taking and sharing the airtime

in discussions. The ﬂipchart that featured this agreement had been

pushed to the corner of the room and subsequently forgotten. The

simple act of asking them to revisit those norms launched the reset. We

asked them to evaluate themselves: “On a scale of 1–10, how well are you

doing on your initial agreement to take turns and share the airtime?”

. . .

Like any living systems, teams need regular care, attention, and

intentional renewal to thrive. Relaunching a team isn’t a sign of failure

—it’s a sign of leadership. By pausing to reassess, reset, and realign,

leaders can reenergize their teams, strengthen trust, and build the

clarity and momentum needed for sustained performance in an ever-

changing environment.
