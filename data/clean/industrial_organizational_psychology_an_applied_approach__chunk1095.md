## Figure 5.1 Coworkers’ attitudes toward employee

chapter 

). Because we have all worked with terrible employees at some point in our lives, it would at first seem surprising that references typically are so positive. But keep in mind that applicants choose their own references! Even Adolph Hitler, Ted Bundy, and Osama bin Laden would have been able to find three people who could provide them with favorable references.

Figure . shows how coworkers’ attitudes toward an employee affect the references they give that person. In the first situation, all of the applicant’s eight coworkers have positive feelings about the applicant. Thus, if we ask for refer- ences from two coworkers, both would be positive and representative of the other six coworkers. In situation , most coworkers have neutral regard for the applicant, with two having positive feelings and two having negative feelings. In this situation, however, both references chosen by the applicant would be positive and more favorable than most coworkers’ attitudes. In situation , only two of eight people like the applicant—yet the two reference letters will be the same as in the first and second situations, even though most coworkers have negative feelings about our applicant. In situation , no one likes our appli- cant. In this case, our request for references would either keep the person from applying for our job or force the applicant to find references from somewhere
