# 3.4 Tree and Random Forest with Python

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification

tasks, particularly when the target variable is discrete or categorical (i.e., it has distinct classes).

This algorithm is also applicable for regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous,

but here we'll focus on its classification aspect.

Decision trees fall under the category of supervised learning algorithms. In supervised learning,

the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset where both input features (predictors) and

corresponding target labels (categories) are known. Decision trees are well-suited for scenarios

where the outcomet to predict is categorical and has two or more classes. For our instance, it is

classification problem like determining whether an employee will leave or not.

Predictor variables, for classification tree, can be either categorical or numerical. This

flexibility allows decision trees to handle a variety of data types.The decision-making process

in a decision tree is represented as a tree-like structure of if-then rules. Each node in the tree

represents a decision based on a specific feature, and the branches emanating from the node

represent the possible outcomes of that decision. The leaves of the tree correspond to the final
