# HBR / Digital Article / When Asking Too Many Questions Undermines Your Leadership

Try: Introducing a monthly learning session where team members are

encouraged to present on something new they’ve learned, related or unrelated to their current projects. You kick oﬀ the ﬁrst session. For

example, “I’ve recently explored how X can improve our workﬂows,

which might seem daunting at ﬁrst, but here’s how it can be practically

applied…” This method promotes a supportive atmosphere for learning

and sharing, enhancing the team’s cohesion and collaborative spirit.

. . .

A learning mentality is undoubtedly a valuable trait for personal and

professional growth. Yet, as we’ve explored, it can have a dark side.

Every strength, if overused, becomes a liability. By positioning the why

behind your learning, you can shift how people perceive your most

valuable leadership strength. After all, the world belongs not to those

who know the most, but to those who learn the fastest. Embrace a

balanced approach to learning and execution to ensure that your quest

for knowledge enhances your leadership and drives success.
