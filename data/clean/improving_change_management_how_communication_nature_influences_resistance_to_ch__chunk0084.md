# generic marketknow-how.

Interestingly, behavioral dimension of resistance to change according to the

participants of the research, has also fallen down, but not in the same scale compared

to the other dimensions. One possible explanation is the fact that nowadays there is

institutional support to act or express the intention to act in response to the change

(e.g., complaining about the change, trying to convince others that the change is bad),

and so people are encouraged to act. This is expected in regular meetings as a

contribution to shaping the change itself, through the transversality practice.

Another complementary explanation is that as many changes are related to

establishing patterns and so called bureaucratic procedures, and as generic market is

so “nervous” and fast, employees really need to find ways to proceed and overcome

what is perceived sometimes as bureaucracy if they want to keep the speed and

innovation that the strategic relationship positioning adopted by Organization X really

requires. In other words, finding ways to adjust patterns, surmount procedures and

provoke ruptures is what is expected and allowed to do (dialogic communication), but

that takes time, and becomes a matter to this business how get to quicker solutions

without injuring organizational practices of transversality and dialogue.
