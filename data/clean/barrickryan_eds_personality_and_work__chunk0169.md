# THE HAPPY WORKER 45

piness may have different effects on distinct reasons for absen- teeism (see Kohler & Mathieu, 1993, for a discussion of the rea- sons for absenteeism). Happy workers may be less likely to miss work due to illness, but they may be more likely to miss work due to injuries from accidents or simply because they wanted to do something more exciting that day than go to work (Furnham & Miller, 1997). We should note, however, that Dalton and Mesch (1991) found that job satisfaction was related only to absence due to illness and not to absence due to other causes. Again, however, positive affect may function differently from job satisfaction, and thus we recommend that researchers go beyond simply examining outcome variables like absenteeism and try to incorporate addi- tional measures that can explain exactly why happy workers are ab- sent more or less frequently.
