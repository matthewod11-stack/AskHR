# nobody else can.

With that in mind, select a couple of colleagues you can trust to provide

you with honest feedback and ideas for improvement. By doing so,

you’ll demonstrate your commitment to becoming a better leader. You’ll

also make clear to those around you that you care, which ensures that

when you slip up, as you inevitably will, you’ll get help and the beneﬁt

of the doubt. But watch out: When you ask for feedback, be prepared to

follow up on it. We’ve found that the leaders most likely to fail in their

adaptation journeys are those whose colleagues tire of giving feedback

because nothing seems to come of it.

More than ever, we need leaders who can harness ingenuity and foster

engagement. At the top level of organizations, success requires a broad

repertoire of people skills that make it possible to lead others indirectly

on a large scale. For many executives, gaining them will involve a

journey of transformation, one that’s likely to be longer and more diﬃcult than they’d imagined—but ultimately also more rewarding.
