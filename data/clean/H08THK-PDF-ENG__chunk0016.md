# HBR / Digital Article / Our Favorite Management Tips on Communicating Like a Leader

Chunk it up. Your audience can only handle three to four pieces of

information at once. Organizing your key points under one central idea

will help them retain details and connect the dots.

Make it concrete. Abstract ideas are tough to remember. Use vivid,

relatable examples that evoke sensory details to create a mental image

your audience won’t forget.

Provide callbacks. Revisit earlier points to strengthen your audience’s

recall. Subtle reminders of previous content help reinforce memory and

tie new information to existing knowledge.
