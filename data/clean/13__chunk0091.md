## A Multilevel Framework for Work Team Diversity Research

extant theoretical perspectives as well as empirical research that has taken an input-process-output approach to understanding the outcomes of diversity, we focus on speciﬁc aspects of the discrete context that can potentially inﬂuence process and performance outcomes (see also Van Knippenberg & Schippers, 2007). Speciﬁcally, we examine the following aspects of discrete context: team task, team tenure, team dispersion, team leadership, and team climate. Below we consider each of these aspects of context in greater detail. We ﬁrst discuss how each of these aspects of context can shape the outcomes of work group diversity. We then present ﬁndings from the literature review to get an indication of the extent to which these contextual factors have been taken into consideration in team diversity research.
