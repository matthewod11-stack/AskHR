# The Research

We measured or manipulated contact with nature at work in diﬀerent

ways across multiple studies, with workers in the U.S., Canada, China,

New Zealand, and Indonesia. In experiments, working adults were simply shown images of workplaces suﬀused with natural elements

or matching images without nature. We then asked them to imagine

they worked in these spaces and report how it would make them feel

and perform. We also conducted more complex studies in real-world

work settings. For instance, we assessed employees’ actual contact

with nature during a week at work (e.g., working near plants, natural

views, or the sound of running water), and then measured their feelings

and objective job performance. Finally, in a ﬁeld experiment in an

accounting ﬁrm, we went into the oﬃces at night and placed potted

plants at some employees’ desks and similar pots, only ﬁlled with

oﬃce supplies, at other desks. We then measured the attitudes and job

performance of the two groups and compared them.

The results were largely consistent across these studies: Experiencing

even small doses of nature at work improved the way employees felt

in ways that fueled higher task performance, increased helping, and

enhanced creativity. These ﬁndings indicate that incorporating micro-

nature into work settings can contribute to worker well-being and
