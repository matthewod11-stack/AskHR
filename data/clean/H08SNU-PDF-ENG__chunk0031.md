## “stop-doing” reviews alongside traditional goal-setting exercises. In

these reviews, teams examine their workﬂows, tools, and deliverables

and identify what no longer adds value.

Elimination helps cut extraneous steps that contribute little to outcomes, while consolidation removes unnecessary handoﬀs or approval loops. Hiding can be used to remove low-value oﬀerings

or services that confuse customers or dilute strategic focus. By

building these forms of subtraction into annual or quarterly planning,

organizations improve eﬃciency and maintain strategic alignment

without expanding complexity.
