Task leadership. Table 4 presents the different outcomes for each of the different leader- ship structures (i.e., when having zero, one, two, or three task leaders). The MANOVA yielded a significant difference in all outcome variables depending on the number of leaders (Wilk’s Λ = .77, F(27,1495.95) = 5.04, p < .001; partial η2 = .08), with the highest scores being found in teams with three task leaders. Only for role clarity and social cohesion, no significant differ- ences were found between teams with zero, one, two, or three task leaders, although a trend in the expected direction was noted.

To provide more insight about the significant F-value obtained, Bonferroni post-hoc analy-

sis revealed that teams with three task leaders scored significantly better on all the outcome variables (except for role clarity and social cohesion) compared to teams with two task leaders, teams with one task leader, and teams with no task leader. For some variables, also teams with two task leaders showed significantly better values than teams with one task leader (such as relationship conflict, collective efficacy, and perceived performance) or no task leaders (such as relationship conflict and perceived performance). To summarize, the results indicated that shared leadership within the role of task leadership (i.e., ideally having three task leaders) bene- fits team effectiveness the most, which confirms H1a.

Social leadership. Table 5 presents the different outcomes for each of the different leader- ship structures (i.e., when having zero, one, or two social leaders). The results revealed a signif- icant difference between the three leadership structures with respect to role conflict, task conflict, social cohesion, and perceived performance (Wilk’s Λ = .84, F(18,1026.00) = 5.36, p < .001; partial η2 = .09). Bonferroni post-hoc analysis showed that social cohesion in the team was only maximal when having two social leaders compared to having only one leader, thereby only partly supporting H1b. For other outcomes, such as role conflict, task conflict and per- ceived performance, having only one social leader seems to be the most favorable situation. External leadership. Table 6 presents the different outcomes for each of the different leadership structures (i.e., when having zero, one, or two external leaders). Significant differ- ences were found between these different leadership structures with respect to their effect on social cohesion and intention to continue (Wilk’s Λ = .86, F(22,1022.00) = 4.39, p < .001; partial η2 = .07). Specifically, Bonferroni post-hoc analysis revealed that teams with two external lead- ers obtained better values on social cohesion and intention to continue than teams having only one external leader. These findings confirm H1c in that having shared leadership within the external leadership role is the most favorable situation.
