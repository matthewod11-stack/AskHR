Another approach to game-theoretic equilibrium maintains the assumption of equilibrium beliefs, but

substitutes stochastic choice for best-response, creating “quantal response equilibrium” (QRE) models

(McKelvey and Palfrey, 1998). Weakening best-response explains many of the experimental deviations from

Nash equilibrium, but also approximates Nash play in games where the Nash equilibrium tends to be accurate
