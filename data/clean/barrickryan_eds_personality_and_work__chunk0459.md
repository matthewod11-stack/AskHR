# 134 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Whereas primary appraisal determines the valence and inten- sity of the emotion experienced, secondary appraisal determines the particular discrete emotion experienced. Although different theorists propose different appraisal dimensions, all of them agree that the event is evaluated in relation to several attributes (such as causal attribution, coping potential, and stability of the event), and the pattern of attributions results in the elicitation of the particular emotion. (See Smith and Ellsworth, 1985, or Lazarus, 1991, for a more thorough discussion of this process.)

Although we have emphasized the discrete, transient nature of emotional states, Frijda (1993) has discussed the concept of “emo- tion episode,” that is, emotional reactions extended over time. In these emotion episodes, people experience a dynamic ﬂow of emo- tional reactions over an extended time. Sometimes these discrete emotions are different emotions, but all cohere around a single underlying theme (a company layoff, for example). The emotion episode is characterized by a heightened arousal and attention with the same underlying theme as the instigating event. During this time, people are trying to deal with the emotions, and their be- haviors are controlled by the emotion. To understand the affective process fully, we must recognize the characteristics of these emo- tional episodes. For example, it is the peak and end of the emotional experience that appear to be remembered when looking back on an event (Fredrickson, 2000).

Emotion processes do not stop with emotion elicitation. Moods and discrete emotions have behavioral consequences that are of great relevance to organizational functioning. Mood states bias judgments and decisions. They inﬂuence helping behaviors. They change the nature of cognitive processing (Weiss, 2002a). Discrete emotions are accompanied by particular behavioral tendencies and also have processing implications (Tagney, 1999). In addition, emo- tion and mood regulation processes accompany affective states as people try to manage their emotions, sustaining positive experi- ences and coping with negative ones. These regulatory processes generally put demands on cognitive resources. They inﬂuence at- tentional processes that have an impact on task performance and involve particular and individualized strategies.

To simplify the explanation (perhaps overly so), the affect process starts with the appraisal of emotion-relevant events and
