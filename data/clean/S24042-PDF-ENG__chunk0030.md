New CEOs who come from outside the company face a diﬀerent

conundrum. They’re still strangers to the organization, and all eyes

are on their every step as stakeholders try to decipher their point of

and make bold statements. However, the bigger risk is in being forced

into premature opinions that may limit your options down the road

and potentially even corner you. This CEO realized that the insecurity

of being new in the job made him prone to weigh in too quickly and

show oﬀ his smarts. To counter those tendencies, we worked with him

to develop a clear executive agenda while learning the fundamental

parameters of the business that would help him align all stakeholders
