# Commit to your PTO.

One of the biggest challenges during year-end tasks is managing time

oﬀ, especially when urgent requests pop up. According to a 2023 Pew

research study, many Americans hesitate to take all their paid time oﬀ

due to concerns about falling behind at work.

To avoid giving up your well-deserved vacation days (and your overall

well-being), conﬁdently communicate your plans with your colleagues.
