Given their long history and putative ben- efits, union grievance procedures have been sub- jected to a large amount and variety of theoretical and empirical research. What can be learned from this research in terms of key issues for and salient recommendations to senior human re- source and labor relations executives? To address this question, we critically review psychological, sociological, economics, and industrial relations research on grievance procedures and synthe- size the main findings from each research area. Table I presents a summary of this research. We then offer recommendations to senior human resource and labor relations executives for deal- ing with key grievance issues that emerge from this research synthesis.2
