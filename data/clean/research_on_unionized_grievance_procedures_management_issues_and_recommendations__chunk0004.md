# Introduction1

It is a virtual truism that conflict is inherent in the employment relationship. Though usu- ally implicit or covert, such conflict becomes explicit or overt when an employment rela- tionship features unionized employees and management. Here, the parties seek to re- solve conflict through a process of collective negotiations. From one perspective negotia- tions occur periodically, every three years or so in the typical labor-management relation- ship. From another perspective, however, la- are bor-management continuous, with the grievance procedure commonly found in labor agreements serv- ing as the main mechanism through which such negotiations operate. Many scholars and practitioners consider conflict resolution through grievance procedures to be the ma- jor accomplishment of the United States sys- tem of industrial relations (for example, Peterson, 1992).
