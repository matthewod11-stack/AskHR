During my many years as a professor of leadership, I’ve been asked

one question more times than I can count: Can leadership actually

be taught? I usually respond with a well-rehearsed answer: Much

like athletic prowess or musical talent, people’s innate capacity for

leadership varies. But just as good coaches and teachers can help

athletes and musicians realize their full potential, good educators can

help people become better leaders. To do that at Harvard Business

School, we draw heavily on John Kotter’s framework, which breaks a

leader’s job down into three key functions: articulating a compelling

vision, aligning people around it, and motivating them to execute it.
