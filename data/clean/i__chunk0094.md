## engineers and later psychology researchers.

The earliest adoption of data in human resources, as scripted by Isson (2016), was in 1911,

when a mechanical engineer made an experiment to measure workers' productivity and the

industry’s efficiency. In his work, he suggests best practices and guidelines for efficiency.

In 1923 Hugo MÜnsterberg, and in 1945 Elton Mayo employed metrics and measured the

impact of each component on work performance and morale by adjusting and monitoring each

variable. His metrics included working hours, rest breaks, lighting, humidity, and temperature.

Heuvel and Bondarouk (2017) have summarized the evolution of PA analytics from the first

hit of digitalization development to the HR department since 1980 for HR automation and

adoption of HR information systems. In this phase, there were many studies on the maturity

model of HR, the development of the HR framework for automation, and the prerequisite for

adoption. However, the system is predominantly used for payroll and other administrative

purposes. In the 1990s, Organizations began to realize the prospects of utilizing computer

systems in Human resource management. HR department cautiously increased their use of

information systems even though there was research done by academics and practitioners on

other potential applications of IS that could be done in everyday HR practice.

During the 2000s, the Human Resources (HR) field witnessed an expansion in technology

utilization. This era saw the emergence of the term "e-HRM," which refers to electronic Human

Resource Management. During this time, HR departments began harnessing technology for

strategic planning and implementation. This adoption encompassed a range of functions,

including administrative tasks in 62% of companies, employee recruitment in 52%,
