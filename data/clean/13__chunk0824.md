target of both subtle humor (e.g., ironic comments), and direct humor (e.g., jocular abuse).

Summary of Motivations to Use Humor A number of themes underlying positive and negative motivations to use humor in organizational contexts have been described in the humor literature. We summarized these themes under two broad categories, positive motivations (i.e., to develop cohesiveness, to mask negative message content, reduce stress or anxiety, and to ingratiate oneself with others), and negative motivations (i.e., the need to control and dominate others, the need to subvert authority and status). While we do not imply that this list of motivations to use humor in organizational contexts is necessarily comprehensive, we suggest that it represents a reasonable reﬂection of the current literature on humor that is relevant to organizations, and provides a good starting point for understanding the perspective of humor producers. And ﬁnally, we reiterate that the term ‘negative humor’ is potentially misleading, because it usually refers to the fact that humor is frequently used to help communicate negative messages, where the humor itself is not inherently negative.
