# Enforcement Through Investigation

WHD enforcement of the FLSA is carried out by investigators stationed across the country. As WHD authorized representatives, they conduct investigations and gather data on wages, hours, and other employment conditions in order to determine compliance with

the law regardless of workers’ immigration status. Where violations are found, they will recommend changes in employment practices in employment practices to bring an employer into compliance.

The FLSA allows the Department of Labor (“Department”) or an employee to recover back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages where minimum wage and overtime violations exist. Generally, a 2-year statute of limitations applies to the recovery of

back wages and liquidated damages. A 3-year statute of limitations applies in cases involving willful violations.

Remedies may be recovered through administrative procedures, litigation, and/or criminal prosecution.

The Department is authorized to supervise the payment of unpaid minimum wages and/ or unpaid overtime compensation

owed to any employee(s).

Civil money penalties may be assessed for child labor violations and for repeat and/or willful violations of FLSA minimum

wage or overtime requirements.
