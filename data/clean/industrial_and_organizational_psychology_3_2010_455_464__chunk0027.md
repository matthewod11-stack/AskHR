Areas Where JDM Has Already Enriched, or Has the Potential to Enrich, IOOB

In our focal article, we discussed sev- eral substantive and methodological areas where JDM can inform IOOB or had already done so. As evidenced by the paragraphs below, several commentaries expanded on these areas and provided additional examples. We believe the examples identi- ﬁed in the commentaries are an indication of the high quality of work that is likely to be the outcome of increased collaboration between these two areas.

First, D. K. Dalal (no relation to R. S. Dalal, an author on the focal article and this response) and his colleagues (Dalal, Diab, Balzer, & Doherty, 2010) identiﬁed several ways in which the lens model and the research designs with which it is associated the (e.g., policy capturing) can beneﬁt practice of IOOB. The applied focus of this commentary reminds the reader that IOOB practitioners, too, would beneﬁt from Importantly, cross-fertilization with JDM. the emphasis on sampling situations and stimuli in the Brunswikian tradition of judgment research (within which the lens model is based) is likely to be particularly attractive to IOOB.

Second, Bottom andKong (2010; seealso Goodwin, 2010; Kuhn, 2010) discuss the complexities engendered by the contextual inher- factors (such as interdependence) ent in decision making in organizations. They argue that this complexity reduces the appropriateness of expected utility theory as a benchmark for the study of deci- sions in organizations. We agree with the importance of studying context: Although theories based on the principles of expected utility have been employed proﬁtably in the domains of to IOOB—for interest example, motivation (Naylor, Pritchard, & Ilgen, 1980; Vroom, 1964), attitudes (Ajzen, 1991), and employee selection (Brogden, these theories 1949)—the complexity of has proliferated over time in response to the need to model contextual factors.
