# Part III • Employee Development

but nevertheless responsive to thoughtful design and purposeful change. Companies that have success with these programs tend to be open to learning and willing to experiment. They are led by executives who are direct about the expected benefits as well as the challenges. . . . By laying themselves open to praise and criticism from all directions and inviting others to do the same, they guide their organizations to new capacities for continuous improvement.26

Second, in more specific terms, when systems have the following characteristics,

they are most likely to be successful:27

- Anonymity.

In good systems, feedback is anonymous and confidential. When such is the case, raters are more likely to provide honest information regarding perform- ance, particularly when subordinates are providing information about superiors. • Observation of employee performance. Only those with good knowledge and first- hand experience with the person being rated should participate in the process. There is no point in asking for performance feedback from people who are not able to observe performance.

- Feedback interpretation. Good systems allow the person being rated to discuss the feedback received with a person interested in the employee’s development. In most cases, feedback is discussed with the direct supervisor. In other cases, the discussion can involve a representative of the HR department or a superior to whom the person does not report directly.

- Follow-up. The information gathered has little value if there is no follow-up action. Once feedback is received, it is essential that a developmental plan is created right away.

- Used for developmental purposes only (at least initially). When 360-degree feedback sys- tems are used for administrative purposes such as promotions and compensation, raters are likely to distort the information provided. Make it clear that the purpose of the system is developmental and developmental only. Initially, the information col- lected should not be used for making reward allocations or any other administrative decisions. However, the system may be used for administrative purposes after it has been in place for some time—approximately two years or so.

- Avoidance of survey fatigue. Survey fatigue can be avoided if individuals are not asked to rate too many employees at the same time. For example, data collection can be staggered so that not all surveys are distributed at the same time.

- Emphasis on behaviors. Although systems can include feedback on both behaviors (competencies) and results, it is better to emphasize behaviors. Focusing on behaviors can lead to the identification of concrete actions that the person being rated can take to improve performance.

- Raters go beyond ratings.

In addition to providing scores on the various dimen- sions, raters should provide written descriptive feedback that gives detailed and constructive comments on how to improve performance. It is helpful if this information also includes specific examples that help support the ratings and recommendations provided.

- Raters are trained. As in the case of providing evaluations for administrative pur- poses, raters should be trained. Mainly, this includes skills to discriminate good from poor performance and how to provide feedback in a constructive manner.
