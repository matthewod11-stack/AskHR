## capacity, time use, networks, skill sets, performance, and mindsets that

can help pinpoint where change is possible and can measure what

happens when you try it.

One people analytics team at a financial services company was trying to

help the CEO manage growth while he worked to instill a new culture in

which departments would be asked to run leaner and more competitive

in the market – “scrappy” and “hungry” were terms that often came

up. As the transformation accelerated, teams were asked to do more

with less, generate more data, and make decisions faster. Amid this,

department leaders began to hear anecdotes about burnout and change

fatigue and questioned whether the pace was sustainable. To address

this, the people analytics team provided their CEO with a dashboard

showing the number of hours that knowledge workers were active for in

different teams. When an entire team is over-utilized, he knows they

can’t handle more change, while under- or unevenly utilized teams

might be more receptive. He can also slice the dashboard by tenure,

to learn whether recent hires have been effectively onboarded before

approving new hire requests to absorb extra work.
