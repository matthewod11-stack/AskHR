# less?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

The general surveys show a lot of dissatisfaction. That comes and goes,

there’s periods of that and there’s sectors. It’s important to think that a

job is not monolithic. I love my job, it ticks all my boxes too, but there’s

parts of my job I really don’t like, that feel like grunt work. There’s parts

I love, and every job is like that. It is a matter of proportion. It’s by and

large, are you mostly doing the things that you ﬁnd fulﬁlling?

There are lots of people out there who are not satisﬁed. They may have

been, but over time, either they have changed or their organization

has changed, or the people with whom they work have changed, and

they’re no longer happy about those elements. They don’t feel as

challenged. They don’t like and respect the people they work with. They

don’t align with the organization’s mission. All of those things create a

dissatisfaction. And my sense, from talking to my students, from doing

my research, is that there’s a lot of people who are dissatisﬁed out there
