# Sports as a socializing element

For Mestre (2002), physical activity and sports have different social connotations, i.e., team sports improve cooperation and honesty, and individual sports improve responsibility and autonomy.

According to the High Sport College of Spain (García-Ferrando & Llopis, 2010), adult persons practice sports for various reasons: 37.5% as a daily escape; 23.4% for enjoyment; and 14.3% for competition. 24.8% practice a physical activity to improve their health and their social relations (Table 1).

Percent 23.4 % 4.8 % 37.5 % 14.3 % 20.0 %

Definitely, sports require not only good trainers, as in the past, but also new elements

and techniques included in the concept of management (Mestre, 2013).
