# Table 5 Correlation between Q19 and Q20

Effect size indicates whether a relationship is meaningful in a practical sense,

regardless of the amount of data. In this case represent 0.537 which is large effect.

R-squared is a measure of how well a value for one variable could be predicted by

entering a value for the other in the below formula:

Q19: “I can manage my job responsibilities in a way that enable a healthy work-life

balance” = (0.609 x Q20: “I have the flexibility I need in my work schedule to meet

both work and personal needs”) + 0.858 which shows strong statistical relationship
