# Managers’ Emotions are Sharp and Mixed

In any misconduct situation, emotions are likely ﬂaring — for the

manager, the employee, those aﬀected, and observing employees.

For managers, we found that being lenient with employees for their

misconduct makes them feel a mix of both positive and negative

emotions. On the one hand, leniency makes managers feel pride for

helping the employee — and this prideful experience fuels managers’

energy at work. On the other hand, leniency makes managers feel guilt

for breaking from organizational rules and potentially not addressing

the harm, and this experience of guilt drains managers’ energy at work.

Our ﬁndings suggest that being lenient is an emotionally conﬂicting

experience for managers, with leniency evoking both positive (pride)

and negative (guilt) emotions, whether the misconduct was isolated and

did not directly harm another person, whether it only indirectly harmed

others, or whether it directly harmed others.

Yet, the experience becomes more positive if managers have personally

forgiven the oﬀender, meaning they chose to release negative

feelings about the incident and move past it. Perhaps an employee

purposefully misrepresented information during a client presentation,

and the manager followed up and talked through the situation

with the employee, informing them of the negative consequences

of misinformation. If the manager lets go of the negative emotions

associated with the situation and forgives the oﬀender — if, say, the

misrepresentation had a smaller impact on the project than expected

— the manager tends to not feel guilt, but instead is fueled with pride,
