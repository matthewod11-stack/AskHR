for example, shown that organizations that choose to focus on an HR engagement strategy might potentially consider selecting for extraversion, conscientiousness and emotional stability. With respect to socialization we have argued that organizations should provide newcomers with resources that willsatisfy their needs for meaningfulness, safety and efficacy in order to capitalize on the energy and enthusiasm they initially bring to their role. This approach represents a departure from traditional approaches to socialization that provide newcomers with information to aid their learning and reduce uncertainty, rather than facilitate their engagement. With respect to performance management we have argued that high levels of performance may best be achieved by facilitating the conditions that foster and support engagement. We recommend that performance management processes should focus on three primary elements: a performance agreement, engagement facilitation, and performance and engagement appraisal and feedback. We have described the required steps in each of the elements. With respect to training and development, beyond providing employees with appropriate job resources, we recommend training programs to help employees optimize their personal resources, job crafting interventions, and interventions that enable employees to willingly voice ideas, suggestions and concerns to bring about improvement and change.

Conclusion In this paper, we aimed to provide a comprehensive account of how employee engagement needs to be integrated within the HRM fabric of an organization if engagement is to yield sustainable competitive advantage. We have argued that engagement provides a conceptually well-developed and well-researched strategy by which competitiveadvantage can be achieved, developed and maintained. In line with Bowen and Ostroff (2004) who argued that “HRM content and process must be integrated effectively in order for prescriptive models of strategic HRM actually to link to firm performance” (p. 206) we have emphasized that engagement needs to be integrated as a focus across all facets of the employer-employee relationship and across the employee lifecycle. To that end we have argued that engagement needs to be strategically embedded and supported across selection, socialization, performance management and training and development practices, processes and systems.

We proposed a model (Figure 1) that we hope goes some considerable way towards addressing what Becker and Huselid (2006) some years ago described as “the most pressing theoretical challenge facing SHRM” (p. 899). That is, we identified a number of mediating mechanisms to help explain the “black box” of how an organization’s HRM architecture influences its performance outcomes. Beyond integrating HR and engagement literatures that up until now have largely run in parallel, we have gone some way towards reconciling unresolved issues in the engagement literature (see Bakker et al., 2011). For example, the modelling in Figure 1 helps reconcile the JD-R and Kahn’s (1990) approach to engagement by showing that job resources, in part, lead to Kahn’s (1990) psychological conditions, that both lead to engagement. This modelling is also consistent with research conducted by May et al. (2004).

Systematic research programs and rigorous evaluation processes are now needed to test the relationships modelled in Figure 1. Although the proposed model is complex, and therefore difficult to test as a whole, structural equation modelling could be used to test more focused relationships embedded within the model. For example, additional research could usefully determine the direct and indirect effects of the four HR practices on organizational climate and employee engagement. Additional research could also be
