# The Philosophical Period 117

Kant upended the empiricist assumption that the mind conforms itself to objects, declaring that objects conform themselves to the mind, which imposes a universal, logically necessary structure upon experience. Things in themselves— noumena—are unknowable, but things as they appear in con- sciousness—phenomena—are organized by mind in such a way that we can make absolutely true statements about them. Take, for example, the problem addressed by Berkeley, the perception of depth. Things in themselves may or may not be arranged in Euclidean three-dimensional space; indeed, mod- ern physics says that space is non-Euclidean. However, the human mind imposes Euclidean three-dimensional space on its experience of the world, so we can say truly that phe- nomena are necessarily arrayed in three-dimensional space. Similarly, the mind imposes other Categories of experience on noumena to construct the phenomenal world of human experience.

Ascience ﬁction example may clarify Kant’s point. Imag- ine the citizens of Oz, the Emerald City, in whose eyes are implanted at birth contact lenses making everything a shade of green. Ozzites will make the natural assumption that things seem green because things are green. However, Ozzites’ phenomena are green because of the contact lenses, not because things in themselves are green. Nevertheless, the Ozzites can assert as an absolute and irrefutable truth, “Every phenomenon is green.” Kant argued that the Categories of experience are logically necessary preconditions of any ex- perience whatsoever by all sentient beings. Therefore, since science is about the world of phenomena, we can have gen- uine,irrefutable,absoluteknowledgeofthatworldandshould give up inquiries into Locke’s “things themselves.”

Kantian idealism produced a radically expansive view of the self. Instead of concluding with Hume that it is a construction out of bits and pieces of experience, Kant said that it exists prior to experience and imposes order on experi- ence. Kant distinguished between the Empirical Ego—the ﬂeeting contents of consciousness—and the Transcendental Ego. The Transcendental Ego is the same in all minds and imposes the Categories of understanding on experience. The self is not a construction out of experience; it is the active constructor of experience. In empiricism the self vanished; in idealism it became the only reality.
