## Psychological Biases Can Cause Miscalculations

Several psychological biases point to the mistakes we make when

assessing others’ subjective experiences. For one, we tend to gauge

people’s internal states from their observable behaviors, even though

the two are not always aligned. This means that when we observe

someone’s behavioral agreement, as we do when we see them sign a

document, we assume a corresponding psychological agreement.

We also tend to anchor too much on our own knowledge and experience

when assessing what others know and feel. If we understand and agree

with the terms of an agreement, we tend to assume others do too.

Taken together, these biases can lead solicitors of consent to

systematically overestimate how informed the consenting individuals

feel about the terms of an agreement. As a result, solicitors may fail

to anticipate consenters’ eventual dissatisfaction with the agreement,

believing they surely must have “known what they were getting into”

when they consented.

We examined this possibility in a series of studies in which participants

reacted to scenarios involving consent in the workplace, negotiated

agreements in real time, and reﬂected upon the extent to which they

felt they truly understood and consented to the terms of their own
