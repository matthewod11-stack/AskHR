# Transactional Leadership

Transactional leadership is based on an economic exchange process in which the leader provides rewards in return for the subordinateâ€™s effort and performance. The dimensions of transactional leadership model include contingent reward (followers and leaders have a positively reinforcing interaction) and management-by-exception (the leader intervenes only when things go wrong).
