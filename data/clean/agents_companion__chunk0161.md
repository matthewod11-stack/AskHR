# Agentic RAG and its Importance

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced approach that combines the

strengths of RAG with the autonomy of AI agents. Traditional RAG systems retrieve relevant

information from external knowledge sources to enhance LLM responses. Agentic RAG

takes this a step further by employing intelligent agents to orchestrate the retrieval process,

evaluate the retrieved information, and make decisions about how to best utilize it.

Agentic RAG offers several advantages over traditional RAG:

Improved Accuracy: Agents can evaluate the quality of retrieved information and make

decisions about which sources to trust, leading to more accurate and reliable responses.

- Enhanced Contextual Understanding: Agents can consider the context of the user's

query and the retrieved information to generate more relevant and meaningful responses.

Increased Adaptability: Agents can adapt to changing information needs and

dynamically adjust their retrieval strategies to provide the most up-to-date and relevant

information. This adaptability is crucial in complex domains where information is constantly

evolving, such as healthcare, finance, and legal research.
