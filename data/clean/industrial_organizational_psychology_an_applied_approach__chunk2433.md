## Do Employees Enjoy Working with Supervisors and Coworkers?

Research indicates that people who enjoy working with their supervisors and coworkers will be more satisfied with their jobs (Mossholder, Settoon, & Hena- gan, ; Repetti & Cosmas, ). Such findings certainly make sense. We all have had coworkers and supervisors who made our jobs unbearable, and we all have had coworkers and supervisors who made our jobs fun to have. In a study of  employees at an apparel manufacturing plant, Bishop and Scott () found that satisfaction with supervisors and coworkers was related to organi- zational and team commitment, which in turn resulted in higher productivity, lower intent to leave the organization, and a greater willingness to help.
