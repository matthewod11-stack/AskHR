# Without Giving Up or Giving In.

While avoiding conﬂict might feel easier in the moment, that comfort

comes at a cost, says Salinas. “Ask yourself, ‘What are the consequences

of staying quiet?’ Reframing it this way can make speaking up more

compelling and help you push past the hesitation.” The key, adds

capacity to shape outcomes is at the core of negotiation, inﬂuence, and

disagreement,” he says. “These skills rely on the understanding that you

can inﬂuence others—even a powerful boss.” Here’s where to start.

says. “Feedback, tough conversations, and disagreements usually roll

downhill; they’re not something we’re taught to give upwardly.”
