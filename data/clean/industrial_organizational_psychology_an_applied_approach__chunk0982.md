# Effective Employee Selection Techniques

If the recruitment process was successful, an organization will have several appli- cants from which to choose. At this point, many techniques can be used to select the best person from this pool of applicants. In the remainder of this chapter, we will discuss the employment interview. In Chapter , such methods as reference checks, assessment centers, biodata, psychological tests, and physical ability tests will be discussed.

Effective employee selection systems share three characteristics: They are valid, reduce the chance of a legal challenge, and are cost-effective. A valid selection test is one that is based on a job analysis (content validity), predicts work-related behavior (criterion validity), and measures the construct it purports to measure (construct validity). As you will recall from Chapters  and , selection tests will reduce the chance of a legal challenge if their content appears to be job related (face validity), the questions don’t invade an applicant’s privacy, and adverse impact is minimized. Ideal selection tests are also cost-effective in terms of the costs to purchase or create, to administer, and to score. With these characteristics in mind, let’s begin our discussion of selection techniques with the employment interview.
