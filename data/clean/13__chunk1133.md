# Arbitration-Mediation

A second hybrid procedure, arbitration-mediation (hereafter called ‘‘arb-med’’), consists of three phases. In phase one, the third party holds an arbitration hearing. At the end of this phase, the third party makes a decision, which is placed in a sealed envelope and is not revealed to the parties. The second phase consists of mediation. Only if mediation fails to produce a voluntary agreement by a speciﬁed deadline do the parties enter the third phase, called the ruling phase. Here, the third party removes the ruling from the envelope and reveals the binding ruling to the disputants (Cobbledick, 1992; Robertson, 1991). To assure that the envelope contains the original ruling and not a later ruling (e.g., a ruling created after the mediation phase), the third party may ask each side to sign the envelope across the seal at the beginning of mediation. The beneﬁts of arb-med are around time and the maintenance of relationships. Arb-med is efﬁcient with a rapid, binding arbitration phase at the beginning, and then sets a deadline for how long the mediation phase can last. Therefore, parties are not motivated to delay and posture, as any time they waste means that the arbitrator’s decision will be used rather than their own. As well, it reduces the risk of soured relations that can sometimes happen in med-arb if the initial mediation phase becomes contentious and fails (Zack, 2003).

The arb-med procedure has been used in particularly difﬁcult union– management disputes in the automotive and steel industries (in South Africa) and police and ﬁreﬁghter disputes (in the US), and is suggested as a possible solution to airline contract disputes in the US, where avoiding soured from lengthy mediation processes is critical relations that can result (Zack, 2003). A recent empirical study supports these examples, ﬁnding that arb-med was effective in resolving some of the most difﬁcult disputes and led to more settlements in the mediation phase than did med-arb (Conlon, Moon, & Ng, 2002). Thus, if a critical goal is to create conditions that lead disputants to resolve their own disputes, arb-med may be an interesting advance, and may even be well suited to handling particularly difﬁcult disputes.
