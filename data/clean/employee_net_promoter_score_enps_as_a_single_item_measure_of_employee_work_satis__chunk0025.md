Before answering the question if the eNPS may be used to measure job satisfaction, it is good to clarify the latter.

So, what exactly is job satisfaction? On an everyday basis, satisfaction would be connected with a positive, pleasant feeling, often the word satisfaction is con- nected with fulfillment. There is an important component of emotions when we speak about work satisfaction. Lock briefly described it as “pleasurable or posi- tive emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one’s job or job experiences”25. Having satisfaction defined as an emotional state, it has to be remembered that it is only part of the whole story. Satisfaction is in fact an attitudinal construct re- flecting one’s evaluation of his or her job26. The same opinion is presented by Stam- ple and Higgins, who treats satisfaction as a positive attitude towards work and duties27. The term attitude encompasses affect, behavior, and cognition28 which confirms that satisfaction is rather a multidimensional construct.
