Managers must give employees the space to experiment and fail. I suggest

A/B testing productivity before and after implementing AI. Using control

and variation groups, managers should also run rigorous tests and validate

how employees have budgeted the time windfall. That will help managers

develop guidelines and techniques for how employees use the extra time.

Finally, managers should constantly collect data to track it all.
