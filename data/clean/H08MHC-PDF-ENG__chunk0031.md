# HBR / Digital Article / Design Your Transformation for Simplicity — Not Efficiency

occurs when workﬂows are being designed and can have a meaningful,

even determinative, impact on the ﬁnal output. Feedback, on the other

hand, is received after transformation leaders have put in signiﬁcant eﬀort and believe the workﬂow design to be done or nearly so. That

makes them understandably averse to acting on any feedback, short of

a terminal defect, that requires them to substantially redo their work or

that means their work is farther from completion than they believed.

Anyone who has ever been someone else’s employee has at some point been invited to oﬀer feedback on a misguided initiative only for the ﬁnal

output to be nearly identical to the draft.

Seeking feedback — rather than input — is a fatal ﬂaw in workﬂow

design because simplicity is always relative. It’s not enough that

transformation leaders believe they’ve designed a simple workﬂow

because they’re not the ones who will be carrying it out. This is why

user experience and input are at the very center of designed simplicity.

All reasonable scenarios are planned for.

In the race to design minimum viable workﬂows as part of the eﬃciency

approach, the result tends to be one-size-ﬁts-all outputs that address only the ideal and most common scenarios staﬀ will ﬁnd themselves in.

Even in ideal, common scenarios, transformations add complexity.

Returning to the sustainability example, an ideal scenario — the

supplier has the requested sustainability metrics and is pleased to hand

them over — still adds additional steps, activities, and considerations

that complicate the workﬂow.

The more realistic scenario is a less-than-ideal one — perhaps some

suppliers don’t have or are unwilling to share metrics. This not only

adds more disruptive complexity to the process (e.g., negotiations), it

creates new subprocesses with their own workﬂows (e.g., the waiver
