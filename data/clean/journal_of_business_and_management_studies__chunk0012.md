# 4.1 Random Forest

Random Forest is a form of ensemble classifier that incorporates multiple algorithms to categorize items by making a collective decision. For example, it can consolidate algorithms such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes. After consolidating these systems, it makes the final votes from each of the algorithms to develop the model’s classification. In the Random Forest classifier, a category of decision trees is initially established utilizing a sub-category of the training data (Hasan et al. 2024). Afterward, the votes from the different trees are combined to make the ultimate result of the algorithm’s class. The performance of the Random forest is demonstrated in Figure 1 below, portraying the evaluation of its effectiveness.
