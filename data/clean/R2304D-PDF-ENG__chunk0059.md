One of the most highly respected union training programs is UNITE

HERE’s Culinary Academy, also in Las Vegas. The program trains

workers for newly emerging jobs in hospitality, allows them to move

restaurant positions), and serves as a one-stop center for supporting

immigrant workers, teaching English as a second language, and

referring workers at risk of or experiencing layoﬀs to new jobs.
