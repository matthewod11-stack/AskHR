# pitfalls:

Can the vendor clearly demonstrate the logic behind its AI and make its reasoning transparent?

The critical question isn’t whether AI can process information faster

than humans but whether it can reason—i.e., use that information

—in ways that your key domain experts can trust, understand,

and build upon. This question helps avoid the trap of “shallow

transparency illusions,” which happens when vendors show which

criteria were evaluated, for instance, but fail to capture deeper

professional reasoning. Look for solutions that embed professional

judgment frameworks, not just decision trees, and can explain why they

prioritize speciﬁc evidence.

Does the vendor maintain ongoing collaboration with domain experts in your ﬁeld? How does it handle evolving practices?

This requires deep collaboration between AI developers and domain

experts—not just to gather training data but also to understand
