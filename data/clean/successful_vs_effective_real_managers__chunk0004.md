# The Current View of Managerial Work

Through the years management has been defined as the tamous French administrator and writer Henri Fayol said, by the functions of planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. Only recently has this classical view of managers been challenged.2 Starting with the land-

mark work of Henry Mintzberg, observational studies of managerial work have found that the normative functions do not hold up. Mintzberg charged that Fayol and others’ classical view of what managers do was merely ‘folklore 3 On the bass of his observations of five CEOs and their rr atl, Mintzberg concluded that the manager’sjob consisted of many brief and disjointed episodes with people inside and outside the organization. He discounted notions such as

re tlective planning. Instead of the five Fayolian functions of management, Mintzberg portrayed managers tn terms of a typology of roles. He formulated three interpersonal roles (figurehead, leader, and liaison), three informational roles (monitor or nerve center, disseminator, and spokesman),

and four decision-making roles (entrepreneur, disturbance handler, resource allocator, and negotiator). Although Muntzberg based this view of managers on only the five managers he observed and his search of the literature, he did ask, and at least gave the beginning of an answer to, the question of what managers really do

The best known other modern view of managerial work 1s provided by John Kotter His description of managers 15 based on his study of 15 successful general managers Like Mintzberg, Kotter challenged the traditional view by con- cluding that managers do not so simply perform the Fayohan

functions, but rather spend most of their time interacting with others. In particular, he found his general managers spent considerable time in meetings getting and giving information Kotter reters to these get-togethers as “network building” Networking accomplishes what Kotter calls a manager's “agenda” — the loosely connected goals and plans addressing the manager’s responsibilities. By obtaining relevant and needed information from his or her networks, the etfective general manager ts able to implement his or her agenda Like Mintzberg, Kotter’s conclusions are based on managerial work from a small sample of elite managers. Nevertheless, his work represents a progressive step in an- swering the question of what managers do.
