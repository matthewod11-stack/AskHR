## result of uncontrollable strokes of genius, organizations can actually

systematically harness imagination through tactics like seeking out

anomalies (rather than focusing on averages), questioning previously

held assumptions, and conducting experiments.

Foster an environment where human skills can thrive. It may be diﬃcult for intuition and imagination to shine in a

technocratic culture dominated by rational justiﬁcation. To create

an environment that promotes unique human decision-making skills,

organizations must begin with a culture of psychological safety in which

employees can express diverse perspectives, debate ideas openly, and

challenge the status quo.
