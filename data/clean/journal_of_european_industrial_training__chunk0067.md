upward appraisal is a central component in 3608 feedback processes and that rater optimism/pessimism can have a major impact on the effectiveness of the appraisal system, employee attitudes towards and perceptions of upward appraisal are important.

The upward component of the 3608 feedback model represents a significant departure from the traditional top-down performance appraisal that exists in the majority of organisations. Therefore, it is not uncommon that supervisors who are faced with the introduction of such a programme may have reservations about it. Bernardin et al. (1993) cite some of the concerns that are most often raised by managers and supervisors regarding subordinate appraisal. For example, supervisors may focus on pleasing their subordinates in an effort to get higher or more positive appraisals. The manager's authority may also be undermined because of the upward appraisal system and the impact of possible low appraisals on the manager's status within the organisation. Subordinates may lack ability, aptitude, training or necessary job information to provide valid ratings. Some subordinates may be afraid of the consequences if they rate their superiors low or they may tend to rate them higher to score points with them. According to Bernardin et al., employees who are pushed the hardest by their supervisors may rate those supervisors more harshly as a result.

Bernardin et al. (1993) advocate that, contrary to many practitioner-oriented articles which project a very positive image of subordinate appraisal, their experience working with organisations indicates that many supervisors and managers are sceptical of the process and its impact on managerial decision making. They explored the attitudes of first-line supervisors towards sub-ordinate appraisal in a large federal agency in the USA. The respondents were divided into three groups. Group 1 received feedback from both their managers and their subordinates. Group 2 received feedback from their managers only. Group 3 received feedback from their subordinates only. They found that, irrespective of what group the recipients were part of, they were generally supportive of subordinate appraisal but there were some significant differences between the groups. For example, Group 1 (managers and subordinates) disagreed more often than Group 2 (managers only) with the statement that subordinates were insufficiently equipped to rate their superiors. Another difference between the groups was that Group 1 respondents disagreed that

subordinate appraisal undermined supervisor authority, while Group 3 (subordinates only) were largely undecided about the issue.

Smither et al. (1995b) found that employees

were favourable towards upward appraisal. Their study indicates that 95 per cent of managers who received upward appraisal responded that they found the information in the feedback report to be ``moderately or extremely useful''; 89 per cent of respondents found the information helped them target their developmental areas; 90 per cent stated that the feedback process helped them improve their managerial skills to a ``moderate or large extent''. The study findings in general indicate that subordinates found upward appraisal useful and effective as a tool for helping them identify developmental needs.

Smither et al. (1995a) set out to examine the

reactions of employees to normative (the average of the team leaders' ratings) versus individualised upward feedback. They found that managers who receive individualised feedback were more satisfied with the process, perceive the feedback to be more useful and were more likely to discuss the feedback with their teams than managers who received only normative feedback.

Cumulatively, the Bernardin et al. (1993), Smither et al. (1995a and 1995b) studies point to the finding that employees, in general, react favourably towards upward appraisal. Bernardin et al. go on to suggest that upward feedback should be used in conjunction with other sources indicating that multi-source feedback systems would be more beneficial to the career development process than upward feedback alone. Smither et al. (1995a) came to similar conclusions. Not unlike other commentators, they go on to suggest that a 3608 feedback process rather than a system where only the recipient's subordinates rate his/her performance is more appropriate.

Upward appraisal has the potential to offer

invaluable feedback to the focal individual. However, it should be remembered that subordinate appraisal is only appropriate for assessing certain areas of a manager's performance. It is necessary to use upward appraisal in conjunction with as many other rating sources as possible.
