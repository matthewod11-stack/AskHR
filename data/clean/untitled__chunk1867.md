# The Twentieth Century

practitioners attempted to treat psychotic patients on the as- sumptionthatthemajorpsychoticsyndromes—schizophrenia, depression, and manic-depressive psychosis—were the out- comes of severe intrapsychic conﬂicts and might therefore yield to intensive psychoanalytic treatment. Freud had been pessimistic about the possibility of such treatment, not be- cause he thought these disorders primarily organic in nature, but because he judged the patient to have regressed so far to an infantile level of psychic development that the analyst could notmaketheinterpersonalcontactnecessaryforpsycho- analytictreatment.Nonethelessmanyfollowersofpsychoana- lytic doctrine did attempt to apply psychological treatments. These included milieu therapy, group therapy, individual psy- chotherapy, occupational therapy, and recreational therapy (Shapiro,1981).

In this context the fundamental distinction between the “organic” psychoses and the “functional” psychoses arose. Organic psychoses included paresis, Alzheimer’s disease, the toxic psychoses, and other psychotic syndromes asso- ciated with undeniable biological damage. The functional were those for which no biological basis had been found and included schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychosis (now bipolar affective disorder), and psychotic depression. By de- fault, these were regarded as having intrapsychic origins.

However, techniques to detect brain pathologies in the living patient were crude. One was electroencephalography (EEG), another x-ray. By midcentury, Hill and Parr (1950) concluded that the EEG’s practical value was to enable us to know something about organic cerebral disorder but little else. Information also came from cases of patients who had suffered externally inﬂicted damage to the brain and where the locus of the injury could be relatively easily identiﬁed. (German neuropsychiatrist Conrad Rieger employed a bat- tery of such tests as early as 1888.) It was time-consuming to administer, consisting of forty different tests (Benton, 1991). In the aftermath of each of the two world wars much research into brain-damaged patients provided a knowledge base about the effects of injuries to speciﬁc psychological func- tions. World War I gave rise to numerous neuropsychological tests, mostly from German sources. Asecond major wave oc- curred after World War II, primarily in the United States.

German psychologist Kurt Goldstein made an impor- tant contribution to this research. In a seminal monograph, Goldstein and Scheerer (1941) reported studies of brain- damaged patients. Their results had led them to formulate the hypothesis that substantial brain damage produced a loss of “abstract attitude.” Schizophrenia patients tested with the same tests used on brain-damaged patients performed in sim- ilar ways, supporting the view that the functional psychoses were essentially organic.
