Decide if you really want to manage. Global business culture gloriﬁes

leadership, but if you love doing, managing others might not be right for you. Coming to terms with this can be diﬃcult but rewarding. For

example, even as the newly appointed head of the M&A practice worked

to learn new skills in delegating and leading teams, he realized he still
