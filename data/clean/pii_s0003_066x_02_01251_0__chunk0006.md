# Impact on Jobs in the United States

As nations around the world move from wartime to peacetime economies, from industrial societies to infor- mation societies, we are witnessing wrenching structural changes in our economy. These changes have impacted most profoundly in terms of jobs (Cascio, 1993). In the United States, more than 7 million permanent layoffs have been announced since 1987. That number includes 6 million between 1987 and 1992 (Baumohl, 1993), 615,000 in 1993 (Byrne, 1994), and 516,000 in 1994 (Murray, 1995).

Companies are not downsizing because they are los- ing money. Fully 81% of companies that downsize in a given year were profitable in that year. Major reasons, according to the American Management Association’s 1994 survey on downsizing, were strategic or structural in nature: to improve productivity, transfers of location, new technological processes, mergers and acquisitions, or plant obsolescence (“1994 AMA”).

Laid-off workers who must return to the job market often must take huge pay cuts. Downward mobility is the rule rather than the exception (“‘Downside,” 1994). Of

roughly 2,000 workers let go by RJR Nabisco, for ex-

ample, 72% found jobs subsequently but at wages that

averaged only 47% of their previous pay (“Jobs,” 1993).
