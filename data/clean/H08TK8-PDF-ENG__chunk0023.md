## intelligence, composure under pressure, and resilience. Further, it

enhances our psychological well-being and increases the compassion

we show to others. Practicing self-compassion simply means treating

yourself as you would a friend: acknowledging the challenge,

recognizing anyone in your position might feel the same way, and

responding with kindness instead of criticism.

After hard moments, ask yourself: What would I say to a colleague

struggling with this same situation? Then extend that same support

inward. This quiet act of self-kindness will help you feel better, recover faster, and lead more eﬀectively.
