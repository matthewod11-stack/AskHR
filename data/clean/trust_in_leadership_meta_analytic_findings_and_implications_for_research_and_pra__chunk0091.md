# Summary and Conclusion

In attempting to summarize, integrate, and extend the literature on trust in leadership, we intended to make several contributions and advances with this article. First, we attempted to amass and summarize three decades of empirical research on trust in leader- ship. In doing so, we have provided “best evidence” for the primary relationships between trust and 23 other variables. Sec- ond, we have attempted to discuss the implications of specifying the construct with different definitions of trust (cognitive vs. overall) and different leadership referents of trust (direct leaders vs. organizational leadership). Third, we have offered a theoretical framework to help provide parsimony to the expansive literature and help clarify different perspectives on the development and consequences of trust. In addressing the above issues, we hope to provide a foundation for future research on trust in leadership.
