# and decision-making:

- Model: Within the agent's framework, the term "model" pertains to the language

model (LM) that functions as the central decision-making unit, employing instruction-

based reasoning and logical frameworks. The model can vary from general-purpose to

multimodal or fine-tuned, depending on the agent's specific requirements.

- Tools: Tools are critical for bridging the divide between the agent's internal capabilities

and the external world, facilitating interaction with external data and services. These

tools empower agents to access and process real-world information. Tools can include

extensions, functions, and data stores. Extensions bridge the gap between an API and

an agent, enabling agents to seamlessly execute APIs. Functions are self-contained

modules of code that accomplish specific tasks. Data stores provide access to dynamic

and up-to-date information, ensuring a modelâ€™s responses remain grounded in factuality
