# The Boss

The boss often has a limited opportunity to observe his or her subordinates. Thus, a boss appraisal usually does not provide a complete picture of an employee’s perfor- mance. Consequently, supervisory apprai- sals frequently fail to improve a person’s performance and may lead to employee hos- tility. Such questions as: ‘‘On what basis are

you able to evaluate me?’’ undermine the credibility of the boss. The employee views the appraisal as unfair. The boss should be held accountable primarily for collecting data for appraising an individual from multi- ple sources, and then making the ﬁnal administrative and developmental decisions based on these multiple sources of informa- tion.
