## IDENTIFYING PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY

Standardized assessment of personality characteristics and psychopathology emerged from four separate threads of his- tory differentiated by their distinctive procedures. A ﬁrst thread involves relatively structured procedures in which respondents reply to a ﬁxed number of speciﬁc questions by selecting their answer from a prescribed list of alternatives (e.g., Question: “Do you feel unhappy?” Answers: “Most of the time,” “Occasionally,” “Hardly ever”). Such relatively structured measures are commonly referred to as self-report methods, given that the data they provide constitute what people are able and willing to say about themselves.

A second thread consists of relatively unstructured proce- dures in which respondents are presented with somewhat ambiguous test stimuli and given rather vague instructions concerning what they should say about or do with these stim- uli (e.g., shown a picture of a boy looking at a violin, the respondent is asked to make up a story that has a beginning and an end and includes how the boy is feeling and what he is thinking about). Measures of this kind have traditionally been called “projective” tests, because they invite respondents to attribute characteristics to test stimuli that are based on their own impressions rather than known fact (e.g., “The boy is feeling sad”) or give them considerable latitude to complete tasks in whatever manner they prefer (asked by respondents about how they should proceed on these measures, examiners typically answer with statements like “It’s up to you” or “Any way you like”).

However, most so-called projective tests have some clearly deﬁned as well as ambiguous aspects and include spe- ciﬁc as well as vague instructions (a violin is a violin, and “What will happen to him?” is a precise request for informa- tion). Accordingly, instead of being labeled “projective” measures, these relatively unstructured assessment instru-
