## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

A number of states have family leave statutes. Nothing in the FMLA supersedes a provision of state law that is more beneﬁcial to the employee, and employers must comply with the more beneﬁcial provision. Under some

circumstances, an employee with a disability may have rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
