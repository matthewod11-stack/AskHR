# Proximal Omnibus Context

Organizational Demography In previous sections, we considered how occupational or industry level demographics can inﬂuence diversity-related outcomes in organizations. While acknowledging that demographics of the occupation or industry sets limits on the available skilled labor pool for the organization, in this section we consider the contextual inﬂuences of demographics within the organiza- tion on the outcomes of work group. In the management literature, a signiﬁcant body of research pioneered by Pfeffer (1983) has considered how organizational demography can shape diversity-related outcomes.

The demography of an organization provides a roadmap for understanding the impact of status and relative proportions on interactional processes between demographic groups. Two objective characteristics of organization’s demographic composition can inﬂuence these factors – the overall hetero- geneity of the organization (in terms of the representation of demographic groups in the organization) and the level of structural integration (the representation of minority groups at higher levels in the organization) (see Cox, 1991; Joshi, 2006). The degree to which an organization is structurally segregated can be a powerful inﬂuence on social category-based identiﬁcation and conﬂict among demographic groups (Cox, 1993; Ely, 1994; Wharton, 1992). In structurally segregated organizations, the balance of power and status is skewed in favor of the dominant demographic group; these status and power differentials in this context can undermine inter-group harmony and cooperation within the work group (Cox, 1993).

Ely’s (1994, 1995) deﬁnitive work on the social construction of gender identity in organizations highlights the powerful inﬂuence that organizational
