## A Multilevel Framework for Work Team Diversity Research

diversity dynamics. For example, over the past three decades, age-related trends in the US workforce have heightened the age diversity within organizations. For the ﬁrst time in employment history, four generational groups are working alongside each other. It is possible that these age-based trends change the nature of inter- and intra-generational interactions within work groups which, in turn, can shape the outcomes of age diversity in teams (see Dencker, Joshi, & Martocchio, 2007). As evidenced in the 2001 Academy of Management Review’s special issue on the effects of time in organizations, the broader domain of management research has acknowl- edged the relevance of considering temporal factors in research. We propose that a similar effort be made in diversity research.
