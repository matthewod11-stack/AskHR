## HBR / Digital Article / Using Fiction to Find Your Strategy

Over the past seven years in working with about 50 executive teams

around the world, we’ve been experimenting with an alternative

approach to strategy: design fiction. Design fiction is a technique that

immerses executives and employees deeply in various possible futures,

and uses artifacts such as short movies, fictitious newspaper articles,

and imaginary commercials to generate transformation roadmaps.

Rooted in the future but helping to act in the present, design fiction

results in concrete actions taken to adjust companies’ visions, strategies,

and activities to create a better future.

Unlike many strategic foresight tools, design fiction does not attempt

to identify what is more likely to happen. Nor does it limit strategy

conversations to the C-suite; in fact a core component is the

participation of a wide range of stakeholders. Consequently, the teams

that we’ve seen deploy design fiction are able to formulate and shape

desirable futures that other tools do not enable people to see.
