# Talent

GROWTH DRIVER MODEL (Example: independent accelerator collaborating with a large corporation and investors)

Mediated: Higher-risk products are developed by trusted teams with assurance of fit.

Minimized: R&D costs are off balance- sheet, and price is preset below M&A value.

Maximized: Collaboration with the accelerator to develop products fills in portfolio gaps.

Moderated: Development teams have autonomy, but accelerator teams guide efforts toward the corporationâ€™s needs.

Mobilized and motivated: Talent can focus on what it does best.
