## Chapter 9 • Performance Management Skills

- Discuss approval and appeals process. Finally, the supervisor asks the employee to sign the form to attest that the evaluation has been discussed with him. This is also an opportunity for the employee to add any comments or additional information he would like to see included on the form. In addition, if disagreements about ratings have not been resolved, the supervisor should remind the employee of the appeals process.

- Conduct final recap. Finally, the supervisor should use the “past-present-future model.” In other words, the supervisor summarizes what happened during the review period in terms of performance levels in the various dimensions, reviews how rewards will change based on this level of performance, and sums up what the employee will need to do in the next year to maintain and enhance performance.

Performance review discussions serve very important purposes. First, these discussions allow employees to improve their performance by identifying performance problems and solutions for overcoming them. Second, they help build a good relation- ship between the supervisor and the employee because the supervisor shows that she cares about the employee’s ongoing growth and development and that she is willing to invest resources, including time, in helping the employee improve.

Unfortunately, these purposes are not always realized because employees may be defensive, and many supervisors do not know how to deal with this attitude because they lack the necessary skills to conduct an effective performance review. How can we tell when an employee is being defensive? Typically, there are two patterns of behavior that indicate defensiveness.49 First, employees may engage in a fight response. This includes blaming others for performance deficiencies, staring mutely at the supervisor, and other, more aggressive responses such as raising her voice or even pounding the desk. Second, employ- ees may engage in a flight response. This includes looking away, turning away, speaking softly, continually changing the subject, or quickly agreeing with what the supervisor is say- ing without basing the agreement on a thoughtful and thorough discussion about the issues at stake. When employees have a fight-or-flight response during the performance review discussion, it is unlikely that the meeting will lead to improved performance in the future. What can supervisors do to prevent defensive responses? Consider the following suggestions:

- Establish and maintain rapport.

It is important that the meeting take place in a good climate. As noted earlier, this can be achieved by choosing a meeting place that is private and by preventing interruptions from taking place. Also, the super- visor should emphasize two-way communication and put the employee at ease as quickly as possible. This can be done by sitting next to the employee as opposed to across a desk, by saying his name, by thanking him for coming, and by beginning with small talk to reduce the initial tension. When good rapport is established, both the supervisor and the employee are at ease, relaxed, and comfortable. They can have a friendly conversation, and neither is afraid to speak freely. Both are open-minded and can express disagreement without offending one another. On the other hand, when there is no good rapport, both participants may be nervous and anxious. The conversation is cold and formal and both may fear to speak openly. The supervisor and employee are likely to interrupt each other frequently and challenge what the other is saying.
