# Contract execution

This requires the contractor runtime to be able to fulfill the contracts and solve the

tasks behind contracts according to their defined specifications. Prioritizing quality and

completeness over latency enables to fully leverage the capabilities of LLMs, for example

by generating different solutions, and reviewing, scoring, and evolving them. An example of

this methodology is shown below in the Co-Scientist study. The engine can iterate and self-

validate the results and deliverables based on the provided expectations, and can improve

and self-correct until the validators are fulfilled. The ability to concretely validate a solution

against a set of objective criteria has proven to work extremely well in the context of AI and

has been at the core of successful AI systems such as for example Alpha-Code.
