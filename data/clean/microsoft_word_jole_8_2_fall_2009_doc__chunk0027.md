Table 3 lists the correlations between length of team participation and leadership skill levels. This analysis provides information relative to two of the research questions – Q2: Are increasing levels of participation associated with increasing levels of leadership and Q3: Does the nature of the sport affect the skills developed? The only sports individually analyzed were those in which some participation was reported by at least 15% (n = 25) of the study’s participants.
