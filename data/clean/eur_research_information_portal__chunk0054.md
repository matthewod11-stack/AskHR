willing and motivated to voice discrepant perspectives for fear of triggering conﬂict or even ostracism (Dutton & Heaphy, 2003; Gruenfeld, Mannix, Williams & Neale, 1996). In contrast, research suggests that information is absorbed more completely (Wenger, 2000) and people are better able to open up to diverse viewpoints (Carmeli, Brueller & Dutton, 2009) in the safety of positive relationships (Spreitzer et al., 2005).

Thus, a group’s social capital represents a crucial emergence-enabling state that determines whether individual-level perspectives, expertise, and unique strengths result in value-creating synergies rather than conﬂict. More speciﬁcally, as described by Ray, Nyberg and Maltarich (in press), the denser the network ties in a group, the less likely it is for information to remain siloed in subgroups, and the easier it is for members to synchronize their behaviors and enforce norms through regular communication. Furthermore, the more existing social ties are characterizedby likingandgoodwill (i.e.,relational social capital),thegreaterthe willingness of group members to help each other and work productively through conﬂict. Finally, a group’s cognitive social capital, or the extent to which systems of meaning are shared, has a positive impact on how effectively members communicate and understand each other and coordinate their behaviors. Not surprisingly, social capital characteristics are even more important for synergistic performance outcomes to emerge in diverse groups (Ray et al., in press).

A critical function of inclusive leadership for optimizing the group’s ability to avoid conﬂict and engage in information elaboration is therefore to pri- oritize building strong, personalized relationships within the workgroup (Mor Barak, 2017; Nishii, 2013). Because processing individuating information requires more cognitive resources than relying on efﬁcient, stereotype-based thinking, it is important for leaders to proactively provide the time and space needed for workgroup members to discover individuating information about each other. As Roberson and Perry (pp. 755–778) found, leaders do this in part by highlighting what is shared or similar among workgroup members and cultivating regular team interactions.
