# Communication Factors

Burke identified the "mystery" that surrounds hierarchical communication, "... the conditions for 'mystery' are set by any pronounced social distinction . .. the social dis- tinction between clerk and office/manager makes them subtly mysterious to each other, not merely two different people, but representing two classes or 'kinds' of people."28 The existence of mystery between classes of beings points out an essential quality of the performance appraisal interview. a superior will be communicating with an inferior in the organization. Goodall,. Wilson, and Waagen pointed out that when mystery inter- cedes in communication between different classes of beings, the common response is to retreat to ritual forms of address; that is, communicative behaviors that are guided by commonly understood cultural and social stereotypes, traditional etiquette, gender- specific, or race-specific rules.29 Both interviewer and interviewee are encouraged to rely on and to respond to prepackaged scripts for the situation that derive rules from commonly understood cultural values and standards.3Â° In short, the mystery present in the situation is reinforced by ntual forms of cornmunication."1 In the face of pressures to retreat to fixed, conventional forms of communication between appraiser/appraisee, the appraiser must assume responsibility to assure that the barrier is broken and that honest, open communication occurs.

Although some experts in performance appraisal advocate that managers treat employees as equals,'' it does not follow that the employee will adopt this attitude or that such attempts of managers will be credible, especially if the manager's behavior is not consistent with past behavior.'" Review of the literature suggests that the primary way to reduce the "mystery" in supervisor/subordinate communisation is to facilitate participation of the subordinate, the manager needs skills that encourages subordinates to talk.14 Participation is encouraged through active listening,15 manager behaviors that are spontaneous, friendly, sensitive, that show interest in subordinates, and that are nonjudgmental.16 The best place for the appraisal interview is a neutral setting and not in the manager's office, thus reducing the distance over which communication occurs. Finally, Goodall et al. discussed the central purpose of performance appraisal interviews from the frame of reference of both the supervisor and the subordinate.37 They stressed the need for clarity of purpose of the appraisal for each party. When there is a common understanding of what the parameters of the performance interview are, the appraisee is more likely to experience the safety required for self disclosure and risk-taking, thereby making the interview a more authentic, spontaneous experience. Bellman stated, "A performance discussion without objectives is not a performance discussion."38 In summary, the negative effects of status differences on communication within the performance interview are mitigated when the appraiser (1) assumes responsibility to see that effective communication occurs, (2) listens carefully, (3) clarifies interview purposes and goals, and (4) involves the appraisee in all phases of performance appraisal, including the design of the program.'9 When possible, the employer should be allowed to rate his own performance:10

The fact that performance appraisals exist in part to pros ide evaluative feedback to appraisees constitutes in performance appraisal. Bennett and Chater underscored this aspect of appraisal in postsecondary settings They cited several current concerns in higher education that have led faculty and administrators alike to tighten their judgments. Bennett and Chater especially made
