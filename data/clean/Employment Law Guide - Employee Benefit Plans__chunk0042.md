# Health Laws Under Part 7 of ERISA

Many Federal laws have been enacted to amend ERISA to provide important protections for participants and

beneﬁciaries of group health plans and health insurance coverage oﬀered in connection with group health plans. These protections are generally found under Part 7 of Subtitle B of title I of ERISA.

The Patient Protection and Aﬀordable Care Act (the Aﬀordable Care Act or ACA). The Aﬀordable Care Act

amended ERISA to incorporate several health coverage market reforms. These provisions are set forth in

Public Health Service Act sections 2701 through 2728, which are incorporated by reference in ERISA section

- 715. These provisions include rules relating to the prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions, the prohibition of lifetime and annual dollar limits for essential health beneﬁts, the prohibition of rescissions, and required coverage of certain preventive services without cost sharing.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The Health Insurance Portability and

Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) amended ERISA to provide for improved portability and continuity of health

coverage connected with employment, among other things. These provisions include rules relating to special enrollment rights, and prohibition of discrimination against individuals based on health status.

The Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996 (Newborns' Act) requires plans that oﬀer maternity

coverage to pay for at least a 48 hour hospital stay in connection with childbirth (a 96 hour stay in connection

with a cesarean section).
