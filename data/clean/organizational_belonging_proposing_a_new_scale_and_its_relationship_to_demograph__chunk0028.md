p. 248) “I really don’t fit in this company,” “I could disappear for days and nobody at the company would miss me.”

More recently, Malone, Pillow, and Osman (2012) developed a 12-item, two factor General Belongingness Scale (GPS). The two factors, six-items each, are acceptance/inclusion and lack of rejection/exclusion. Sample items (Malone et al., 2012, p. 31) include: “when I am with other people, I feel included” and “I feel connected with others” (acceptance/inclusion) versus “with other people I feel like a stranger” and “I feel isolated from the rest of the world” (rejection/exclusion). The use of similar wording and ant- onym items would seem to play a big role in the strong psychometric data presented for both the SOBI and GPS scales (Stanton et al., 2002). However, a more recent 10-item Need to Belong scale does not seem to suffer these drawbacks (Leary, Kelly, Cottrell, & Schreindorfer, 2013). Yet, this is still a general belonging scale, not focusing on Organizational Belonging. Expanding the literature search on OB, several qualitative stud- ies were found offering the potential for enlarging its item domain coverage.

Summary critique of prior related OB research Again of a variety of samples have been utilized, including: Indian man- agerial executives (Jena & Pradham, 2018); U.S. corporate employees (Randall et al., 2020); employees of a Singapore bank (Gao et al., 2022); Australian volunteer ambulance workers and volunteer emergency service workers (Huynh et al., 2012); U.S. community college students, patients in mental health treatment, and Roman Catholic nuns (Hagerty & Patusky, 1995); Spanish contract service employees (Davila & Garcia, 2012); and U.S. college students (Malone et al., 2012; (Leary et al., 2013). There are domestic and non-U.S. samples across these studies. However, the measures used across these studies have narrow domain coverage, and do not adequately address the breadth of the OB construct (Belle et al., 2015).

Qualitative research enlarging the Item domain for measuring OB Three qualitative studies on OB or general belonging were helpful (Belle et al., 2015; Filstad, Traavik, & Gorli, 2019; McClure & Brown, 2008). Belle et al. (2015) interviewed 10 teleworkers asking each the question “how do teleworkers and labeling each depending on their answers. Examples (Belle et al., 2015, p. 85–86), of the first responder—“having label given and their abbreviated quotes were: space for one’s expression of full empowerment and liberty to engage fully”; anonymous professional—“non-discriminatory, fact-based acknow- ledgement by others of one’s abilities,” and teamster—“it is akin to
