# Transform the Business

A public company was pursuing an aggressive new growth strategy after a recent business reorganization. But it was risky, and the firm wanted executives’ incentives to reflect that. So it made a large amount of management’s pay contin­ gent on successfully executing the strategy, which included entering new product markets, changing sales channels, and expanding geographic reach. The compensation committee defined success as a significant increase in shareholder value over three years. In other words, the market would determine whether the executives had implemented the strategy well.

The Elements of Long- Term Compensation Because long-term incentives make up the majority of executive compensation and have the most variations, they deserve special attention. Key vehicles include:

Stock-appreciation rights. Like options, these increase in value if the stock price rises, and may expire. Unlike options, they don’t have to be exercised. Instead employees receive the value of the appreciation in shares or in cash.

Restricted stock. Restricted shares are essentially common shares that cannot be sold immediately. They become sellable according to a vesting schedule, which encourages retention. However, the beneﬁts of stock ownership (such as dividends) often accrue from the time of the award.

Performance shares. These are stock allocations that are distributed only when preestablished goals, such as operating or ﬁnancial results or stock or shareholder returns, are achieved. The goals may be absolute targets or based on performance relative to peers’.

Stock options. These give employees the right to purchase stock at a predetermined price (the exercise price) during a set period (the term). The stock price must improve for the award to have value.

Phantom equity. This cash- based award is structured to mimic an equity award. The value of a company’s equity is tracked over time and determines the amount executives receive.

When setting long­term incentives, the committee decided

to deviate from the norm in three key ways. First it chose to front­load three years of awards and forgo future annual awards. Second the awards were delivered only if the firm hit certain share­price targets. Third the awards were based on a scale, and the targets and vesting schedules were set so that average performance resulted in minimal awards. However, under this plan executives would be rewarded for the risks they took because they could get more compensation sooner than they would have under a traditional approach.

potential solutions. First it considered paying above­market cash compensation (base and bonus). But that would have increased annual cash costs significantly without fostering a sense of ownership, linking compensation to better perfor­ mance, or creating multiyear accountability.

Next the company considered three long­term incentives

that could compete with public competitors’ packages: real equity (which the company ruled out because it intended to remain private and therefore had no simple liquidity mech­ anism), phantom equity (ruled out because of complexities in design, administration, and communication, particularly around valuation methodology), and multiyear cash incen­ tives, which it ultimately adopted.
