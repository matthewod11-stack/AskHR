# Assess your part.

Your direct report may very well have poor time management. But you

might want to consider whether you also have poor time management

skills and in which ways, if any, you’re contributing to the problem.

If you send over assignments last minute, don’t give clear direction,

refuse to set priorities, have no follow-up system, or forget to give

feedback, then your actions could be playing a role in the situation.

If you also expect your employees to be constantly available through

email, chat, or other channels, so they can’t set boundaries to complete

focused work, you’re also partially at fault for the struggles they face.

By identifying these issues in advance of the feedback conversation, you

can go in acknowledging where you could also have done better.

Pinpoint the stress.

Earlier this year, I had a situation I found very stressful with an outside

contractor. There was a large project that I needed them to complete,

and they were very delayed. One day as I was thinking about it, I

realized that within the larger project, there were just a couple of

distinct items that mattered most. Once those were done, my stress

would dramatically decrease, and the other parts could take more time.

By clarifying my most important needs, I felt much less stressed and

could communicate what I needed to get back most urgently, even if the

whole project wasn’t done.
