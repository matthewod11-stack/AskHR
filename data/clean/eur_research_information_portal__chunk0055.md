# Inclusive Leadership as a Moderator of Second-Stage Relationships (Figure 1, link 2b)

Inclusive leadership requires leaders to adapt their behaviors based on ob- servations of emergent diversity dynamics (cf. Homan et al., 2020). This involves internal reﬂection or meta-cognition on the part of the leader about their effectiveness in cultivating inclusive climates (Nishii & Leroy, 2021) as well as their efforts to spur members to engage in team reﬂexivity. Related to information elaboration, van Knippenberg and van Ginkel (pp. 779–797)
