For example, the CEO who designed the strategic portfolio review

process attended ﬁve of the 12 meetings. He attended the ﬁrst two to

set the right tone and direction. He then allowed the team to do its

homework. He did one check-in in the middle of the process to ensure

things were on track. Finally, he re-engaged by attending the last two

meetings when the group presented its recommendations.

In contrast, on the cost-cutting workstream, he attended no meetings

and instead asked the CFO and CHRO to brief him on their progress and

to seek his input whenever they felt it would be helpful.
