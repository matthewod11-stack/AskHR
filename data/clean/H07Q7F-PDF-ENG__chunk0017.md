# Make feedback part of the process.

Feedback should be a regular ritual, not an occasional blast. Making

feedback a habit ensures the tiny annoyances and frustrations you

harbor don’t blow up into major conﬂicts. Plus, gradually exposing

yourself to fearful situations is the best way to overcome them. The

more you practice giving feedback in lower-stakes, everyday scenarios

as part of your role, the better at it you’ll become.

A great way to systematize feedback is through regular one-on-ones

with your team. You can also schedule project debriefs where team

members can reﬂect, or pre-mortems where people can discuss in

advance any risks, potential problems, and ﬂesh out how they’ll work
