# Individual Differences in Engagement

Are there certain personal characteristics of employees that are associated with their level of work engagement? There is not yet a clear answer to this question. However, a few studies do offer some preliminary findings on individual differences in work engagement. For demographic factors, engagement tends to be slightly higher among older workers and slightly higher for men, but these differences are small.12 One study examined the associations between work engagement and employee self-reports of perceived health, psychological well-being, and social relationships.9 Not surprisingly, it found higher engagement among employees who defined themselves as having better psychological well-being, better physical health and stronger social relationships. Lower engagement is more common among employees who report working too much and too many hours (i.e., workaholism) and also is more common among those who report they experience psychological hopelessness and despair concerning their work (i.e., job burnout).9,12 A study of over 10,000 employees in the U.K. found that greater engagement was associated with higher job grade (managers and executives), professional
