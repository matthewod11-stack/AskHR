## HBR / Digital Article / Research: Remote Workers Are More Anxious About Layoffs

single person on your team. Carefully review your list and consider

each individual’s strengths and areas where they might need (or want)

development. Then make a more informed, intentional decision.

Think carefully about how you use 1:1 time.

Our research shows that 49% of employees feel anxious before 1:1s with

their manager. These meetings oﬀer a great opportunity to intervene

and try to alleviate your team’s anxiety, but you might need to

reconsider how you run them.

Do you ask check-in questions (think: “How can I best support you?” or

“Is anything unclear or blocking your work?”) and seek input from your

reports? You can do a lot to calm an insecure employee by saying, “Your

skills are very unique and important to this company, and I value your

opinion and expertise. What do you think of this?”

If you focus your 1:1s on status updates, you miss out on a valuable

opportunity to better understand and support your people. Worse, you

inadvertently send the message that you only care about pressing tasks

and to-do’s, which can leave your team feeling expendable and stressed.

Think about whether there are alternative channels (think email or

Slack threads) in which you can get status updates.

Reflect on how you show up as a manager.

As a manager, you have an outsize impact on how employees feel

in their day-to-day–and on what they feel safe sharing. A big part of

your job is to create an environment in which each team member feels

comfortable being genuine and ﬂagging concerns.
