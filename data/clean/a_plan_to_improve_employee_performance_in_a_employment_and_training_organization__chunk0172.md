At Employers ' Training Resource, there exist many issues confronting

management , regarding employee performance and many angles this project could have

taken. Given the necessary time, information and resources, the author would like to

implement a policy providing for a standard, uniform Training program. ETR does not

have a consistent training policy for all employees in the Intake and Assessment

department. A recommendation to develop a program that will provide full, proper and

equal training for new and existing employees should be considered for a future project or

department committee. This can be done by, first, conduct a needs analysis of employee

training needs; secondly, develop an agenda for training; thirdly, develop areas of training

and outline a program that addresses each of those training areas; and lastly, publish a

42

training manual that can be referred to for future training of new and existing employees .

In retrospect , developing a training program for all employees is an excellent option to

improving employee performance in the Intake and Assessment department at ETR.
