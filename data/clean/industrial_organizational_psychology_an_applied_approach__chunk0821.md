# Hires Selection ratio

If the statistical test suggests that the selection rate differences would prob- ably not have occurred by chance, the next step is to use a test of practical signifi- cance. That is, is the difference between the two groups at a level high enough to suggest potential discrimination? Although there are several methods of deter- mining practical significance, by far the most common is the four-fifths rule. With the four-fifths rule, the percentage of applicants hired from one group (e.g., women, Hispanics) is compared to the percentage of applicants hired in the most favored group (e.g., men, whites). If the percentage of applicants hired in the dis- advantaged group is less than % of the percentage for the advantaged group, adverse impact is said to have occurred.

It is important to keep in mind that adverse impact refers to percentages rather than raw numbers. For example, as shown in Table ., if  of  male applicants are hired, the hiring percentage is %. If ten females applied, at least four would need to be hired to avoid adverse impact. Why four? Because the hiring percentage for women must be at least % of the hiring percentage for men. Because the male- hiring percentage in this case is %, the hiring percentage for females must be at least four-fifths (%) of %. Thus, . (. = ., indicating that at least % of all female applicants need to be hired to avoid adverse impact and a potential charge of unfair discrimination. With ten applicants, this results in hiring at least four.

Adverse impact is computed separately for race and gender. That is, an orga- nization would not compute hiring rates for White males or African American females. Instead, hiring rates would be computed for males and for females and then be computed separately for Whites and for African Americans.

It is illegal to intentionally discriminate against Whites and males, but employ- ment practices that result in adverse impact against White males, although tech- nically illegal, are not illegal in practice. No court has upheld an adverse impact claim by a White applicant. For example, it was mentioned previously that requir- ing a college degree adversely impacts African Americans because .% of Whites have bachelor’s degrees compared with .% of African Americans and .% of Hispanics. Though % of Asian Americans have college degrees, a White appli- cant could not realistically file a discrimination charge based on adverse impact.
