# Exhibit 2

The position of Director, Instructional and Student Development, is a state level administrative position. The sample Performance Appraisal Form shown is similar to that used in Exhibit 1, with key expectations included as an added dimension. Weighted job domains are entered on the form and defined in pc.:ormance-related terms. Key expectations for the rating period will have been entered from the previous review session when these were developed. Each of these areas is then rated against the five-point scale. Part III addresses factors which impact on the performance of the job but do not fall under specific duty statements. These are not rated on a scale; rather are discussed in narrative form. The remaining sections of this form are self-explanatory.
