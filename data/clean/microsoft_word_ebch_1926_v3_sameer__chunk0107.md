# Objectives of Training and Development

The improvement of people's job performance is one of the goals that is of the utmost importance. People are required to participate in the programme if they lack knowledge or are unfamiliar with specific techniques and approaches that are relevant to carrying out their job obligations. They can improve their knowledge, skills, and abilities by participating in the programme, which enables them to carry out their job responsibilities effectively. The organisational structure places the workforce at various levels, and the programmes are set up in accordance with how each person's job responsibilities are divided up. These programmes show to be helpful to employees when they through any changes in their lives, such as accidents, transfers, resignations, or any other foreseeable events. The fundamental benefit of these programmes is that persons who must take time off from work can get all the information they need by attending the programme. Information gained during the programme can be applied when the participant returns to or even changes jobs.
