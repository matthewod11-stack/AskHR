# 1.4.6 Work/Life Focus

Benefits related to work/life focus include programs that help employees achieve a better balance between work and nonwork activities. These include time away from work (e.g., vacation time), services to meet specific needs (e.g., counseling, financial planning, on-site fitness program), and flexible work schedules (e.g., telecommuting, nonpaid time off). For example, Sun Microsystems actively promotes an equal balance between work and home life and closes its Broomfield, Colorado, campus from late December through early January every year. This benefit (i.e., vacation time for all employees in addition to indi- vidual yearly vacation time) is part of Sun’s culture. Sun believes in a work hard–play hard attitude, as is evidenced by CEO Scott McNealy’s motto: “Kick butt and have fun.”30
