qualified applicants is a critical component in the success of our operation, particularly in light of the volatile nature of the materials our employees are exposed to in their work environment.

Whether a position is a new or an existing one, the first step in recruiting is to ensure that an accurate job description exists for the position. Information from this job description is utilized for development of the internal personnel requisition and in advertisements for the position. The appropriate market for advertising the position is determined by the type of position to be filled. Entry-level production positions are generally filled in partnership with the local employment commission, in addition to newspaper advertisements as needed. Recruiting for technical or management-level positions requires a broader focus. Recruiting for professional, scientific, and managerial

positions often includes a national search. In national searches, it is essential to use a variety of recruitment methods to reach more potential applicants. All open positions are posted on the company’s website, which includes a database searchable by location, facility, or job category.

Candidates may complete

an online application and attach a résumé file to their online application. For critical or difficult-to-fill positions, Alliant Techsystems offers an incentive to employees to encourage referrals of candidates for these positions. In addition to the company website, a variety of other advertising resources are used, including local and national newspapers, trade and professional organizations, and online job search services. Another important aspect of our recruiting involves participation in on-campus recruiting efforts and hosting information booths

at professional association meetings. The participation in these events is generally a team-based approach involving recruiting staff from several company locations.

As with most organizations,

an important part of the selection process is the employment interview. To increase the effectiveness of the interview as a selection tool, a structured interview is used for all open positions. For each position, a set of essential competencies is identified. Questions for each competency are developed and may be either technical or situational in nature. A panel whose members are selected by the hiring manager interviews the applicants. Each interviewer takes notes during the interview and completes a standard rating sheet on each of the applicants. The ratings are utilized to identify the successful candidate for the position. Using a structured interview and a panel of interviewers reduces the bias involved in typical interviews.

of successful employees free maid service for a full year. The average amount of such bonuses offered by organizations is less than $, (SHRM, a). The typical time period that a new employee must stay with the company before the referring employee is eligible for a bonus is three months (Stewart, Ellenburg, Hicks, Kremen, & Daniel, ). Stewart and his colleagues () found no rela- tionship between the size of the bonus and the number of referrals, nor did they find that organizations offering referral bonuses received more referrals than did organizations not offering bonuses. Though such a finding might be surprising, % of employees said they made a referral to help a friend, and another % said they made the referral to help their employer. Only % reported making the referral for the incentive (Lachnit, ).

Although employee referrals are an effective means of recruiting employ- ees, care must be taken when developing a referral program to ensure that the referral pool is representative of the ethnic and racial make-up of the qualified workforce. Such care is important as research indicates that % of the friends of white employees and % of the friends of African American employees are of the same race, and % of job applicants used their social networks to help find a job (Mouw, ). Thus, if most of an organization’s employees are white, so will be most of the employee referrals.

Although the idea of employee referrals sounds good, not all referrals are the same. Aamodt and Carr () and Rupert () compared the success of employees who had been referred by current successful and unsuccessful employees and found that employees referred by successful employees had longer tenure than did employees who had been referred by unsuccessful employees. Thus, only those referrals made by successful employees should be considered. This finding, explained by social psychology research, indicates that our friends tend to be similar to us in characteristics such as personality, values, and interests. If a particular employee is a good employee, then the same characteristics that make her a good employee are probably shared by her friends and family. The same would be true of an unsuccessful employee.

Even though referrals by successful employees are a good recruitment ave- nue, the similarity of friends can also pose some problems. The biggest is that our friends also tend to be the same gender, race, national origin, and religion as we are. Thus, if an organization uses employee referrals and the organization consists predominantly of white male Protestants, it will seldom hire African Americans or females. Thus, even though the organization didn’t intend to discriminate, the consequences of its recruitment policy may have that effect. However, organiza- tions such as Alpine Banks of Colorado have used this similarity bias to their advantage by asking its bilingual employees to refer bilingual applicants.
