section of the United States has shown that microaggressions, a form of exclusion, are more likely in predominantly white organizational contexts than in diverse organizational contexts (Meyers et al., 2020). This points to the risks for marginalized group members of accepting employment in less di- verse organizations as they increase their likelihood of experiencing exclusion.

Finally, leader exclusion by a white male leader toward women and other stigmatized social identity group members may be interpreted as an act of discrimination, especially if there is a pattern of such leader behavior. Em- ployees who are in the same social identity group and observe or learn about the leader exclusionary treatment may assume the exclusion was discrimi- natory, leading to turnover of other stigmatized employees (Simon, Kinias, O’Brien, Major, & Bivolaru, 2013). Furthermore, a pattern of leader ex- clusionary treatment that prevents women, people of color, immigrants, and sexual minorities from equal opportunities in the workplace for pay and promotion may also result in Title VII lawsuits, hurting the organization’s reputation, and possible ﬁnancial loss as well due to damages incurred to plaintiffs (Dworkin, Schipani, Milliken, & Kneeland, 2018).
