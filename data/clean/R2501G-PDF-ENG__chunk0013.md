# Barriers to Scaling Up Experimentation

Data science teams often lead the adoption of online experimentation.

After initial success, organizations tend to fall into a rut, and the returns

remain limited. A common pattern we see is this: The organization

invests in a platform technically capable of designing, running, and

analyzing experiments. Large technology companies build their own

platforms in-house; others typically buy them from vendors. Although

these tools are widely available, investing in them is costly. Building a

platform can take more than a year and usually requires a team of ﬁve

to 10 engineers. External platforms generally cost less and are faster to

implement, but they still require dedicated resources to be integrated

with the organization’s internal development processes and to gain
