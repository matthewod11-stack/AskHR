# Measures

Three dependent variables—enrollment in the coaching pro- gram, active participation in the program, and behavior change for individuals who enrolled in the program—were created. Information on the program is available in previously published studies.32

An individual was considered enrolled in a coaching program when he or she accepted an invitation from the Vendor to participate in the program. If the individual completed an HA, using the Web- based format, eligible individuals received an electronic invitation to enrollinthecoachingprogramthatwasrendereduponcompletionof the HA. If the individual completed a paper HA, eligible individuals received a print invitation that the Vendor mailed to their home address along with the printed results of their HA. Individuals could enroll by completing the paper enrollment card and returning it in a postage-paid envelope or by calling a toll-free number provided by the Vendor. If an eligible individual did not respond to the Web- based or print invitation, the Vendor completed up to ﬁve outbound telephone call attempts to an individual’s home to notify them of the invitation to enroll in a coaching program.
