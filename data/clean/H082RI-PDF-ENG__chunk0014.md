often feel their ability to fully self-identify is denied in the context

of demographics forms. Speciﬁcally, participants cited situations in

which demographics forms ask them to identify their membership in

a racial group but allow them to only select one racial identity, rather

undergraduate students, Townsend and colleagues assigned one group

to complete a set of demographics questions that allowed them only

to select one racial identity and another group to complete a set of

questions that allowed them to select multiple racial identities. The

researchers found that multi-racial students assigned to the “check one”

condition reported lower self-esteem than those assigned to the “check

all that apply” condition. They also found that those students who were

only able to select one racial identity performed worse on a subsequent,
