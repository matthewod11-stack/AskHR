## The Connectionist, Subsymbolic, Hypothesis

From the dawn of the computer era, there had been two approaches to information processing by machines, serial processing and parallel processing. In a serial processing system, for example in home PCs and Apples, a single central

processing unit (CPU) processes the steps of a program one at a time, albeit very quickly. The ﬂow diagrams of information-processing psychology implicitly assumed that the human mind was a serial processor. Figure 6.3, for exam- ple, shows that multiple streams of input to sensory memory are reduced to a single stream by attention and pattern recog- nition. Likewise, the symbol-system hypothesis was predi- cated on a serial processing architecture, the human CPU executing one logical step at a time.

In parallel processing, multiple data streams are processed simultaneouslybymultipleprocessors.Inthemostinteresting of these systems, distributed cognition systems (Rumelhart, McClelland, & PDR Research Group, 1986), there are large numbers of weak processors, in contrast to serial systems’ single powerful processor.

Obviously, parallel-processing computers are potentially much more powerful than single CPU machines, but for a long time obstacles stood in the way of constructing them. Parallel machines are more physically complex than sequen- tial machines, and they are vastly more difﬁcult to program, since one must somehow coordinate the work of the multiple processors in order to avoid chaos. With regard to self- programming machines, there is the special difﬁculty of ﬁg- uring out how to get feedback information about the results of behavior to interior (“hidden”) units lying between input and output units. Since sequential machines were great suc- cesses very early on, and the power of the parallel archi- tecture seemed unnecessary, work on parallel-processing computers virtually ceased in the 1960s.

In the 1980s, however, developments in both computer science and psychology converged to revive the fortunes of parallel-processing architectures. Although serial processors continuedtogainspeed,designerswerepushingupagainstthe limitsofhowfastelectronscouldmovethroughsilicon.Atthe same time, computer scientists were tackling jobs demanding ever-greater computing speed, making a change to parallel processing desirable. For example, consider the problem of computer vision, which must be solved if effective robots are tobebuilt.Imagineacomputergraphicmadeupof256(cid:11)256 pixels. For a serial computer to recognize such an image, it wouldhavetocomputeoneatatimethevalueof256(cid:11)256(cid:2) 65,536 pixels, which might take more time than allowed for a response to occur. On the other hand, a parallel-processing computer containing 256 (cid:11) 256 interconnected processors canassignonetocomputethevalueofasinglepixelandsocan process the graphic in a tiny fraction of a second.

In psychology, continued failings of the symbolic para- digm made parallel, connectionist processing an attractive alternative to serial symbol systems. Two issues were espe- cially important for the new connectionists. First of all,
