## HBR / Digital Article / Research: When Help Isn’t Helpful

In our years of studying the helping process, we’ve discovered that

help at work is a paradox. Some aspects of organizational structure that

make help common enough to fuel creativity and learning also increase

the likelihood that unhelpful help will emerge. These structures are (1)

strong helping norms, (2) ﬂat hierarchies, and (3) ﬂexible roles.

Strong helping norms increase the likelihood that people will ask for

help when they need it, and others will agree to give it. Flat hierarchies

mean that people don’t worry as much about asking others for help

—even those experts who might be hard to approach in a steeper

hierarchy. Finally, when roles are ﬂuid and everyone feels responsible,

it’s hard to know who is responsible for what.
