# predictions.

Seen this way, neuroeconomics is likely to produce three types of findings: Evidence for rational-choice

processes; evidence supporting behavioral economics processes and parameters (as in Table 1); and evidence of

different types of constructs which do not fit easily into standard modeling categories.

17 However, as activities become automatic, they often become harder to remember and difficult to teach to others, an important fact for the division of labor in large firms where learning-by-doing creates automaticity.

Results consistent with rational choice: In choice domains where evolution has had a long time to

sculpt pan-species mechanisms that are crucial for survival (food, sex, and safety), neural circuits which

approximate Bayesian rational choice have probably emerged. For example, Platt and Glimcher (1999) find

neurons in monkey lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) which fire at a rate that is almost perfectly correlated with

the expected value of an upcoming juice reward, triggered by a monkey eye movement (saccade). Monkeys can

also learn to approximate mixed-strategies in games, probably using generalized EWA-type reinforcement

algorithms (Lee, McGreevy and Barraclough, 2005). Neuroscientists are also finding neurons that appear to

express values of choices (Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2005) and potential locations of “neural currency” that
