Positive Psychology is a current branch of psychology which stresses ordinary, successful advancement instead of the treatment of psychological sickness. The field promises to strengthen traditional psychology rather than replacing it as PS fundamentally focuses on what is “good” in the individual, positive traits, and strengthen them.

Martin Seligman is considered the father of Positive Psychology, although the term is coined to Abraham Maslow, 1951, and he concentrated on the individuals’ happiness, prosperity, well-being and how the individual’s mental state could be improved by focusing on these traits. Seligman successfully amalgamated thoughts an researchers, philosophers and scientists and related them to the consciousness. The concept of practical importance of positive psychology has been originated in late 90s in its cotemporary form. This took place when Martin Seligman as the president of American Psychological Association invigorated the necessity of i ncluding a strength-based approach to the field of Psychology [2].
