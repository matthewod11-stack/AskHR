# 156 PERSONALITY AND WORK

may inﬂuence the occurrence of CWBs is by initiating those be- haviors. We hypothesize that as an initiator of CWBs, personality traits exert both a direct line of causal inﬂuence and a more indi- rect line of inﬂuence by helping to shape the attitudes held toward the CWBs and a set of perceptual variables including perceived job stress, perceived injustice and dissatisfaction.

A second manner in which personality traits may inﬂuence the occurrence of CWBs is by moderating relationships between orga- nizational events and CWBs. As Figure 6.1 indicates, we hypothesize that speciﬁc personality traits moderate two sets of relationships. The ﬁrst is the relationship between organizational features (job characteristics, work group characteristics, or company policies) and a set of perceptual variables including perceived job stress, per- ceived injustice, or dissatisfaction. The second is the relationship between those perceptual variables and the counterproductive be- haviors themselves.

In this chapter, we point to evidence that personality may be linked to CWBs in all of these ways. We do not mean to suggest that a comprehensive explanatory model of these linkages is possible at this stage. Indeed, any attempt to explain the processes linking personality and CWBs is part of a larger and continuing effort within personality psychology itself to explain how personality and behavior are interconnected. In sum, we offer here a model that posits ﬁve mechanisms by which personality can affect CWBs:

- 1. Personality as a direct determinant of CWBs. We will posit lim- ited instances in which individuals are “hard-wired” by biological and neurochemical mechanisms to engage in counterproduc- tive behavior (impulsive behavior that bypasses cognitive as- sessment of appropriateness).

- 2. Personality as a determinant of attitudes toward counterpro- ductive behaviors, with such attitudes leading to various CWBs. 3. Personality as a determinant of a set of perceptual variables in- cluding workplace satisfaction, moods, stress, and injustice, with these perceptual variables leading to various CWBs.

- 4. Personality as a moderator of perceptions of environmental events (personality leads some to perceive as unjust organiza- tional events seen as just by others), with those perceptions leading to various CWBs.
