(Mean 5 4.19, SD: 0.914) and OCB (Mean 5 4.071, SD: 0.854). Significant correlations were found between inclusive leadership, organizational learning, IWB and OCB. The reported correlations were: inclusive leadership and IWB (r 5 0.390, p 5 0.000), inclusive leadership and OCB (r 5 0.463, p 5 0.000), inclusive leadership and organizational learning (r 5 0.450, p 5 0.000), organizational learning and IWB (r 5 0.361, p 5 0.000) and organizational learning and OCB (r 5 0.556, p 5 0.000). The results reveal that significant and positive relationships exist between the examined variables in this study.

Assessing the PLS-SEM model Factorloadingsweremeasuredtochecktheinternalconsistencyoftheitems.Table2showed that all items had a loading higher than 0.7 (Hair et al., 2016). Moreover, both the average variance extracted and the composite reliability were calculated for all constructs (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The values of the AVEs and CRs were higher than 0.5 and 0.7, respectively, following the assertions of Fornell and Larcker (1981). Based on these findings, the constructs in our hypothesized model were reliable and consistent. Discriminant validity was assessed, using the Fornell and Larcker (1981) technique. This technique includes calculating the square root of the average variance extracted and comparing it with associations between the examined variables. The results in Table 1 show that the discriminant validity was met, as all the square roots of the AVEs were greater than the correlations within the latent variables. In order to provide another evidence of the discriminant validity, the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) was calculated. Results in Table 3 indicated that HTMT ratios were smaller than 0.85, following the suggestions recommend by Hulland (1999). Therefore, we can say that discriminant validity condition wasmetinthisstudy.Finally,thepredictiverelevance(Stone–Geisser’sQ2)wasestimatedfor theresearchvariables.TheQ2valueswere(0.097)fororganizationallearning,(0.097)forIWB and (0.187) for OCB. The Stone–Geisser’s Q2 values were larger than 0, which suggests predictive relevance as recommended by Hair et al. (2016).

Assessing the structural model: quality criteria R2 and f2 values were calculated to assess the structural model. The calculated values of R2 were acceptable, following the recommendation of (Hair et al., 2019). Organizational learning hadR2valueof0.260,IWBhadR2valueof0.271andOCBhadR2valueof0.396.Accordingto Hair et al. (2019) values between 0.25 and 0.50 are considered moderate, while values between 0.50 and 0.75 are considered substantial. Hair et al. (2019) suggested as well that even less than10%orlowervalueoftheR2canbeconsideredsatisfactoryanddependsontheresearch context.

Moreover, the reported effect size f2 were: inclusive leadership on organizational learning (0.197), organizational learning on IWB (0.047), organizational learning on OCB (0.183), inclusive leadership on IWB (0.073) and inclusive leadership on OCB (0.083).

Hypotheses testing Figure 2 and Table 4 show the results of the direct and mediating effects. The results indicated that inclusive leadership exerted a positive impact on both OCB (β 5 0.269, p50.000)andIWB(β50.287,p50.001).Inclusiveleadershipwasalsofoundtobepositively relatedtoorganizationallearning(β50.449,p50.000).Organizationallearningwasfoundto exert a positive effect on OCB (β 5 0.436, p 5 0.000) and IWB (β 5 0.232, p 5 0.003). The results lend support for H1, H2, H3, H4, H5.

To test the mediating effect, the authors calculated the indirect effects using the 5000- bootstrappingmethod,followingthesuggestionsofHairetal.(2016).Theresultsshowedthat
