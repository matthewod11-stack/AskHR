## According to Asadi Someh & Shanks (2015), Big Data Analytics (BDA) significantly

improves the overall performance of companies, particularly in markets experiencing

growth. Wamba et al. (2017) investigated the relationship between BDA resources and

company performance. They found evidence that BDA is positively correlated with companiesâ€™

performance and this is especially true in markets that are currently expanding.

In the realm of big data, possessing a robust BDA empowers companies to uncover valuable

patterns, trends, and knowledge that can inform strategic decisions and innovative initiatives.

Wamba et al. (2017) suggest that by cultivating and harnessing BDA, companies can gain a

competitive edge that will last over time. This stems from the capacity to make well-informed,

data-driven decisions, swiftly adapt to changing market conditions, and proactively address

emerging challenges. The ability to leverage big data analytics effectively enables companies

to optimize their operations, enhance customer experiences, identify new market opportunities,

and craft targeted marketing strategies.
