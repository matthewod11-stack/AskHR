# The Modern Scientiﬁc Period 129

traditional AI, while it had made advances on tasks humans ﬁnd intellectually taxing, such as chess playing, was persis- tently unable to get machines to perform the sorts of tasks that people do without the least thought, such as recognizing patterns. Perhaps most importantly to psychologists, the be- havior that they had most intensively studied for decades— learning—remained beyond the reach of programmed com- puters, and the development of parallel machines that could actually learn was quite exciting. That the brain could solve these problems while supercomputers could not suggested that the brain was not a serial machine.

The other shortcoming of symbolic AI that motivated the new connectionists was the plain fact that the brain is not a sequential computing device. If we regard neurons as small processors, then it becomes obvious that the brain is much more like a massively parallel processor than it is like a PC or an Apple. The brain contains thousands of interconnected neu- rons, all of which are working at the same time. As Rumelhart et al. (1986) announced, they aimed to replace the computer model in psychology with the brain model. The interconnected processors of connectionist models function like neurons: Each one is activated by input and then “ﬁres,” or produces output, depending on the summed strengths of its input. As- sembled properly, such a network will learn to respond in sta- ble ways to different inputs just as organisms do: Neural nets, as such processor assemblages are often called, learn.

Connectionism suggested a new strategy for explaining cognition. The symbol-system approach depends, as we have seen, on the idea that intelligence consists in the manipula- tion of symbols by formal computational rules. Like the symbol-system approach, connectionism is computational, because connectionists try to write computer models that emulate human behavior. But connectionist systems use very different rules and representations (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986; Smolensky, 1988): weighted mathematical connections be- tween neuronlike units rather that logical manipulation of symbols that map on to propositions.

Connectionist systems differ critically from symbolic systems at Marr’s implementation and algorithm levels. Analysis at the cognitive level is indifferent between the two architectures. However, at the implementation level, the nature of the hardware (or wetware, in the case of the brain) becomes crucial, because the implementation consists in executing a program with a real machine or real person, and different computers implement the same cognitive task in different ways. One of the two main issues that separate the symbol-system architecture of cognition from its connec- tionist rival concerns whether or not psychological theories of learning and cognition need be concerned with the imple- mentation level. According to the symbol-system view, the
