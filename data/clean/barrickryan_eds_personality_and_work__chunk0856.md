## New Directions: Types of Relationships and Roles for Personality Variables

Although many, if not most, of our models portray personality vari- ables as having main effects, personality variables have moderator, mediator, suppressor, and interaction effects as well. Moreover, the direction (positive, negative) and form (linear, curvilinear, con- Ô¨Ågural) vary depending on a variety of variables. For example, re- search on the determinants of team performance indicates that a relationship between a personality variable and an outcome vari- able may be curvilinear in one situation and linear in another, as in creative problem-solving tasks versus compensatory tasks (Barry & Stewart, 1997; Barrick et al., 1998). Moreover, interpersonal in- teraction can affect outcomes. For example, personality charac- teristics of team members can interact with those of the leader to determine team performance (LePine et al., 1997). Team-based and customer service work settings are interpersonal in nature and are thus dynamic within short episodes of interactions as well as over time. The form and type of relationships between personality variables and outcome measures are thus also likely to change over time. These are but a few examples of the complex nature of the type, form, and direction of relationships of personality variables with other variables in our models.
