But while this “conflict-free utopia” might feelgood — at least in the short-term — it doesn’t always lead to thebest results. In fact, the absence of productive conflict leads towhat Patrick Lencioni, author of the

Five Dysfunctions of a Team,calls “artificial harmony,” where people act as if everything is fineon the team but, in reality, there are unspoken ideas, unvoiceddisagreements, and even simmering resentments.

Research shows that teams where people feel safe to disagreeactually outperform other teams. They make better decisions.And the friction that accompanies disagreement — even ifunpleasant at times — allows for creativity and growth.At the same time, there is a difference between healthy andunhealthy conflicts, and what Sam was dealing with certainlytended toward the latter. Healthy team conflict moves a teamtowards its goals and builds productive, respectful, and trustingrelationships. Unproductive conflict, on the other hand, holds ateam back.
