# Reasons for Automating Study Results

OPM wanted to provide line managers, HR professionals, and employees with immediate access to occupational information. With ad- vances in technology, it became possible to place this information in easy-to-use systems, ensuring that it is used for daily HR opera- tional purposes as well as other programmatic initiatives. With the assistance of HR profes- sionals within the federal government, OPM designed two automated occupational data delivery systems, the Human Resource Man- ager (HR Manager), designed for use by HR professionals and line managers, and USACareers (originally called Career Counse- lor), designed as a career development tool for use by employees. These systems not only pro- vide the results of the occupational analyses but also useful applications of the data. In addition, they place the same competency in- formation in the hands of managers and em- ployees, building a foundation for clearer com- munication of occupational expectations and career progression.
