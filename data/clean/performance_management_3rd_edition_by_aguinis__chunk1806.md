## Characteristics of Legally Sound Performance Management Systems

Performance dimensions and standards are clearly defined and explained to the employee, are job related, and are within the control of the employee. Procedures are standardized and uniform for all employees within a job group. The system is formally explained and communicated to all employees.

Employees are given timely information on performance deficiencies and opportunities to correct them. Employees are given a voice in the review process and are treated with courtesy and civility throughout the process. The system includes a formal appeals process. Performance information is gathered from multiple, diverse, and unbiased raters. Supervisors are provided with formal training and information on how to manage the performance of their employees. The system includes thorough and consistent documentation, including specific examples of performance based on firsthand knowledge. The system includes procedures to detect potentially discriminatory effects or biases and abuses in the system.

in Table 10.4. What was their conclusion? They found that systems that emphasized the measurement of job-related performance dimensions, provided written instructions to raters, and allowed employees to review appraisal results were more likely to withstand legal challenge. Overall, these researchers concluded that the employees’ perceptions of whether the system was fair and whether they were given due process were the most salient issues considered by the courts. This conclusion reinforces the recommendation offered throughout this course: to allow employees to participate in the design and implementation of the system because employee participation leads to the design of systems viewed as fair.
