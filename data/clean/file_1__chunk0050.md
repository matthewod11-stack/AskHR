(Corporate Gender Gap Report, 2010). In the majority of the Finnish business companies (54%), only 10% of senior management positions are held by female employees (Corporate Gender Gap Report, 2010). This leads to a conclusion that women continue to dominate numerically only on the lowest and middle levels of the organizational hierarchies in Finnish companies. The respondents of this survey consider masculine/patriarchal corporate culture, lack of role models, and lack of company leadership commitment to diversity as the main explanations for the womenâ€™s absence in the positions of senior leadership (Corporate Gender Gap Report, 2010: 47).

Gender pay differences are another key issue in this thesis. According to Eurostat (2008), in 2008, women earned on average 18 % less gross and per hour than men in the EU. As shown in Figure 2, Estonia (30%) and the Czech Republic (26%) were the worst offenders, while Italy (5%) and Slovenia (9%) had the smallest differences. The unadjusted gender pay difference, which is defined as the difference between average gross hourly earnings of men paid employees and of women paid employees, was around 20 % in Finland (Eurostat, 2008).
