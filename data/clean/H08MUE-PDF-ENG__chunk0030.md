## ambitions, strengths, weaknesses, and the interpersonal dynamics

between them. In a remote setting, this contact becomes virtual and

less frequent and these signals diminish.

To combat this, leaders need to intentionally and consciously talk to

their people, listen to them, and devise ways to help them succeed.

Be proactive about reaching out if you have even a minor question or

concern, don’t cancel your one-on-one meetings, and take advantage of

moments just before a virtual meeting begins or after it ends to foster

connection and hear what’s going on. Most importantly, don’t limit

the interaction to work issues. Be deliberate about ﬁnding out what’s

happening in their community or in their lives.

This kind of intensive listening, however, doesn’t come naturally to

everyone, and may be quite diﬃcult for some managers. But without it,

managing remotely may not work.
