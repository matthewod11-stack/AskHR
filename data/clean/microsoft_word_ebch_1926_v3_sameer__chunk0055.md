level ones like self-esteem and self-actualization. Employers may be able to increase employee motivation by fulfilling these demands at work.

Herzberg's Two-Factor idea, which distinguishes between motivators and hygiene factors (factors that, when absent, might demotivate people), is another significant idea. Organisations can increase intrinsic motivation among their staff by concentrating on motivators like success and recognition. According to the equity theory, employees assess their working conditions by comparing their contributions (effort, talents) and results (compensation, recognition) to those of their peers. When people feel unfairly treated, their motivation may diminish. Therefore, keeping employee motivation depends on making sure compensation schemes are fair. The Self- Determination Theory also emphasises the significance of relatedness, competence, and autonomy in motivating people. Employees' intrinsic motivation can be boosted by giving them some degree of control over their work, supporting their skill development, and encouraging strong interpersonal interactions. Finally, theories of work motivation offer insightful understandings into the complexity of human behaviour in the workplace. Understanding and putting these theories into practise can assist businesses in developing work environments that support and sustain employee motivation, which will ultimately result in higher job satisfaction and performance, which will be advantageous to both individuals and the business as a whole.
