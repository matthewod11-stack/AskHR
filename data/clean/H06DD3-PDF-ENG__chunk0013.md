But should be appealing is the elephant in the room. The main impediment

to talent mobility is almost always the manager. Our research found that

half of companies (and 74% of low performers) reported that managers’

failure to encourage movement was their top obstacle to mobility.

Managers are so careful to hold on to the stars on their teams that they

often play games to keep them. We’ve probably all heard stories about

managers who intentionally keep their top performers in the shadows so

no one discovers them.

It’s hard to blame them for that. In fact, most companies incentivize them

to do that. When managers are having success in metrics the organization

recognizes and rewards — typically pure business metrics — they want to

keep the talent that made them successful. If you’ve ever managed people,

you are likely guilty of this.
