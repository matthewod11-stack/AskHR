## 4.4 Elements to Evolution of People Analytics

There are four elements that Fitz-Enz and II Mattox (2014) believe will shape the emerging

the Finance field, which include Business standards and the assessment of an organization's

organizations to gather and report data related to talent development within the realm of Human

Resources. It outlines principles and guidelines for reporting metrics that are essential for

understanding and managing the development of an organization's workforce. This

performance against industry standards or best practices. This, in turn, facilitates a more

comprehensive understanding of where an organization stands in terms of talent development.

The second element authors emphasize is Mathematics or more accurately the significance of

modeling, particularly in the context of understanding seemingly chaotic situations, such as

those found in organizational processes like the recruiting cycle. The author draws inspiration

from James Gleick's perspective on mathematics, asserting that modeling is essential for

accurately defining a situation. According to Gleick, the primary objective of mathematics is

to unveil the intricate structures concealed within seemingly disorderly streams of data.

The author argues that the scientific exploration of chaotic processes aims to uncover and

define the underlying patterns. Once these patterns or structures are identified, they can be

explained. This explanatory step is deemed crucial for any system, including the recruitment
