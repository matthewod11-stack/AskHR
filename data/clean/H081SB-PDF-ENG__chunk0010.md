employees who add the most value to their organizations.

There are a few reasons for this eﬀect. On the one hand, when high

performers feel that their eﬀorts are under-rewarded, it reduces their

motivation, making them less excited about their jobs and more likely

to start looking elsewhere. This is often compounded by downstream

eﬀects, as other employees’ motivation also suﬀers when they see their

team members become demotivated.

There’s also a phenomenon psychologists call the “sucker eﬀect.”

Similar to FOMO, or fear of missing out, the sucker eﬀect refers to

employees’ fear of being a “sucker,” or of doing more than their fair

share and missing out on better opportunities. Interestingly, even

employees who aren’t actively looking for a new job may become more

aware of shifting market prices when a new hire joins at a higher salary,

sparking concerns that they may be being taken advantage of.

Our ﬁndings suggest that even in organizations with limited pay

transparency (i.e., in which existing employees may not know how
