better and more sensitive, and how we can actually call each other into

account about some of these things. Things that were acceptable 10, 20

years ago and no longer acceptable today, and that will continue over

time. And so I think each of these movements, there’s two steps forward,

one step back, and then we keep moving forward towards more equality
