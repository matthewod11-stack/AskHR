## Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) as a Single-item Measure of Employee…

Although linking survey results to actual companies’ results and customers be- haviour is surely a good idea, there is a statement of Reichheld’s which can cause confusion:

[…] my colleagues and I looked for a correlation between survey responses and ac- tual behavior – repeat purchases, or recommendations to friends and peers – that would ultimately lead to profitable growth. Based on information from 4,000 con- sumers, we ranked a variety of survey questions according to their ability to predict this desirable behavior10.

Interestingly, that actual recommendations to friends and peers was treated as a depend variable. It seems obvious that the question about the willingness of such a recommendation happened to be a good predictor of such behaviour. It is not a mistake. The same information was later repeated in the Reichheld’s ar- ticle: “The data allowed us to determine which survey questions had the strongest statistical correlation with repeat purchases or referrals”11. There was no infor- mation which of the output (repeated purchases or referrals) was more important. There is also no information about the correlation indicator.
