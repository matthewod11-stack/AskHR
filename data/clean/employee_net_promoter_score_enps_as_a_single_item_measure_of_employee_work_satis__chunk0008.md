# The scale

In the question that the NPS is based on (How likely is it that you would recom- mend X company to a friend or colleague?), an 11 point scale is used. The respond- ents mark their willingness of recommendation from 0 to 10, where 10 means “ex- tremely likely” to recommend, five means neutral, and 0 means “not at all likely”. Reichheld and his team noticed that the customers (or respondents) can be divid- ed into 3 groups. Based on that, he created a quite strict rule how to characterize them. Depending on the answer, the respondents were categorized as “promoters” in the case of those who answer 10 and 9, “passively satisfied” refers to those who marked 8 and 7 and those who chosen from 6 to 0 are called “detractors”. Taking only the 2 highest answers to describe “promoters” was in Reichheld’s opinion the solution for the tendency of people to give rather positive answers in such surveys. This decision however, leads to an asymmetry during the final score computation. The score of the eNPS indicator is counted as the percentage of promotes deducted by percentage of detractors. So theoretically the eNPS scores can be from –100% (only detractors) to +100% (only promoters).
