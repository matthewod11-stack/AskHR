## criteria, such as cost, technical issues, and proximity to users.

Innovations in energy pricing, using predictive analytics or pay-as-you-

go systems, are making energy access more aﬀordable and can help grow demand. While the energy-eﬃciency beneﬁts of open-source

models are still debatable, according to one analysis, DeepSeek requires

11 times less computing resources than a similar one from Meta.

According to the company, this corresponds to 10 to 40 times less

energy than similar U.S. models—and is thereby cheaper to run.

Such changes in the competitive playing ﬁeld and the energy saving

technologies available puts pressure on all AI companies to increase their energy eﬃciencies.

. . .

Compensating for these six divides is a business imperative, especially

at a moment when governments and regulators are less likely to step

in. This means company leaders—both AI producers and adopters—

must serve critical unmet need of users by pulling on alternative levers.

Fortunately, businesses have options to counter artiﬁcial inequality as

long as they focus on technologies, institutions, and markets.

AI acceleration does not have to translate into a more fragile, divided

world. Striking the right balance can facilitate AI’s wider adoption and

help realize its many revolutionary promises.
