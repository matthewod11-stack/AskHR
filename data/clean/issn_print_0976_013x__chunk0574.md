# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, all 8 hypotheses are accepted. There is no significant difference between all of

the OCTAPACE values and conformity of TCS and Infosys employees. Social conformity may

impede co-workers from understanding one another's personalities on the job (Turner, 1985).

Thus, diverse workplace norms support normative conformity in different ways, and

conformance positively or negatively impacts complex social networks. (Tang et al., 2013).

Also, there is an emergent need of a thorough and standardized explanation of the causes

and outcomes of social adherence in organizational contexts. Extant literature does not

conform whether employees with inherent values are involved in social conformance. No

research has yet uncovered a significant difference between OCTAPACE values and

conformance in two or more organizations. However, the conclusions of some of the prior

comparative studies claimed a strong association among OCTAPACE cultural values. All said,

the scope of this study is limited to Tata consulting services (TCS) and Infosys employees.

Hence, it is imperative that more research may be taken up to test the inferences based on
