## development, not a threat to relationships.

Giving feedback when you’re new to your role can feel like a mineﬁeld,

but it’s also an opportunity to establish your leadership foundation. By

assessing the landscape, fast-tracking trust, understanding your team’s

aspirations, and setting aside your ego, you can navigate this challenge

eﬀectively. In doing so, you’ll not only drive performance but also create

a team culture built on trust, candor, and mutual success—essential

ingredients for any leader’s legacy.
