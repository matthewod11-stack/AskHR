# ABSTRACT

Understanding employee satisfaction and engagement within a company

helps to implement practices that are adjusted to the organizational culture and

geared towards people-focused management. Collecting these perceptions correctly

and continuously usually requires time and knowledge of psychometrics. The eNPS

has therefore emerged as a metric capable of reflecting these aspects while

remaining objective and agile. The eNPS or Employee Net Promoter Score is a

metric that originated in marketing, adapted and incorporated by the human

resources area to measure the level of employee satisfaction and engagement. To

do this, it uses a single-question methodology: the recommendation of the company

as a good place to work to other people in their personal, social and professional

circles. This paper seeks to describe the practical application of this methodology in

a real company. To this end, it uses a case study, supported by an analysis of

documents provided by the company, an interview with the employee responsible for

applying eNPS in the company and a questionnaire with employees and leaders of

people who work there. The records found in the literature review, although scarce,

show the association found by the authors between the eNPS and the engagement

and job satisfaction constructs in real analysis, and the results found with the

empirical case study corroborate some of the findings in the research, suggesting

that the eNPS accomplishes what it sets out to do, adding simplicity as its main
