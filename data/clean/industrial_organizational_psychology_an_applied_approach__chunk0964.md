## Figure 4.6 Example of a direct mail recruitment advertisement

Direct-mail recruiting is especially useful for positions involving specialized skills. For example, Minor’s Landscape Services in Texas had difficulty finding licensed irrigators, so the company located a list of people in Texas who had irri- gation licenses and sent letters to each person on the list. The company found  qualified candidates and was able to fill both of its openings (Gruner, ). An example of direct-mail recruiting can be found in Figure ..
