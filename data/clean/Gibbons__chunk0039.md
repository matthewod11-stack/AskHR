### **[AI as metacognitive coach: the new collaboration model]{.underline}**

[When most people interact with AI, they ask for answers. But the real
power comes from asking AI to help you examine your questions. This
shifts AI from an oracle providing solutions to a coach developing your
thinking capabilities.]{.underline}

[At Wharton, professors Ethan and Lilach Mollick have pioneered this
approach in education. In their 2023 paper \"Assigning AI: Seven
Approaches for Students, with Prompts,\" they outline different ways to
use AI as a learning partner, including as a coach, mentor, and
simulator. These aren\'t just tools for getting homework done ---
they\'re methods for developing metacognitive skills.]{.underline}

[\"This metacognitive exercise can help you identify what you want to
explore and what you already understand,\" notes Stanford\'s Teaching
Commons in their guide on AI chatbots. \"Making connections to what you
already know can deepen your learning and support your
engagement.\"]{.underline}

[The Mollicks emphasize keeping humans \"in the loop,\" promoting active
oversight and critical assessment of AI outputs rather than passive
acceptance. This represents a fundamental shift from the tool paradigm.
You don\'t \"use\" a coach. You work with them to develop capabilities
that persist beyond individual sessions.]{.underline}
