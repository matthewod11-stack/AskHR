### **[Understanding the metacognitive advantage]{.underline}**

[Metacognition is essentially having a conversation with yourself about
your own thinking. It\'s the mental equivalent of watching yourself on
video --- suddenly you notice habits and patterns invisible in the
moment. Do you jump to conclusions? Overlook certain types of evidence?
Become overconfident when you have moderate expertise?]{.underline}

[Research by David Dunning and Justin Kruger published in 1999 famously
showed that people with the least competence tend to be most confident
--- they literally don\'t know enough to recognize their ignorance. In
their study, participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of
humor, grammar, and logic estimated themselves to be in the 62nd
percentile when they were actually in the 12th. The researchers
attributed this to a lack of metacognitive ability: incompetence robs
people of the capacity to realize they are incompetent.]{.underline}

[This is where AI becomes fascinating as a metacognitive partner. Unlike
human colleagues who might hesitate to challenge a senior expert, AI
systems have no social inhibitions. They can serve as what I call a
\"cognitive mirror\" --- reflecting your thinking patterns back to you
without judgment or hierarchy.]{.underline}
