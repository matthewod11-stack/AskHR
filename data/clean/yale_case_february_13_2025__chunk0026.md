# 14 EXPLORING EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS IN SEARCH FUND–ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

“freeing” event for the struggling employee. Leading with kindness and compassion can help facilitate the employee being on the same page as the manager, resulting in an optimized chance of amicable offboarding.

My most recent termination reflects this more evolved approach. The employee was aligned with Montis’s culture but struggled with performance. Rather than resorting to a sudden decision, I worked closely with the individual, offering support and regular feedback to try to get them back on track. Once we realized that was not working, we continued to explore the employee’s strengths and how they did not fit the criteria needed to be successful in the current role. We did not have a role that better suited their affinity match, so we helped the employee determine a better path for themselves and devoted time to finding a better-fitting person for the role. The employee eventually transitioned to a new company and position with Montis’s full endorsement, even expressing gratitude for the support during the process.

I do a lot of executive and conscious leadership coaching, which has made me a significantly better leader and CEO. Offboarding is a very challenging, but important, part of the CEO role, particularly in a growing company. While offboarding is never an enjoyable process, if led with empathy and compassion, it can be mutually beneficial and be effectuated with both sides feeling good at the end of the day.
