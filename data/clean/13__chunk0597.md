# (a) Psychological problems.

Several studies have shown that culture inﬂuences individuals’ reactions to mental illness and other psychological problems (e.g., Angermeyer, Buyantugs, Kenzine, & Matschinger, 2004; Crystal, Watanabe, & Chin, 1997; Dijker & Koomen, 2003; Papadopoulos, Leavey, & Vincent, 2002; Weiss, Jadhav, Raguram, Vounatsou, & Littlewood, 2001; Whaley, 1997). Angermeyer et al. (2004) showed, for example, that the relation between labeling a person with schizophrenia as mentally ill and the fear evoked by the person was stronger among individuals from Germany than people from Russia or Mongolia. Research by Crystal et al. (1997) was concerned with intolerance to targets who were viewed as different from the observers (i.e., students in the U.S., China, and Japan). The focus was on liking them as a friend or coworker on a class project. They found that Chinese students were more intolerant of (i.e., were repulsed by) having a child with signs of psychological withdrawal as a friend than were Japanese children. Moreover, research by Whaley (1997) showed that (a) relative to white respondents, both Hispanic and Asian respondents viewed mental patients as more dangerous, and (b) whereas among the white respondents, increased contact with such patients resulted in lower levels of perceived danger, the same was not true of black respondents.
