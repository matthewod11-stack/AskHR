during oﬃce hours every month will reduce the burden of scheduling,

and multiple mentees can meet with you at the same time. Such group

meetings also allow mentees to learn from each other and help them

make additional networking relationships.

You can also use technology to your advantage by recording videos of

your answers to frequently asked questions. Sending these videos out

prior to oﬃce hours increases the depth of conversations and serves as

an initial test of commitment. Posting this content on your website or

social media expands your reach.
