# Cognitive Processes

Arelatedpositionisthatofcognitivetheorists(e.g.,Anderson, 1983; G. A. Miller, Galanter, & Pribram, 1960; Newell & Simon, 1972), who seek to understand intelligence in terms of the processes of human thought and also the architecture that holds together these processes. These theorists may use the software of a computer as a model of the human mind, or in more recent theorizing, use the massively parallel operating systems of neural circuitry as a model (e.g., Rumelhart, McClelland, & PDPResearch Group, 1986). Much of the his- tory of this ﬁeld is relatively recent, simply because much of the “early” development of the ﬁeld has occurred in recent times.The ﬁeld today, for example, has advanced quite far be- yond where it was 30 years ago.At the same time, the origins of the ﬁeld go back to early in the twentieth century and even further, depending upon how broad one is in labeling work as related to this approach.
