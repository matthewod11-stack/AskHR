# toward heuristics than Piaget believed (Gigerenzer, Todd, & ABC Research Group, 1999).

Vygotsky’s theory is, at the turn of the century, more in vogue than Piaget’s. It better recognizes the important role of the social-cultural environment in intellectual development. And it also suggests how conventional tests may fail to un- earth developing intellectual functions that give children added potential to succeed intellectually. Vygotsky’s theory is rather vague, however, and much of the recent development has gone considerably beyond anything Vygotsky proposed. Perhaps if Vygotsky had not died tragically at an early age (38), he would have extensively ampliﬁed on his theory.
