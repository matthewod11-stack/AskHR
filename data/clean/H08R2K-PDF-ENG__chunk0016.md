# Risk Mitigation

Additionally, 12% of employees in our study admitted to making

mistakes, missing deadlines, or cutting corners in ways that could

jeopardize regulatory compliance—and employees under high stress are

11 times more likely to do so. The ﬁnancial penalties for non-compliance

can be devastating, and we believe that what might be even harder to

recover is the loss of stakeholder trust and reputational damage that

stress-driven failures can create.
