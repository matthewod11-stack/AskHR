# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

In her bestselling novel, Elizabeth Gilbert wrote that in order to succeed, everybody needs a teacher, a Guru, to guide him on his path and also a safe place from which to practice. My Guru is Ingmar Björkman. My safe place is Hanken School of Economics, Department of Management and Organization. If I did not meet my supervisor, Ingmar Björkman, you, my dear reader, would not hold this book in your hands. I thus would first like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor and Excellent Person, Ingmar Björkman. You are the first person I have met who possesses such contradictory features as hardwork, inexhaustible amount of positive energy, talent, intelligence, and friendliness. I will always remember you and admire your personality. I also want to thank Hanken School of Economics for giving me a chance to be a part of the school and to enjoy every single day I spent there.

I would like to extend my gratitude to my pre-examiners Professor Iiris Aaltio and Dr Anna Stafsudd for their very valuable comments. I am especially thankful to Professor Iiris Aaltio for acting as my opponent.

Professor Jeff Hearn deserves a special mention for his encouraging and supportive supervision. Thank you for providing me with all the scientific books and articles which provoked, slowed, and dramatically enriched my PhD process. I would like to extend my gratitude to my co-supervisor, Professor Liisa Husu, who encouraged and supported me in contacting the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and Statistics Finland for obtaining the Gender Equality Barometer data. Liisa Husu also did a great job in introducing me to the world of the Finnish gender system and its history. I also want to express my deep gratitude to Susanna Taimitarha, who had the patience to reflect upon my questions concerning statistical methodology, even when I could not formulate the proper questions to analyze my data.

I am grateful for the financing provided to me during my doctoral studies by Hanken Foundation, Department of Management and Organization, Marcus Wallenberg Foundation, and Liikesivistysrahasto Foundation.

My sincere gratitude goes to the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health as well as to Statistics Finland. Thank you so much for trusting me with your invaluable data called Gender Equality Barometer 2008. The fact that you granted such a confidential data set to a foreigner (now a Finn) radically raised the status of Finland in my eyes and also considerably increased my self-confidence.

I would also like to thank the editors of the journal 'Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal', Regine Bendl and Mustafa Özbilgin, for permission to reproduce parts of the paper "Gender pay gap and its perceptions", published in Volume 30, 2011, of the journal, as well as the anonymous journal reviewers for their helpful comments on an earlier version of that paper.
