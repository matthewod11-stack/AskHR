## When a feedback instrument surveys eight colleagues about your

business acumen, your score of 3.79 is far greater a distortion than if it

simply surveyed one person about you—the 3.79 number is all noise, no

signal. Given that (a) we’re starting to see more of this sort of data-based

feedback, (b) this data on you will likely be kept by your company for a

very long time, and (c) it will be used to pay, promote, train, and deploy

or ﬁre you, you should be worried about just how fundamentally ﬂawed

it really is.

The only realm in which humans are an unimpeachable source of truth

is that of their own feelings and experiences. Doctors have long known

this. When they check up on you post-op, they’ll ask, “On a scale of one

to 10, with 10 being high, how would you rate your pain?” And if you

say, “Five,” the doctor may then prescribe all manner of treatments, but

what she’s unlikely to do is challenge you on your “ﬁve.” It doesn’t make

sense, no matter how many operations she has done, to tell you your

“ﬁve” is wrong, and that, actually, this morning your pain is a “three.” It

doesn’t make sense to try to parse what you mean by “ﬁve,” and whether

any cultural diﬀerences might indicate that your “ﬁve” is not, in fact, a

real “ﬁve.” It doesn’t make sense to hold calibration sessions with other

doctors to ensure that your “ﬁve” is the same as the other “ﬁves” in the

rooms down the hall. Instead, she can be conﬁdent that you are the best

judge of your pain and that all she can know for sure is that you will be

feeling better when you rate your pain lower. Your rating is yours, not
