# HBR / Digital Article / The Workplace Psychological Contract Is Broken. Here’s How to…

Taking a care lens invites organizations to develop a policy as a guiding

principle and be transparent about it (while also being ready to adapt).

For instance, the HR director of one of the European oﬃces of an

international consultancy told us that while they have a hybrid option

for all, young graduates have to be fully on-site for their ﬁrst six months.

She explained that these new hires do not complain, because they

are told about it from the start—something missing in cases such as

Amazon and Dell, where employees’ expectations had been set during

Covid and the explanations for bringing them back to the oﬃce were

only given afterward—and the new hires at the consultancy know it is

only for a six-month period. “It’s essential to be clear about not only the

policies but also the rationale explaining them,” the HR director said.

“It’s important to justify your decisions. You can’t just impose things with no explanation.” To be most eﬀective, these explanations need to

address what matters as well as what is right and what works.
