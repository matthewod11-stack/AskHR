# Outcomes Experienced by Allies

In addition to allies positively impacting others individually as well as influencing the general culture, there are many ways being an ally affects oneself directly. First, many allies report feeling better about themselves because of being an ally. This was extensively discussed in Rostosky et al.’s (2015) qualitative study, in which allies consistently discussed the feeling of growth and how much they learned about themselves because of their status as an ally. Much of this growth and development leads to feelings of personal meaning and integrity for their work as allies (Smith & Redington, 2010). Grzanka et al. (2015) also highlighted the fact that being an ally just feels good (especially when being appreciated by others).

Allies also consistently report positive changes in their relationships with others due to being an ally. Duhigg, Rostosky, Gray, and Wimsatt (2010) interviewed allies about their experiences; this qualitative study as well as Rostosky et al.’s (2015) yielded two consistent themes. First, allies reported making friendships and stronger personal connections with others due to their status as an ally. Being an ally exposes a person more deeply to a new community they may not have met
