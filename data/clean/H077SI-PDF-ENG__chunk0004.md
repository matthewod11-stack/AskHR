or putting in extra hours. They say “no” to requests to go beyond what

they think should be expected of a person in their position.

In reality, quiet quitting is a new name for an old behavior. Our

researchers have been conducting 360-degree leadership assessments

for decades, and we’ve regularly asked people to rate whether their

“work environment is a place where people want to go the extra mile.”

To better understand the current phenomenon of quiet quitting, we

looked at our data to try to answer this question: What makes the

diﬀerence for those who view work as a day prison and others who feel

that it gives them meaning and purpose?

Our data indicates that quiet quitting is usually less about an

employee’s willingness to work harder and more creatively, and more

about a manager’s ability to build a relationship with their employees

where they are not counting the minutes until quitting time.
