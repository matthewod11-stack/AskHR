Thus the path to the next level is blocked, and the employee becomes frustrated and places more importance on the previous level. Perhaps that is why some unions demand more money and benefits for their members rather than job enrichment.

This idea has received at least some empirical support (Hall & Nougaim, ; Salancik & Pfeffer, ). Two-Factor Theory As shown in Tables . and ., Herzberg () believed that job-related fac- tors could be divided into two categories—hygiene factors and motivators—thus the name two-factor theory.
