The greatest strength of cultural approaches is their recogni- tion that intelligence cannot be understood fully outside its cultural context. Indeed, however common may be the thought processes that underlie intelligent thinking, the be- haviors that are labeled as intelligent by a given culture cer- tainly vary from one place to another, as well as from one epoch to another.

The greatest weakness of cultural approaches is their vagueness. They tend to say more about the context of intel- ligent behavior than they do about the causes of such behav- ior. Intelligence probably always will have to be understood at many different levels, and any one level in itself will be in- adequate. It is for this reason, presumably, that systems mod- els have become particularly popular in recent years. These models attempt to provide an understanding of intelligence at multiple levels.
