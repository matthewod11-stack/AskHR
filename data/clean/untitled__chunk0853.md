# CULTURE AND SOCIETY

A rather different position has been taken by more anthropo- logically oriented investigators. Modern investigators trace their work back at the very least to the work of Kroeber and Kluckhohn (1952), who studied culture as patterns of behav- ior acquired and transmitted by symbols. Much of the work in this approach, like that in the cognitive approach, is relatively recent.

The most extreme position is one of radical cultural rela- tivism, proposed by Berry (1974), which rejects assumed psychological universals across cultural systems and requires the generation from within each cultural system of any be- havioral concepts to be applied to it (the so-called emic ap- proach). According to this viewpoint, therefore, intelligence can be understood only from within a culture, not in terms of views imposed from outside that culture (the so-called etic approach). Even in present times, psychologists have argued that the imposition of Western theories or tests on non- Western cultures can result in seriously erroneous conclu- sions about the capabilities of individuals within those cultures (Greenﬁeld, 1997; R. J. Sternberg et al., 2000).

Other theorists have taken a less extreme view. For exam- ple, Michael Cole and his colleagues in the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (1982) argued that the radi- cal position does not take into account the fact that cultures interact. Cole and his colleagues believe that a kind of condi- tional comparativism is important, so long as one is careful in setting the conditions of the comparison.

Cole and his colleagues gave as an example a study done by Super (1976). Super found evidence that African infants sit and walk earlier than do their counterparts in the United

States and Europe. But does such a ﬁnding mean that African infants are better walkers, in much the same way that North American psychologists have concluded that American children are better thinkers than African children (e.g., Herrnstein & Murray, 1994)? On the contrary, Super found that mothers in the culture he studied made a self-conscious effort to teach babies to sit and walk as early as possible. He concluded that the African infants are more advanced be- cause they are speciﬁcally taught to sit and walk earlier and are encouraged through the provision of opportunities to practice these behaviors. Other motor behaviors were not more advanced. For example, infants found to sit and walk early were actually found to crawl later than did infants in the United States.
