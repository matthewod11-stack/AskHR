When adopting safety as a strategic goal, however, managers should

avoid making it a stand-alone initiative. Doing so will only serve to

divorce it from the core business strategy. In our experience, when

burden, not an integral part of their job or the company’s strategy, and

resources are cut at the ﬁrst sign of ﬁnancial pressure.
