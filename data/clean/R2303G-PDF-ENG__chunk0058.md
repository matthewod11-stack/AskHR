## spend time “down on the dance ﬂoor” and “up in the balcony.”

Two of the aspiring CEOs in our study used the strategy of regular

reﬂection very eﬀectively. One spent her 20-minute ride to work every

morning thinking about the interactions of the previous day and

deﬁning one learning intention for the day. The second blocked out

a regular time in his week to reﬂect on his successes, failures, and

challenges as a leader. He also used that time to seek feedback from

his colleagues, often by asking them such questions as “What did you

see me do/hear me say?” and “What would you like to see me do/hear

me say?”

Learning requires you to recognize the patterns you fall into. Kevin

identiﬁed his by writing in a journal about the many situations in

which he could have been more appreciative and less hard-charging

with colleagues. Later he would analyze those situations in detail—

and visualize other ways of responding. A coach helped him recognize

that his abrasive self often emerged when he felt impatient, so they

developed a plan: Whenever he sensed his impatience rising, he would

press each ﬁngertip with his thumb before responding. Just creating

that small space between stimulus and response helped him react as he

intended.
