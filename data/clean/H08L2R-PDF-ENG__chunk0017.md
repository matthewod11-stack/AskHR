# steps of the human–AI conversation.

Executives in many roles have spoken about using gen AI as a co-

thinker. Masayoshi Son of Softbank has said, “I am chatting with

ChatGPT every day,” brainstorming new ideas and business strategies.

Jeﬀ Maggioncalda of Coursera called gen AI “an incredible thought

partner changing the way I do my job.”

Outside the C-suite, we met managers at all levels who embrace co-

thinking. Valentin Marguet, a project manager at Ferrari, shared that

“For technical problem-solving, generative AI can act as a co-thinking

partner, serving as a methodological expert while guiding structured

thought processes to systematically explore root causes.” We believe

that these approaches can help any leader or manager and that the time

to start is now.
