As Molly Dickens, co-founder of the nonproﬁt &Mother, told me, “The

new legislation has created a fork in the road for organizations. Will

you take the path of basic compliance and fade into the average? Or

will you take the path that builds on this moment? Even if this means

baby steps on that path — articulating a commitment to actively listen

to where other weaknesses lie with the intention of raising the whole

organizational bar — speaks volumes.”

New laws protecting pregnant and pumping employees were long

overdue, and are now the standard. Taking organizational ownership

of the quality and ease of the pumping experience at work (including

business travel) signals an elevated level of commitment and care for

nursing employees returning to work. Word gets around — and even

more so if you amplify the commitments made as a point of pride

and with intention. What one can expect at the intersection of parent

and professional is a central theme in recruitment, retention, and

yes, reputation. Proceed with the authentic goal of delivering the best

experience possible for your working parents. The proof will be in the

pride even the simplest shifts will bring to their lives.
