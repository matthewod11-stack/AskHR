## Determining Whether an Employment Decision Is Legal

At first glance, the legal aspects of making employment decisions seem compli- cated. After all, there are many laws and court cases that apply to employment decisions. The basic legal aspects, however, are not that complicated. Use the flow chart in Figure . to make the process easier to understand as each stage is discussed.

Does the Employment Practice Directly Refer to a Member of a Federally Protected Class?

An employment practice is any decision that affects an employee. Employment practices include hiring, training, firing, promoting, assigning employees to shifts, determining pay, disciplining, and scheduling vacations. Thus, any deci- sion made by an employer has the potential for legal challenge.

The first step in determining the legality of an employment practice is to decide whether the practice directly refers to a member of a protected class. A protected class is any group of people for which protective legislation has been passed. A federally protected class is any group of individuals specifically protected by fed- eral law. A list of U.S. federally protected classes is shown in Figure .. Table . shows the similarity of protected classes in the United States and in selected other countries. In Canada, there are no federally protected classes; each province makes its own employment law. Thus, the protected classes listed for Canada in Table . are those protected by law in all provinces and territories. A complete list of pro- vincially protected classes can be found in the appendix at the end of this chapter.

Though one would assume that few employers in the twenty-first century would intentionally make employment decisions on the basis of a person’s sex, race, national origin, color, age, religion, or disability, there are hundreds of orga- nizations each year that do exactly that. For example, in , Rent-A-Center set- tled a sex discrimination case for $ million after its chief executive officer and other managers discriminated against women. Some of their quotes included, “Get rid of women any way you can,” “In case you didn’t notice, we do not employ women,” and “The day I hire a woman will be a cold day in hell.”
