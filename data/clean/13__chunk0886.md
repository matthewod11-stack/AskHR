As one might expect, Cleese’s videos are infused with considerable humor, and he maintains that ‘‘humor in training increases retention and decreases anxiety,’’ (Lundberg, 2006). Indeed, a quick scan of the internet reveals that many trainers, speakers, and other practitioners insist that humor has enormous potential for improving communication with the audience, audience participation and receptivity to new ideas, learning, and information retention. Certainly, if such claims are valid, an important role for researchers would be to explicate the speciﬁc mechanisms by which humor can have such effects, so that guidance about the use of humor could be given to trainers and other practitioners (see Kaupins, 1991, for an initial venture into this topic).

Nevertheless, corroborating evidence for humor’s important role comes from other domains. For example, therapists and researchers studying therapeutic effects have recognized for decades that humor has great potential to
