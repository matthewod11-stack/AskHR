## Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine 2018 report. Start by

checking in with the target of this behavior when you witness it. This

validates her experience. For example, I noticed that your manager

dismissed you and the other women’s expertise in the meeting. It feels

sexist to me. Am I reading this right?

Check your own impulse to gaslight.

The next time a woman colleague reports a sexist or harassing

encounter, be sure that nothing you say might lead her to believe she’s

misreading the perpetrator’s behavior or blowing it out of proportion.

Try something like: I believe you. From what you’ve described, that

behavior doesn’t sound appropriate. Can you tell me more, and can I team

up with you to address it? These responses oﬀer support while allowing

you to gather more information about the occurrence.

Hold other men accountable.
