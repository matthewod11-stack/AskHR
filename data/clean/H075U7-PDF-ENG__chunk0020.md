## Active confrontation of other men for sexism, bias, harassment, and

all manner of inappropriate behavior may be the toughest part of male

allyship. But it is essential to eliminating the “good guy” defense. Don’t

tell the target of harassment or misogyny that the perpetrator is a “good

guy.” Address the behavior with the man in question. We call this the

carefrontation, contextualizing confrontation as an act of caring on the

part of a friend or colleague. Try: That comment was inappropriate and

demeaning. I found it offensive and it was clearly offensive to our women

colleagues. I know you can do better. Alternatively, you could say, You

and I go way back and we’re friends. I heard what you said/what you did.

We don’t do that here. You need to make amends and be more respectful.
