Data: Quantitative questionnaire data from the personnel of two Finnish universities. N = 455 employees.

In this study we contribute to the organizational justice literature by integrating social comparison theory (Festinger, 1957) and the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999) into an analysis of differences by gender in reactions to the organizational injustice. We also contribute to the gender literature by seeking explanations for why even though female employees tend to earn less than their comparable male counterparts, they continue to be committed to their organizations to the same or even greater extent than their male colleagues (Clark, 1997; Crosby, 1982; Jackson and Grabski, 1988).

The empirical analysis of the article reveals that men’s organizational commitment is more strongly affected by pay inequity than women’s. This difference is in part explained by pay comparison and access to pay information. Pay comparison refers to external and internal targets, where internal targets refer to a comparison with a similar one inside of the organization, and external targets refer to a comparison with a similar one in a different organization (e.g. Greenberg, 1990; Sweeney and McFarlin, 2004). This finding suggests that female employees are socialized to be more sensitive towards organizational procedures and systems than towards pay itself. Following the gender socialization perspective, female employees are found to be less likely to know about some of pay and related issues. Alternatively, female employees are proposed to be more likely to rely on procedures and systems in order to gain organizational outcomes due to a history of discrimination and gender-role stereotyping (Sweeney and McFarlin, 1997).
