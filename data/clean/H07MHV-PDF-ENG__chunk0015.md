# through words.

Visual thinkers like me process information diﬀerently; we use hands-

on problem solving and visual perception. I often point to a moment at

the beginning of my career when my visual orientation aided in solving

some behavioral issues in cattle. The animals had suddenly halted and

refused to move forward, causing work delays and compromising proﬁt

margins. Handlers hadn’t been able to ﬁgure out what was causing

the cattle’s behavior, and they were using extreme methods, such as

prodding and bullhorns, to keep the animals in line.
