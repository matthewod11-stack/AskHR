## dynamics between spouses, and many other factors.

One result might be an arms race in which consumer protection and exploitation both increase. For

example, in the recent rise of obesity among Americans, industries selling cheap caloric food (such as pizzas

with cheese inside the crust) have flourished. But healthier food, diet books, personal training, plastic surgery,

and eating disorders have flourished too.

A simple example of how to analyze the impact of consumer rationality on markets is Gabaix and

Laibson (2006)’s model of products with “add-ons”. Add-ons are typically marginal goods or services whose

prices can be easily hidden or “shrouded” (like bank transaction fees or the cost of printer ink cartridges). If

enough consumers don’t think about the shrouded add-on price, then in a competitive market firms will

compete by offering very low prices on base goods (below marginal cost) and will charge high markups on add-

ons. Sophisticated consumers who know the add-on price, but can cheaply substitute away from the add-ons

(avoiding bank ATM fees, for example) will prefer products with expensive add-ons, because they benefit from

the low base-good price produced by competition. (The myopic consumers who don’t think about the add-on

cost are subsidizing the sophisticated consumers.) As a result, competition does not theoretically lead to

revealing the add-on price, because a firm that reveals its add-ons will not attract either myopic consumers (who

will mistakenly think the price-revealing firm is too expensive) or sophisticates (who benefit from the below-

cost base-good price). This paper is a good example of why careful analysis is needed to be able to make sharp

conclusions about whether markets will erase or exploit limits on consumer rationality. Two other examples are

Della Vigna and Malmendier (2005)’s analysis of gym memberships, and Grubb (2005) ’s analysis of
