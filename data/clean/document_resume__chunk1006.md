# Exhibit 3

There are two forms used for the administrative position, Dean of Instruction. In the document entitled Performance Standards, each domain is broken clow n into sub- criteria for which performance standards are developed. These are written at the "meets standards" level as an anchor for the performance rating. The degree to which standards are met, exceeded, or not met will determine the rating assigned on the document entitled Performance Appraisal Form. For administrative positions at this level, setting annual objectives and assessing results are key parts of performance appraisal. Parts III and IV allow for future planning and for assessment of the previous year's objectives. The appraisal summary in Part V encourages a developmental, positive approach in disctbsing employee strengths and possible areas for improvement.
