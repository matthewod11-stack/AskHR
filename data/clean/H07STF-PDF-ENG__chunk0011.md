# our careers more.

There’s four things that are contributing to this. We’re living longer and

longer, and as we live longer, we don’t want to have a long slide from

age 40, because we could easily be working another 40 years. We want to

make the most of it. That’s one.

Two is technology. I don’t have to say much about that, but it is

changing everything. It is disrupting jobs. It is creating new jobs. It’s

allowing us to work from anywhere. It creates a very interesting context

for being able to reinvent yourself.

The third one is our companies, organizations, our workplaces: they are

constantly disrupted too. That creates opportunities, but also creates

challenges. We’ve seen a huge wave of layoﬀs recently in the tech world

for example. Now people in the ﬁnancial sector are struggling with high

interest rates and what that means for their products, and the list goes

on. We don’t stay in jobs as long as we used to, either by choice or by

necessity as we are asked to leave them.
