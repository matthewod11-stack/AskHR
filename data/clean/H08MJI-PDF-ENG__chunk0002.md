Maybe you think it’s faster just to do it yourself. Or maybe you have

a deadline coming up and you don’t want to risk missing it. Or maybe

you don’t fully trust your team. If delegating feels like a struggle, you’re

not alone—but you are holding yourself back. Delegating isn’t just

oﬄoading tasks; it’s keeping things moving, developing your team, and

focusing on what matters most. So, where do you start? How do you stay

involved without hovering? And how do you stop thinking you’re the

only one who can do it right?
