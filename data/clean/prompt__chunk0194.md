# Step-back prompting

Step-back8 prompting is a technique for improving the pe(cid:455)ormance by prompting the LLM

to (cid:450)rst consider a general question related to the speci(cid:450)c task at hand, and then feeding the

answer to that general question into a subsequent prompt for the speci(cid:450)c task. This ‘step

back’ allows the LLM to activate relevant background knowledge and reasoning processes

before a(cid:459)empting to solve the speci(cid:450)c problem.

By considering the broader and underlying principles, LLMs can generate more accurate and

insigh(cid:458)ul responses. Step-back prompting encourages LLMs to think critically and apply their

knowledge in new and creative ways. It changes the (cid:450)nal prompt doing the task by utilizing

more knowledge in the LLM’s parameters than would otherwise come into play when the LLM

is prompted directly.

It can help to mitigate biases in LLM responses, by focusing on general principles instead of
