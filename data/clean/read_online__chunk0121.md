# WLB, Work-life balance conflict.

FIGURE 1: Age as a moderator on work-life balance conflictâ€“turnover intention relationship (two-way interaction).

H1.b: The relationship between work-life balance and intent to quit is moderated by gender.

The interaction effect between gender and WLBC (Figure 2) is not significant (p = 0.935).

Women have marginally higher turnover intentions than men, both at low and high levels of WLBC. The interaction effect is not significant, however, suggesting that men and women experience these relationships similarly in this context.

The finding is however at odds with various studies that found moderating effects of gender in the prediction of the turnover intentions of employees (Cotton & Tuttle 1986; Peltokorpi et al. 2015), but is in line with other studies that have failed to find gender to moderate predictors of the turnover intentions, as well as to moderate the relationship between work-life balance and turnover intentions (Du Plooy & Roodt 2013). This finding highlights the contextual relevance of gender as a moderator of these relationships.
