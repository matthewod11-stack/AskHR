# 7.4.2 Frame of Reference Training

Frame of reference (FOR) training helps improve rater accuracy by thoroughly familiar- izing raters with the various performance dimensions to be assessed. The overall goal is to give raters skills so that they can provide accurate ratings of each employee on each dimension by developing a common FOR.

Atypical FOR training program includes a discussion of the job description for the individuals being rated and the duties involved. Raters are then familiarized with the performance dimensions to be rated by reviewing the definitions for each dimension and discussing examples of good, average, and poor performance. Raters are then asked to use the appraisal forms to be used in the actual performance management system to rate fictitious employees usually shown in written or videotaped practice vignettes. The trainees are also asked to write a justification for the ratings. Finally, the trainer informs trainees of the correct ratings for each dimension and the reasons for such ratings and discusses differences between the correct ratings and those provided by the trainees. Typically, FOR training programs include the following formal steps:18
