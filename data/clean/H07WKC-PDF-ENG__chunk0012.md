## problem in a sort of reversion to the mean.

Welcome to your newest strategy team member

The reason why that isn’t inevitable became apparent when Wolfram

linked ChatGPT to its Mathematica software. When people ﬁrst tried to

use ChatGPT to solve math problems, they quickly found that it wasn’t

very good at math problems because it primarily relies on language

recognition. Although the AI could write a good university motivation

letter, perhaps, it sure couldn’t come up with an original proof for

Pythagoras’s theorem.

But that changed as soon as people cross-connected GPT to Wolfram’s

software, and the AI proved able to solve complex math showing

progress step-by-step. Inspired by that, we wondered what would

happen if we cross-connected ChatGPT to a strategic framework. What

we’ve discovered is that the virtual strategist turns out to be quite

original, and certainly deserves a place on your company’s team.

The strategic framework we chose for this purpose was the Blue Ocean

Framework developed in the 1990s and early 2000s by INSEAD’s W.

Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne. It is a framework that has about two

decades of research behind it and has proved enduringly successful. It

also has an extensive kit of heuristic tools that help strategists in their

decision making. By connecting these tools to ChatGPT’s AI we would
