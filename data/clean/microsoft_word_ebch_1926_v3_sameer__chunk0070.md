# INTRODUCTION

The process of employee selection and recruitment stands as a pivotal cornerstone in the foundation of any successful organization. In today's dynamic and competitive business environment, the importance of bringing the right individuals into the workforce cannot be overstated. This multifaceted process involves the identification, attraction, evaluation, and eventual hiring of candidates who possess the necessary skills, qualifications, and cultural fit to contribute positively to the company's goals and objectives.

Recruitment is the initial step in this intricate dance, wherein an organization actively seeks out potential candidates who match its job requirements and align with its values. The primary aim here is to cast a wide net and generate a pool of potential talent that can be further assessed. Recruitment strategies have evolved significantly over the years, moving from traditional methods such as newspaper advertisements to the digital era of job portals, social media platforms, and professional networking sites. Modern technology has not only expanded the reach of recruitment efforts but has also allowed for more targeted and efficient candidate sourcing [1], [2].

Once a pool of candidates is assembled, the selection process commences. This process can vary greatly in complexity depending on the nature of the job and the organization's specific needs.
