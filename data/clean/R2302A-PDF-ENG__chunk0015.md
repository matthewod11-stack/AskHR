## resolution time; for software engineers, speed of development and

deployment. Interestingly, when we decided to start measuring how

many items of work the engineers were able to ﬁnish, or “ship,” in

a month—rather than the number of whole projects they’d completed

—many people told us they could game the results by breaking up

the work into ever smaller parts. We told them to go ahead, and the

piecemeal approach generated faster and better results.
