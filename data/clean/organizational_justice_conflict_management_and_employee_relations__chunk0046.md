explored that organizational justice impacts on trust (Cohen-Charash and Spector, 2001; Aryee et al., 2002; Stinglhamber et al., 2006). Later on, Katou (2013) administered a similar study in the private and public sectors of Greece. The literature provides an insufficient justice and climate of trust explanation that the association between organizational in the domain of power sector was not yet examined. Thus, it is an initial step to analyze this relationship from an Indian perspective. Based on the above evidence, it can be formulated that:

H3. Organizational justice will have a significant relationship with climate of trust.

2.8 Conflict management and climate of trust The effective management of conflicts arriving at agreed upon solutions encompasses trust building between the parties involved (Lewicki et al., 2006). If the conflicts are not managed low organizational appropriately, commitment and high turnover rates (Yuan, 2010). In conflict situations, when the employees are being cared and valued by their supervisors and managers, a climate of trusting relationship is developed (Lewicki and Wiethoff, 2000; Chan et al., 2008). Masood and Javed (2016) reported that cooperative management of conflicts increases the level of trust among individuals. These statements are only theoretically interpreted by the eminent researchers. The significance of conflict management in generating a climate of trust is not empirically evidenced earlier. Therefore, in this research analysis, the authors have advocated a new line of investigation by exploring the relationship between conflict management and climate of trust in power sector organizations. The study, therefore, proposed a hypothesis that:

it may result into a lack of trust and cooperation,

H4. Conflict management will have a significant relationship with climate of trust.

2.9 Climate of trust and ER The strength of relationship is encouraged by the trust among the individuals working in an enterprise. In order to build trust, it is vital to creating a positive work environment characterized by honest and supportive relationships. Thus, flourishing a climate of trust is essential in a reciprocal relationship between employers and employees (Marlow and Patton, 2002). Empirical research viewed that trust has appeared as a critical element in maintaining the long-term relationship between organization and employees by acting as social glue (Lau and Rowlinson, 2010). This finding does not suffice the prerequisite of the current study as it was undertaken in a construction industry. By fulfilling the gap identified from the literature in the field of the power sector, we have extended the prior one and proposed a distinct model to empirically validate the relationship between climate of trust and ER. Trust creates obligations and is confined to the relationship between the trustor and the trustee (Redman et al., 2011). Hence, a hypothesis can be formulated as follows:

H5. Climate of trust will have a significant relationship with ER.

2.10 Mediating role of climate of trust In the previous sections, is an important outcome of organizational justice and conflict management as well as an antecedent to ER. Thus, theoretically, these findings suggest that trust functions as a mediator in the relationship between organizational justice and ER, and between conflict management and ER. The previous literature viewed that there are numerous studies on exploring the mediating effects of trust (Aryee et al., 2002; Chan et al., 2008; More and Tzafrir, 2009; Katou, 2013; Gaudencio et al., 2017). However, no studies have examined the role of climate of trust as a
