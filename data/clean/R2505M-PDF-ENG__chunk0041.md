Consider our experience advising the University of Guelph. Located

in Ontario, one of Canada’s agricultural heartlands, the university was

seeking to attract more grants to carry out research in regenerative agriculture, in which producers strike a balance between eﬃcient

farming and sustainable practices. Leaders at the university believed

they could best attract funding by showing the impact of their work.

They asked us to help them incubate new ventures (involving Guelph

researchers, farmers, and local entrepreneurs) that applied agricultural

technologies to tackling climate change.
