# Development

on job analysis techniques has indeed grown beyond its infancy, there is still not a strong body of research to answer the question of what is the best job analysis proce- dure to use in specific simations.5 In Principles for the Validation and Use of Personnel Selection Procedures, the following statement is made that, "There is currently no authoritative set of principles for job analysis comparable to the Standards or Principles in the area of selection procedures."6 The document continued by noting some specific things that a job analysis must do. (1) specify the descriptors or units of analysis by which the job will be defined, (2) develop task or activity statements for job-oriented analyses, and (3) develop behavioral statements or descriptors for worker- oriented analyses.

The categorization of job analyses into job-oriented and worker oriented is very useful. There are literally dozens of published job analysis procedures. Bemis, Belensky, and Soder reviewed ten such systems as bases for developing a system which draws on both job-oriented techniques and worker-oriented techniques-- Versatile Job Analysis System (VERJAS).7 The systems discussed by the authors range from the widely-used and generally well respected Department of Labor (DOL) procedure to the Guidelines Oriented Job Analysis (GOJA) which was developed specifically in response to legal and regulatory requirements.

To discuss a wide variety of these job analysis procedures goes well beyond the scope of this document. However, it is impoitant to have an understanding of the ways in which the job-oriented and worker-or- nted models differ. Ghorpode stated that job-oriented models tend to draw on the system framework for their definition.8 The analysis of a specific job is seen as the analysis of a sub-unit of the organization. Sidney Fine's Functional Job Analysis (FJA) is a good example of this particular model. Worker-oriented systems rest on preconceptions about the nature of the inter- relations between the aspects of the job and the individual in that position. The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) is a good example of the worker-oriented model. To explore the differences between these two approaches to job analyses, the FJA and the PAQ will be examined in more detail. Because of the importance of legal considera- tions, a brief discussion of GOJA will also be presented.
