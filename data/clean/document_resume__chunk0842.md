# Performance Appraisal

that forms, handbooks, and policy statements are just another set of procedures. No appraisal program, regardless of how well it is developed, will be effective or legally defensible unless administrators have a high level of commitment and make a continu- ous effort to carry out the complete process. A poor system can be made to work when the administrators make the effort to compensate for inadequacies in design. On the other hand, if a state-of-the-art system is poorly administered, it will surely fail.
