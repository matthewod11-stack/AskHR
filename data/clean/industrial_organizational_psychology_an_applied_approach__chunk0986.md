is needed to accurately determine the importance of similarity in interview decisions. Interviewee Appearance Meta-analyses (Barrick, Shaffer, & DeGrassi, ; Hosada, Stone-Romero, & Coats, ; Steggert, Chrisman, & Haap, ) indicate that, in general, physically attractive applicants have an advantage in interviews over less attractive applicants and applicants who dress professionally receive higher interview scores than do more poorly dressed applicants. This attractiveness bias occurred for men and women and for traditionally masculine and feminine job types. The appearance bias extends to weight, as research (Kutcher & Bragger, ; Pingitore, Dugoni, Tindale, & Spring, ) indicates that obese applicants receive lower interview scores than their leaner counterparts. Interviewee appearance, it seems, is a potent hiring factor (Posthuma, Morgeson, & Campion, ). Nonverbal Cues A meta-analysis by Barrick et al. () found that the use of appropri- ate nonverbal communication is highly correlated with interview scores. Appropriate nonverbal cues include such things as smiling and making appropriate eye contact (Levine & Feldman, ). Howard and Ferris () found a significant relationship between use of appropriate nonverbal behaviors and interviewer perceptions of interviewee competence. Not sur- prisingly, meta-analysis results indicate that structured interviews are not as affected by nonverbal cues as are unstructured interviews (Barrick et al., ). Meta-analysis results also indicate that the appropriate use of such verbal cues as tone, pitch, speech rate, and pauses is also related to higher interview scores (Barrick et al., ). Although many more studies and variables could be listed, this discussion shows that the interview contains many sources of bias that are not job related. Remember that one of the major purposes of the employment interview is to determine which applicant will be the most successful in performing a job. To determine this, decisions must be based on ability to do the job and not on such variables as physical attractiveness and eye contact.
