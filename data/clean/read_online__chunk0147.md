H1.e: The relationship between an increase work-life balance conflict and intent to quit is weakened at higher levels of engagement.

The interaction term for engagement is not significant (p = 0.152), suggesting that work engagement has little influence on reducing an individualâ€™s intent to quit at both low and high levels of work-life conflict. Figure 5 shows that individuals with a lower engagement report being more likely to quit at both high and low levels of WLBC, although the difference between these employees and those with higher reports of engagement is slightly narrowed at higher levels of WLBC. These results are similar to those of Naicker (2013) who found engagement to not moderate turnover intentions predictions.

H1.f: The relationship between increases in WLBC and intent to quit is strengthened at higher levels of stress.

Individuals with higher levels of stress (Figure 6) are not found to be significantly more likely to quit at higher levels of WLBC (p = 0.989). Individuals with higher stress are more likely to quit at both low and high levels of WLBC, but there is little difference between these and those experiencing lower levels of stress. Although a direct relationship has been found between stress and turnover intentions (Cropanzano, Rap & Bryne 2003; Moore 2000), in relationships between withdrawal this context cognitions and both WLBC and levels of stress seem to be independent of each other.
