## HBR / Digital Article / Employee Stress Is a Business Risk—Not an HR Problem

We believe that organizations must regularly use data on work stress

to reassess policies, practices, and cultural norms, if they want to

prevent employee stress from becoming a chronic and costly concern.

By embedding resilience into the fabric of the organization, we believe

that leaders can reduce the likelihood of disruption, protect workforce

health, and unlock a long-term competitive advantage.
