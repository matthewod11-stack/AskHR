# 500 Ethnic Minorities

Efrain Sanchez-Hidalgo was the ﬁrst Puerto Rican receiving a doctorate, while in 1962 Martha Bernal was the ﬁrst Mexican American woman awarded the PhD degree.

Within the American Psychological Association, although a woman was elected in early years as president (Mary Calkins was the 14th president), it took nearly 80 years for the ﬁrst ethnic minority to be so elected. Kenneth B. Clark served as president in 1971. Another 15 years was to pass before the next ethnic psychologist would become APA president—Logan Wright. Over a decade later, the author was elected to the APA presidency.
