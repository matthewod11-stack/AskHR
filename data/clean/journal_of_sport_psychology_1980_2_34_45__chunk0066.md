## Content Validity Based on Factor Interpretation

Not only was the five-factor solution stable but it was also found to be

meaningful. Each of these factors is described and interpreted below.

Factor 1—Training and Instruction. The first factor. Training and Instruc- tion, includes 13 items. It reflects one of the important functions of a coach—to improve the performance level of the athlete. The coach trains and instructs the athletes to help them reach their maximum physical potential. He or she is also expected to instruct them in how to acquire the necessary skills and to teach them the techniques and the tactics of the sports. In addition, in the case of team sports, the coach coordinates the activities of the team members.

The Training and Instruction factor in the context of sport is similar to the

Competitive Training factor identified by Danielson et al. (1975). It is also similar to the Instrumental Leadership dimension outlined by House and Dessler (1974) which essentially consists of role clarification, coaching, and coordination. Factor 2—Democratic Behavior. The factor of Democratic Behavior is com- posed of nine items. It reflects the extent to which the coach permits participation by the athletes in decision making. These decisions may relate to the setting of group goals and/or the ways in which these goals are to be attained.

Factor 3—Autocratic Behavior. Autocratic Behavior, a factor with five items, indicates the extent to which a coach keeps apart from the athletes and stresses his or her authority in dealing with them. In such situations, it is expected that the coach would demand strict compliance with his or her decisions.
