## HBR / The Big Idea / The Gender Gap in 6 Charts

Only one of the four measures rose between 2017 and 2018: economic

opportunity, largely due to a general boost in women’s income and to an

increase in the number of women in the tech space. All other categories,

while generally on the rise since 2006, took a slight dip. In particular,

women’s political empowerment dropped after almost a decade of slow

growth. The reason? Stalled or declining representation of women in political oﬃce in the West.
