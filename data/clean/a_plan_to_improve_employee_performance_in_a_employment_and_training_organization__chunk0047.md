There are many reasons employee performance may be low. Some possible

reasons why employees' performance levels vary include: a) Employees not knowing

'what they are supposed to do; b) Employees not knowing why they are doing it; c)

Employees do not know how to do it; d) Employees feel that there are obstacles to

completing their work; e) Employees are not interested in the work they do; f) Employees

have attitudes that interfere with their work; g) Employees lack the motivation to perform

their work; and h) the work environment may not provide incentive to be productive.
