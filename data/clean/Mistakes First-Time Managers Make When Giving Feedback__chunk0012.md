Even if you give feedback at the right time,

use the right words,and deliver it from a place of trust, it’s all useless if you don’tfollow up. When you give feedback without circling back, yourteam members could lose their motivation and may be less likelyto follow through on your suggestions. Without a follow up, youmay also not realize that your team is still struggling, or thedirection you suggested may not be working for them.

For feedback to work, it needs to be consistent. After providingfeedback, check in on your direct reports to see how they’reprogressing with their development. It can be as simple as askinga direct report: “In our last check in, we talked about you trying adifferent approach. How is that working for you?” When yourdiscussions are grounded in context — connecting the dotsbetween feedback and the person’s goals and aspirations — itbecomes a supportive conversation that promotes ongoinglearning.Keep in mind that feedback isn’t just criticism.

For example, you could say “You’ve been workingon refining your visual representation of customer data, and it’svery noticeable! You’re ready to be part of the next presentation tothe division head.”

Awareness of your mistakes will only get you so far — thisfoundational managerial skill demands repetition and practice.While it may feel uncomfortable or overwhelming at first, oncemastered, it will pay dividends throughout your career.
