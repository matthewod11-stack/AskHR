# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 101

formance. A measure of conscientious initiative may be more a measure of motivation than one of performance. Because demon- strating effort necessarily precedes any type of performance and is related to both task and contextual performance, conscientious initiative was expected to inï¬‚uence both personal support and task performance directly. In this model, task knowledge mediated the relationship between ability and task performance and the rela- tionship between achievement and task performance. Personal support knowledge did not mediate the relationship between agreeableness and personal support, and conscientious initiative knowledge did not mediate the relationship between achievement and conscientious initiative. Conscientious initiative did mediate the relationships between achievement and the dimensions of per- sonal support and task performance.
