A number of divisions of the APA have sections or commit- tees focused on women’s issues. One of the ﬁrst ones to es- tablish such a subgroup was the Division of Counseling Psychology. Among divisions that have active sections are the Society for Clinical Psychology, the Division of Psycho- therapy, and the Division of Psychoanalysis. The groups pub- lish newsletters, sponsor symposia and programs at the APA conventions and other conferences, and present awards.

The Southeastern Psychological Association (SEPA) was the site of a vibrant organization of women during the 1970s. In 1972, at the behest of several feminist psychologists, the in- coming president, Charles Speilberger, and the Executive CommitteeappointedtheﬁrstSEPACommissionontheStatus of Women, chaired by Ellen Kimmel. Not only did that group report on the status of women (Kimmel, 1974), it also initiated a number of activities that are still in place today, including a visiting scholars program and student research awards. The commission was so effective in enhancing the participation and status of women that the SEPA expanded its charge to include other underrepresented groups in addition to women, renaming it the Committee on Equality of Opportunity.

Another important organization is the Feminist Therapy Institute, established in 1983, which has held conferences and workshops, sponsored publications, and led feminists in protesting against diagnoses detrimental to women.

Finally, an innovative series of small conferences, devel- opedandsustainedbyFayeCrosby,hasbroughtpsychologists togetherininformalsettingsaroundtopicsonwomen,gender, and feminism. The conference series is called Nag’s Heart, a name that evolved from its forerunner, a conference series in social psychology held at Nag’s Head, North Carolina.
