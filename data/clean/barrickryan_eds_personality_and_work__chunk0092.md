# Are Two Factors Better Than One?

Two-factor solutions from several lexical studies also suggest a con- sistent pattern: one factor includes attributes associated with posi- tively valued dynamic qualities and individual ascendancy, whereas the other factor includes attributes associated with socialization, social propriety, solidarity, and community cohesion (Boies et al., 2001; Caprara, Barbanelli, & Zimbardo, 1997; Di Blas & Forzi, 1999; Digman, 1997; Goldberg & Somer, 2000; Hˇrebíˇcková, Os- tendorf, Osecká, & ˇCermák, 1999; Paulhus & John, 1998; Saucier, 1997; Shweder, 1972; White, 1980). Such a factor structure resem- bles that embodied in the theoretical model of Bakan (1966), who labeled the two factors Agency and Communion. In addition, these two factors may be aligned with some of the other sets of dual per- sonological constructs reviewed by Digman (1997) and by Paulhus and John (1998), including Hogan’s (1983) distinction between “getting ahead” (Dynamism) and “getting along” (Social Propriety).
