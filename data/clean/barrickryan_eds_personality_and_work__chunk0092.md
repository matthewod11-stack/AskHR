# 8 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Saucier, 1997). The ﬁndings from these studies have been quite consistent. The single factor contrasts a heterogeneous mix of de- sirable attributes at one pole with a mix of undesirable attributes at the other pole. This unrotated factor can be labeled Evaluation; it involves the contrast between socially desirable and socially un- desirable personal qualities. We expect this one-factor structure to be the most replicable one across languages and cultures based on two principles: (1) the more terms that are associated with a fac- tor, the more replicable should that factor be, and (2) because the ﬁrst unrotated factor will have the most terms associated with it, it should be the most ubiquitous factor.

Findings of a single large evaluative factor are no doubt related to a classic ﬁnding in psychology. In judgments about the mean- ings of diverse objects in a wide array of cultural settings, a global evaluation factor (good versus bad) was typically found to be the single largest factor (Osgood, May, & Miron, 1975). Osgood hy- pothesized that the ubiquity of this evaluative factor was related to basic evolutionary principles: our forebears would not have sur- vived if they had not become adapted at a very basic level to any signals of good versus bad objects or events—those leading to plea- sure versus pain (for example, Can I eat it or will it eat me?).
