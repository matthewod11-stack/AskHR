# Forced-Choice Rating Scales

One problem with BARS is that supervisors often do not use the anchors when rating employees. Instead, they choose a point on the scale and then quickly glance to see which anchor is associated with the number. Because of this tendency, BARS do not often reduce leniency in ratings.

To overcome this problem, forced-choice rating scales have been developed. These scales use critical incidents and relevant job behaviors, as do BARS, but the scale points are hidden. An example of a forced-choice scale is shown in Figure ..

In using the forced-choice scale to evaluate employee performance, the supervisor chooses the behavior in each item that appears most typical of that performed by a given employee. The supervisor’s choices then are scored by a member of the personnel department to yield the employee’s rating on each dimension. The scores on each of the dimensions can be summed to form an overall rating.

The development of a forced-choice rating scale is a long and compli- cated process, which partly explains why it is not commonly used. However, this method of evaluation does have its advantages. For example, because the supervisor must choose behaviors without knowing “the key,” common rating errors such as leniency and halo are less likely. Consequently, performance evalu- ations should be more accurate.
