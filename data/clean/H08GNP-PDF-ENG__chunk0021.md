## poor emotional regulation, techniques such as mindfulness, stress

management, and cognitive-behavioral strategies can help leaders

or the other way around. Additionally, selecting individuals with high

self-control and emotional stability can help ensure consistent, fair

leadership. Organizations should also create channels for employees to

report abusive behavior and have clear protocols for holding leaders
