# 46 PERSONALITY AND WORK

artists often have bipolar disorder (Andreasen, 1987; Goodwin & Jamison, 1990; Richards, Kinney, Lunde, Benet, & Merzel, 1988) and that creative episodes often occur when the person is in a hypomanic (mildly manic) as opposed to depressive state (Richards, 1994; Richards & Kinney, 1990). This ﬁnding supports the notion that high positive affect is associated with creativity. But Feist (1998) noted that the personality traits that predicted creativity among artists were different from those that predicted creativity among sci- entists, and so creativity may be multidimensional and inﬂuenced by multiple factors. More research must be conducted before we can determine whether all types of creativity are related to and inﬂu- enced by positive affect and feelings of well-being.

Implications for Work and Productivity Fredrickson (1998) holds that happiness signals that one is safe and secure. This feeling may then prompt individuals to be play- ful and to try new things, a tendency that may result in novel solu- tions to problems and creative new ideas. However, creativity and playfulness may be adaptive only when workers have the freedom to play and when novel solutions are likely to increase perfor- mance. Certain tasks must be accomplished by following a precise set of guidelines, and the desire to try new things in these tasks may in fact result in decreased efﬁciency and perhaps even more mis- takes. Thus, before researchers can determine whether the increased creativity that happy people exhibit will increase productivity, they must determine whether creative, playful approaches to a job will be helpful or detrimental to the overall functioning of their orga- nization (for a similar interactional approach to understanding the associations between creativity and the traits of openness and con- scientiousness, see George & Zhou, 2001).
