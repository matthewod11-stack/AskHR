## Theories of Origin and Research in Antisocial Personality

Much experimental research has been generated by clinical assumptions about the characteristics and etiology of antiso- cial personality disorder. Keep in mind that most of these studies have been restricted to subjects in prisons or in psy- chiatric facilities. Such subjects are not only more likely to be extreme in their manifestation of sociopathy, but the effect of imprisonment of hospitalization may have inﬂuenced the obtained results.

Early theories of motivation postulated that all organisms are driven by a need to reduce sensory stimulation. In 1949, Hebb suggested instead that behavior can be motivated to increase sensory stimulation. Quay (1965) hypothesized that sociopaths, compared to normal people, have a lower basal reactivity to stimulation and so need more intense sensory input in order to maintain a level of cortical function ade- quate for the subjective experience of pleasure. Hence, they require more intense levels of stimulation.

It has also been suggested that the antisocial behavior of sociopaths reﬂects their inability to delay gratiﬁcation of emotions and inhibit their impulses to action. Research re- sults are inconsistent in their support of this hypothesis.
