# 5.4(cid:32) Limitations of the study

Out of the 100 intended respondents only 80 respondents from 20 branches

submitted their questionnaires. The sample size was also not large enough due to

time constraints. This left out valuable contribution from the respondents in the

remaining branches and head office units who are involved in coaching. These

respondents could have added more information to the study.

The study was focused on only one organization Cooperative Bank of Kenya. It

therefore may not be representative of all organization in the country. However it

has taken into account other views along theoretical analysis.
