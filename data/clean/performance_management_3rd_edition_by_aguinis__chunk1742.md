from the automotive division of Sears, a leading retailer of apparel, home, and automo- tive products and services, with annual revenues of more than US $40 billion.

The California Consumer Affairs Commission conducted an 18-month investigation, during which it sent some of its members to the auto centers posing as customers. What did they find? Sears employees were “finding” a lot of problems and making a lot of unnecessary repairs.
