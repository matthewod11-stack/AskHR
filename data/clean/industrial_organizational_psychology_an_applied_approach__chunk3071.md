# What Is a Work Team?

According to Devine, Clayton, Philips, Dunford, and Melner (), a work team is “a collection of three or more individuals who interact intensively to provide an organizational product, plan, decision, or service” (p. ). At times, putting employees into teams fails because the team is really a “group” or a “commit- tee” rather than a true team. In fact, according to a survey of practitioners who work with teams, only % of work groups would be officially classified as a team (Offermann & Spiros, ). Before calling a group of individuals a team, several factors should be considered (Donnellon, ).

Identifi cation Identification is the extent to which group members identify with the team rather than with other groups. For example, suppose a committee was created composed of one representative from each of five different departments (e.g., accounting, engineering, human resources). During the meetings, members use such state- ments as “Our department won’t agree,” “This committee just doesn’t like those of us in engineering,” or “We didn’t even want to be on this committee.” Notice that the use of we, our, and us refers to their departments rather than to the com- mittee. According to Donnellon (), for the committee to be considered a team, those same words would need to refer to the committee: for example, “How can we convince the accounting department?” or “Our solution is a good one.”

Interdependence In a team, members need and desire the assistance, expertise, and opinions of the other members. If a team member can perform her job without the assistance of others, the team would not meet the definition of a group (see pp. ). For example, some teams, such as a surgical team in a hospital, have very high task interdependence in that what one member does greatly influences what another member does. Other teams (most committees) have low task interdependence in that each member completes a task and the separate parts are then compiled. Though each part is important in completing the final product, the completion of each part is not dependent on another group member. The importance of task interdependence was demonstrated by Liden, Wayne, and Bradway (), who found that empowerment increased the performance of teams with high task inter- dependence (e.g., team members had to get information from each other, worked together on projects) but decreased the performance of teams with low task inter- dependence (e.g., did their work separately, did not have to rely on others).

Power Diff erentiation In a team, members try to decrease power differentiation by treating others as equals and taking steps to ensure equality. In groups that are not teams, members challenge, correct, and interrupt each other, give orders, and use sarcasm. For example, I worked with one organization that had an “administrative team.” What I discovered, however, was that one individual in that team was treated differently, had less authority, and had no voting power. Consequently, rather than being a “team,” they were a “committee.”

In teams, members apologize for overstepping their roles, ask indirect questions to avoid challenges, and are polite to one another (Donnellon, ). For example, in a team, a member might disagree with another member by saying something like, “I don’t know your field as well as you do, but what if we tried . . . ”;

whereas, in a nonteam, a member might disagree by saying, “That’s so stupid. I’ll tell you what will work.”

Social Distance In a team, members try to decrease social distance by being casual, using nick- names, and expressing liking, empathy, and common views. Nonteam members use formal language and forms of address, excessive politeness, and impersonal conversations. For example, team members would use such phrases as “Hey, how’s it going?” “Thanks, pal,” and “I understand your feelings on that.” Nonteam members might address another member as “Mr. Jones” rather than “Bob” or agree with someone by saying, “I concur with your opinion” rather than “I’m right with you on that one.”

Confl ict Management Tactics Team members respond to conflict by collaborating, whereas nonteam members respond by forcing and accommodating (these terms will be discussed later in the chapter). In nonteams, members react to conflict by threatening, directing, or giving in. In teams, members try to understand the others’ views, make attempts to compromise, and use nonthreatening tones (Donnellon, ).

Negotiation Process In teams, members negotiate in a win-win style in which the goal is for every person to come out ahead. In nonteams, members negotiate so that they win and the other members lose.

On the basis of the six factors just discussed, Donnellon () placed teams into one of five categories: collaborative teams, emergent teams, adversarial teams, nominal teams, and doomed teams. Collaborative teams and emergent teams are what I have referred to as true teams, whereas nominal teams and doomed teams are what I have referred to as nonteams. Adversarial teams are somewhere in between a true team and a nonteam.

Though not affecting the extent to which a group is officially a team, teams differ in two other ways. Teams differ as to their permanency. That is, some teams are designed to work together permanently, whereas others are formed to solve a particular problem and then are expected to dissolve. For example, I was appointed to a university task force designed to create a new system for students to use to evaluate faculty. Once the system was created, our team disbanded.

Teams can also differ in the proximity of their members. Members of surgical teams, baseball teams, and the cast of a Broadway play not only are task interde- pendent but work physically close to one another. In many instances, however, members of teams may be located across several cities, states, or countries. Because of the expense of bringing such teams to the same location, companies like IBM, USFilter, and KDA Software use virtual teams, whose members carry out their team functions through email, teleconferencing, and computer-based videocon- ferencing (Joinson, ). Though virtual teams can certainly be productive, they tend to struggle with building trust, creating synergy, and overcoming feelings of isolation (Kirkman, Rosen, Gibson, Tesluk, & McPherson, ).
