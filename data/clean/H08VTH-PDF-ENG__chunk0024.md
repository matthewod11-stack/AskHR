# creativity rise.

Resist the temptation to push through at all costs. Resilience requires

knowing when to step back so you can step up when it counts. Whether

it’s conducting walking 1:1s, putting up clear calendar boundaries, or

having a “no meetings” block, protect your energy like it’s part of the

job—because it is.

. . .

When your span of control stretches overnight, it’s easy to feel buried by

decisions, demands, and sheer volume. But leadership at scale is about

leading diﬀerently, not simply doing more. You won’t get it perfect—

you don’t need to. But if you can shift from reacting to intentionally

resetting how you lead, you won’t just survive the avalanche; you’ll help

your team ﬁnd solid ground and start building again.
