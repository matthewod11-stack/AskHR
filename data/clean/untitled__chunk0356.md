# School Psychology

Unlike the other three practice specialties, the Second World War had much less impact on the practice of school psychol- ogy. Such practice has always been more circumscribed, as the label would imply. Furthermore, whereas the doctoral degree has been assumed to be the minimal level of training necessary for professional practice in the other three special- ties, historically most school psychologists have practiced with a master’s degree or specialty credential. Further, in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, school psychologists came from many different educational backgrounds, sometimes with little training in psychology.

Fagan (1990) has divided the history of school psychology into “Hybrid years” (1890–1969) and “Thoroughbred years” (1970 to present). The Hybrid years describe a period when school psychology was “a blend of many kinds of educa- tional and psychological practitioners loosely mobilized around a dominant role of psychoeducational assessment for special class placement” (p. 913). That role still exists in the Thoroughbred years, but the practitioner is more narrowly deﬁned as a school psychologist, typically someone who has a master’s or doctoral degree in school psychology from a nationally accredited program.

The ﬁrst master’s degree training program for school psy- chologists was initiated at New York University in 1928 and the ﬁrst doctoral training program at the University of Illinois in 1953. The APA did not begin accrediting doctoral pro- grams in school psychology until 1971, and only accredits at the doctoral level. Master’s degree programs are accredited by the NationalAssociation of School Psychologists (NASP), an organization founded in 1969.

Like the other practice specialties, there have been sig- niﬁcant postwar changes for school psychologists as they, too, have struggled to ﬁnd their identity as a profession (see the report of the Thayer Conference, Cutts, 1955). Still, the Thoroughbred years have been ones of tremendous growth in training and practice for the ﬁeld. Psychological services in the schools have increased dramatically since the 1970s, in part stimulated by America’s baby boom, but also by federal legislation on education, particularly laws on special educa- tion such as the landmark Public Law 94-142, enacted in 1974, which mandated education for all children regardless of handicap.
