Why it happens

One might wonder why clever people undertake investments that dilute

their ﬁrm’s strategy or diﬀerentiation. As it happens, there are many

good reasons why. First, there is the issue that when an investment is

being evaluated, nobody knows for sure if it will lead to dilution and/or

if it does, how much dilution there would be. It is only after the fact —

and often, long time after the fact — that the dilution eﬀect becomes

apparent and by that time, the damage has been done.

Second, it is rarely one big decision that leads to dilution. More often

than not, it is a series of many small decisions, taken over a long

period, that cumulatively lead to dilution. Since ﬁrms evaluate each

investment on its own merits at the time they are considering it,

individual investments may not appear as too damaging to the ﬁrm’s

diﬀerentiation; and since the investments are taken over a long period of time, it is diﬃcult to assess their cumulative eﬀect, which is the real
