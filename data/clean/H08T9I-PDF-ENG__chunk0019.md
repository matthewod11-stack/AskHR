## India, China, Russia, and Eastern Europe.

When an industry is nascent, innovating tends to win because many

valuable, unexplored opportunities await discovery. For example,

following the introduction of Ford’s Model T in 1908, GM entered

the market by imitating the Model T’s aﬀordability and reliable

quality. But after unsuccessful imitation attempts, GM decided to

innovate and move into completely diﬀerent territory: by segmenting

the market and introducing colorful cars with neatly designed closed

bodies. The industry was simply too young to standardize around the

Model T; superior designs remained undiscovered, and companies that

pioneered these alternatives achieved remarkable success.
