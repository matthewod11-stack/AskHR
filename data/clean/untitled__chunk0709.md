# Methodological Behaviorism

Although methodological behaviorists agreed that conscious- ness stood outside scientiﬁc psychology, they disagreed about how to explain behavior. The dominant tradition was the stimulus-response tradition originating with Thorndike, and carried along with modiﬁcation by Watson, Hull, and his colleagues, and the mediational behaviorists of the 1950s. They all regarded learning as a matter of strengthening or weakening connections between environmental stimuli and the behavioral response they evoked in organisms. The most important rival form of methodological behaviorism was the cognitive-purposive psychology of Tolman and his followers, who kept alive representational theories of learning. In short, the stimulus-response tradition studied how organisms react to the world; the cognitive tradition studied how organisms learn about the world. Unfortunately, for decades it was not realized that these were complementary rather than compet- ing lines of investigation.

Stimulus-Response Theories. By far the most inﬂuen- tial learning theories of the Golden Age of Theory were stimulus-response (S-R) theories. S-R theorizing began with Edward Lee Thorndike’s (1874–1949) connectionism. Thorndike studied animal learning for his 1898 disserta- tion, published as Animal Learning in 1911. He began as a conventional associationist studying association of ideas in animals. However, as a result of his studies he concluded that while animals make associations, they do not associate ideas: “The effective part of the association [is] a direct bond between the situation and the impulse [to behavior]” (Thorndike, 1911, p. 98).

Thorndike constructed a number of puzzle boxes in which he placed one of his subjects, typically a young cat. The puzzle box was a sort of cage so constructed that the animal could open the door by operating a manipulandum that typically operated a string dangling in the box, which in turn ran over a pulley and opened the door, releasing the animal, who was then fed before being placed back in the box. Thorndike wanted to discover how the subject learns the

correct response. He described what happens in a box in which the cat must pull a loop or button on the end of the string:

The cat that is clawing all over the box in her impulsive struggle will probably claw the string or loop or button so as to open the door. And gradually all the other nonsuccessful impulses will be stamped out and the particular impulse leading to the success- ful act will be stamped in by the resulting pleasure, until, after many trials, the cat will, when put in the box, immediately claw the button or loop in a deﬁnite way. (Thorndike, 1911, p. 36)

Thorndike conceived his study as one of association- formation, and interpreted his animals’ behaviors in terms of associationism:

Starting, then, with its store of instinctive impulses, the cat hits upon the successful movement, and gradually associates it with the sense-impression of the interior of the box until the connec- tion is perfect, so that it performs the act as soon as confronted with the sense-impression. (Thorndike, 1911, p. 38)

The phrase trial-and-error—or perhaps more exactly trial- and-success—learning aptly describes what these animals did in the puzzle boxes. Placed inside, they try out (or, as Skinner called it later, emit) a variety of familiar behaviors. In cats, it was likely to try squeezing through the bars, claw- ing at the cage, and sticking its paws between the bars. Even- tually, the cat is likely to scratch at the loop of string and so pull on it, ﬁnding its efforts rewarded: The door opens and it escapes, only to be caught by Thorndike and placed back in the box. As these events are repeated, the useless behaviors die away, or extinguish, and the correct behavior is done soon after entering the cage; the cat has learned the correct re- sponse needed to escape.

Thorndike proposed three laws of learning. One was the law of exercise, which stated that use of a response strength- ens its connection to the stimuli controlling it, while disuse weakens them. Another was the law of readiness, having to do with the physiological basis of the law of effect. Thorndike proposed that if the neurons connected to a given action are prepared to ﬁre (and cause the action), their neural ﬁring will be experienced as pleasure, but that if they are inhibited from ﬁring, displeasure will be felt.

The most famous and debated of Thorndike’s laws was the
