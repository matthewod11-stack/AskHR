# The Realist Tradition

Hume’s fellow Scottish philosophers, led by Thomas Reid (1710–1796), offered one diagnosis and remedy. Berkeley and Hume challenged common sense, suggesting that exter- nal objects do not exist, or, if they do, we cannot know them or causal relationships among them with any certainty. Reid defended common sense against philosophy, arguing that the Way of Ideas had led philosophers into a sort of madness. Reid reasserted and reworked the older realist tradition. We see objects themselves, not inner representations of them. Because we perceive the world directly, we may dismiss Berkeley’s immaterialism and Hume’s skepticism as absurd consequences of a mistaken notion, the Way of Ideas. Reid also defended a form of nativism. God made us, endowing us with mental powers—faculties—upon which we can rely to deliver accurate information about the outside world and its operations.
