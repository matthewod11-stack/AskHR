# The Idealist Tradition

Another diagnosis and remedy for skepticism was offered in Germany by Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), who, like Reid, found Hume’s ideas intolerable because they made genuine knowledge unreachable. Reid located Hume’s error in the Way of Ideas, abandoning it for a realist analysis of cognition. Kant, on the other hand, located Hume’s error in empiricism and elaborated a new version of the Way of Ideas that located truth inside the mind. Empiricists taught that ideas reﬂect, in Locke’s phrase, “things themselves,” the mind conforming it- self to objects that impress (Hume’s term) themselves upon it. But for Kant, skepticism deconstructed empiricism. The as- sumption that mind reﬂects reality is but an assumption, and once this assumption is revealed—by Berkeley and Hume— the ground of true knowledge disappears.
