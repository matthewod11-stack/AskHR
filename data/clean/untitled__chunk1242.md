# Appraisal of the Current Era

will whet the reader’s appetite for further exploration. Fuller reviews of our historical roots are available in Parke, Ornstein, Rieser, and Zahn-Waxler (1994) and Cairns (1998), and a reprint series of original articles and volumes by earlier theorists is available in Wozniak (1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1995). We have divided the history of developmental psychology into ﬁve time periods—the beginning years of developmen- tal psychology (1880–1914), the period of institutionaliza- tion and fragmentation (1915–1940), the era of expansion (1940–1960), the rise of contemporary themes (1960–1985), and the current period (1985 to present). Across these peri- ods, we discuss recurring issues of theory and method to illustrate the ways in which there has been both constancy and change in developmental psychologists’ views of the central issues of the ﬁeld. We argue that, in many regards, there have been major strides in the subtlety of the distinc- tions and the sophistication of the measurements and designs brought to bear on developmental questions. At the same time, there is much consistency between the perspectives of our ancestors of a century ago and the views of contemporary developmental theorists.

Another thesis is that the agenda of contemporary devel- opmental psychology has more in common with the ﬁeld’s agenda from the turn of the century than with the agenda of the middle era (1920–1960). This middle period, with its
