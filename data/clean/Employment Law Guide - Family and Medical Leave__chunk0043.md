# employee by including the notice in employee handbooks or other written guidance to employees concerning

beneﬁts or leave rights if such written materials exist. If such written materials do not exist, the employer may accomplish this by distributing a copy of the general notice to each new employee upon hire. In either case,

distribution may be accomplished electronically.

An employer may duplicate the text of the Poster to meet this general notice requirement, or may use another

format so long as the information provided includes, at a minimum, all of the information contained in that

notice. Where an employer's workforce is comprised of a signiﬁcant portion of workers who are not literate in English, the employer must provide the general notice in a language in which the employees are literate.

Eligibility notice. When an employee requests FMLA leave or the employer acquires knowledge that an

employee's leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer must notify the employee of the

employee's eligibility to take FMLA leave within ﬁve business days, absent extenuating circumstances. The

eligibility notice must state whether the employee is eligible for FMLA leave, and if the employee is not eligible, must state at least one reason why the employee is not eligible.

The Department of Labor makes available a Prototype Eligibility and Rights and Responsibilities

Notice(https://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh-381.pdf) (Form WH-381), which employers may adapt as appropriate for

their use to meet their eligibility and rights and responsibilities (see below) notice requirements.

Rights and Responsibilities notice. Each time the eligibility notice is provided, the employer is also required to provide a written notice detailing the speciﬁc expectations and obligations of the employee and explaining any

consequences of a failure to meet these obligations. If leave has already begun, the employer should mail the

notice to the employee's address of record. The employer must translate this notice in any situation where it is

obligated to translate the general notice into a language in which employees are literate. The written notice

must also include information on:

Leave may be designated and counted against the employee's annual FMLA leave entitlement if it qualiﬁes

as FMLA leave
