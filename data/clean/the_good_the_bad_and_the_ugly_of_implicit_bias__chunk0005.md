## The good, the bad, and the ugly of implicit bias

The concept of implicit bias, also termed unconscious bias, and the related Implicit Association Test (IAT) rests on the belief that people act on the basis of internalised schemas of which they are unaware and thus can, and often do, engage in discriminatory behaviours without conscious intent.1 This idea increasingly features in public discourse and scholarly inquiry with regard to discrimination,1 providing a foundation through which to explore the why, how, and what now of gender inequity. Attention to the gender gap in academia, particularly pronounced in the science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) ﬁelds,2 has led many institutions to mandate implicit bias training.1,3 Here we critically explore the impact of such interventions, illuminating the good, the bad, and

the ugly of implicit bias and the implications for women in science. Although it is essential to promote awareness of gender inequities, the current focus on implicit bias risks masking broader social, structural, and political barriers to women’s advancement.

Scholarship in implicit bias has helped to unveil a troubling gender bias in academia, whereby men’s competencies, skills, productivity, leadership potential, and quality of work are consistently judged to be superior on the basis of gender identiﬁcation alone.1,4 Implicit bias training can make individuals aware of their unintentional involvement in the perpetuation of discrimination and inequity as well as the unrecognised advantages they enjoy based on group membership. Such training encourages individuals to confront their own biases and unearned privileges and to learn strategies aimed at reducing discriminatory thoughts and practices.5 Additionally, as the concept of implicit bias has gained popularity, it has enriched public consciousness and discourse on gender inequity.5 These are all important building blocks for creating change and thus represent inherent goods of the implicit bias trend.

in changing individual-level beliefs and actions,4 but meta-analyses suggest it is largely ineﬀective in dimin- ishing institutional inequities.6 For instance, women remain disproportionately less likely to receive faculty appointments, obtain leadership positions, earn compa rable wages, receive grant funding, and are more likely to leave the academy prematurely.1,3,7,8 A focus on implicit bias partly contributes to this lack of change by emphasising agency (eg, individual choice) over structure (eg, institutional, organisational, and

political systems), ignoring the latter’s role in framing not only the beliefs and actions of individuals but also the rules, regulations, laws, and culture that govern social institutions.9 For instance, academia is entrenched in a masculinised model of success with institutional its meritocratic principles that practices and privilege traits, career styles, work practices, and preferences of men (eg, competitive, hierarchical), overlooking the ways that these can conﬂict with some women’s lives and work- related preferences (eg, collaborative, egalitarian).7–10 Furthermore, when women excel in this masculinised environment, they are often criticised because such behaviours clash with conventional social expectations of feminine comportment.4,7 This double bind has been an impediment to women’s advancement in research settings,8 one that implicit bias training alone cannot resolve. Research also suggests such training can actually reinforce, magnify, or normalise biases if educational messaging is overly prescriptive.11
