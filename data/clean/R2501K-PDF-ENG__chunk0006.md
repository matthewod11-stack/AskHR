## unpredictability: vertical slicing. Traditional project-management

approaches are all about running tests, analyzing results—and then

implementing the project. The slicing technique is diﬀerent: It delivers

the project test by test. Each slice builds on the previous one to ﬂesh

out the larger-scale initiative. Think of the project as a cake—each

slice has layers of frosting, ﬁlling, and cake, representing the diﬀerent

components of the project. Using the slicing technique, managers can

run many small tests in diﬀerent areas of uncertainty, and use the

ﬁndings to make better decisions and deliver ﬁnal products more

quickly. An early slice of a new dating app, for example, might be a

simple website to sign up customers and a psychologist in the back oﬃce who manually proposes matches to the ﬁrst 100 people and

connects them by email. For users, the app tastes like the whole cake,

so to speak: They sign up, get matched, and connect with other users.
