# with me:

“Culturally, I think we have an expectation that an innate

motherhood gene will activate the minute we birth our babies. That

we will magically know how to handle parenthood and also enjoy

every stage of it. It’s wildly untrue, and can cause a lot of self-doubt

and self-loathing. We all learn as we go, and your matrescence

journey is uniquely personal based on your personality, preferences,

life circumstances, and support systems.”
