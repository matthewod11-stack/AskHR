# Flexibility — not judgment

Flexibility in where and when work gets done is crucial for parents

and nonparents alike. But a 2022 survey found that 86% of respondents

believed that parents take precedence when it comes to ﬂexible work;

81% believed that child-related reasons for being unavailable were more

valid than reasons of employees without children. Parenthood is a

demanding role but only one type of caretaking. Many nonparents also

have caregiving responsibilities for family, friends, neighbors, or even

pets. And everyone has a life outside of their job. Leaders should oﬀer

ﬂexible work without judgment, and model it by being transparent

when taking time oﬀ for reasons unrelated to children. Flexible work

should be oﬀered to all employees without requiring a justiﬁcation as to

why they use it.
