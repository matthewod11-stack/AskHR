# Don’t

- Let your goals remain abstract or out of sight; write them down

and keep them visible in your workspace to help train your brain to

concentrate on what’s most important.

- Assume shallow interactions are inevitable; instead, practice active

listening by maintaining eye contact, tuning into what others are

saying, and asking questions.

- Mistake scrolling or consuming content for an actual break. A true

break allows your brain to reset and recover.
