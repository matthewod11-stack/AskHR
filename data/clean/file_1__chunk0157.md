# Conceptual paper

In spite of the growing literature concerning the gender pay gap, there is limited research about the way individuals perceive the phenomenon (Gerhart and Rynes, 2003; Judge and Livingston, 2008; Lange, 2008). However, investigating perceptions of the gender pay gap may help answering the question of why it persists and how to overcome it. This paper aims at developing a conceptual framework, which describes concrete factors that may explain individuals’ perceptions of the gender pay gap.

By analyzing social comparison (Festinger, 1954), equity (Adam, 1965), occupational socialization (Smith and Rogers, 2000), relative deprivation (Crosby, 1982), expectancy (Vroom, 1964), and social dominance (Sidanius and Pratto, 1999) theories as well as the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999), this paper identifies a number of individual and organizational predictors of individuals’ perceptions of the gender pay gap. Such factors as pay expectations, gender role orientation, perceived pay fairness, gender, age, marital status, education, sector gender composition, and occupational status are proposed to be related to their perceptions.
