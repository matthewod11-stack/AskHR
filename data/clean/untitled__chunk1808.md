## From Animal Spirits to Animal Electricity

In the sixteenth century Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) re- ported that nerves appear solid and therefore could not serve as conduits for pneuma. In the seventeenth century, William Harvey (1578–1657) discovered the circulation of the blood. He demonstrated that the heart is a pump that propels blood through the body by mechanical action. This ended the need for the theory that vital spirits provide the impetus for the pulsing of the blood. However, the concept of animal spirits was not abandoned based on these discoveries, but continued in use to explain psychological function and mental illness beyond the seventeenth century. The neurology of the French philosopher, René Descartes (1596–1650), depended on the notion of animal spirits being shunted along tubular nerves from the sense organs to the brain. In 1660, Highmore (cited in Lopez-Piñero, 1983) described animal spirits as minutest ﬁery particles, rareﬁed in the heart by fermentation and,

mixed with blood, transmitted through the arteries to the brain where they are separated from the blood and stored in the channels and ventricles of the brain for use under the di- rection of the soul. Thomas Willis (1684) published a fairly accurate description of nerves and his theories about convul- sive diseases. He conjectured that animal spirits formed in the brain produce motions by explosive action. When this ex- plosive action is excessive, convulsions and mental disease result.

AfterIsaacNewton(1642–1726)publishedhisPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687, the concept of ani- mal spirits was redeﬁned as a vital gravitational force (elan vita).TheItaliananatomistLuigiGalvani(1737–1798)reported that electrical energy is propagated along the nerves and gener- ates muscular movement, a discovery that ﬁnally led to the abandonment of the belief that animal spirits move through tubular nerves. However, the doctrine of animal spirits was not wholly replaced as a physiological explanation for sensation and action and the notion of “animal electricity” (vis nervosa) replaced that of animal spirits. Clarke and Jacyna (1987) com- ment as follows:

It is a remarkable fact that a concept of how a nerve functioned should have survived almost intact from Greco-Roman antiquity to the nineteenth century, but this was the case with the doctrine of the hollow nerve. . . . The basic supposition was that messages could travel along the lumen of the hollow nerve, and although subjected to various modiﬁcations, the theory was still alive in the early 1800s. Because it was universally accepted for so many centuries, owing chieﬂy to the authority of Galen, we can con- clude that it must have satisﬁed the majority of scientists and physicians. (p. 160)

The theory was ﬁnally overthrown by research on animal electricity ﬁrst reported by Galvani in 1791.

The declining inﬂuence of the humoral theory was accom- panied by an increasing interest in so-called nervous disease. This rather loosely deﬁned concept distinguished between insanity and less disabling disturbances found with some fre- quency in the general population.

In Britain, nervous diseases were assumed to be more common in the leisured classes as a result of insufﬁcient fresh air, lack of exercise, adultery, abuse of medicine, excessive study, and others previously listed by Burton (1651/1927) as causes of melancholy. Robert Whytt (1765) complained,

. . . the disorders which are the subject of the following observa- tions have been treated by authors under the names of ﬂatulent, hypochondriac, or hysteric. Physicians have bestowed the char- acter of nervous on all those disorders whose nature and cause they were ignorant of. (p. III)

Despite Whytt’s caveat, William Cullen (1784), the inﬂuen- tial nosologist, considered all diseases, but especially psychic diseases, to be neuroses. For many years the term neurosis, ﬁrst coined by Cullen, referred to a biological disorder of the nervous system, but one not localized to a speciﬁc part of the nervous system. According to Cullen, life is maintained by brain energy ﬂowing from the central nervous system to muscles and solid organs; disease results if the energy is inadequate. The debate about the presence or absence of a neurological disorder underlying the neuroses continued well into the late nineteenth century.
