Some critics go much further in their indictment of ﬁnancial measures.

They argue that the terms of competition have changed and that

traditional ﬁnancial measures do not improve customer satisfaction,

quality, cycle time, and employee motivation. In their view, ﬁnancial

performance is the result of operational actions, and ﬁnancial success

should be the logical consequence of doing the fundamentals well. In

other words, companies should stop navigating by ﬁnancial measures.

By making fundamental improvements in their operations, the ﬁnancial

numbers will take care of themselves, the argument goes.
