# 8.1.2 Content of Developmental Plan

What does a developmental plan look like? Plans should include a description of specific steps to be taken and specific objectives to reach. In other words, what is the new skill or knowledge that will be acquired and how will this occur? This includes information on the resources and strategies that will be used to achieve the objectives. For example, will the employee learn the skill from a coworker through on-the-job training? Will the company reimburse the employee for expenses associated with taking an online course?

The plan’s objectives should include not only the end product, such as the new skill to be learned, but also the completion date and how the supervisor will know whether the new skill has indeed been acquired. For example, in the case of the online course, the objective could state that the course will be completed by July 23, 2012, and the employee is expected to receive a grade of B+ or better. Overall, objectives included in the developmental plans should be practical, specific, time oriented, linked to a stan- dard, and developed jointly by the supervisor and the employee.

An additional important feature of developmental plans is that they should keep the needs of both the organization and the employee in mind. The choice of what specific skills or performance areas will be improved is dictated by the needs of the organization, especially when the organization is investing in the plan. In addi- tion, the plan created is dictated by the needs of the individual. The supervisor and the employee need to agree on what development or new skills will help enrich the employee’s work experience as well as help accomplish organizational goals now or in the near future.

As an example, consider the content of the developmental plan at Texas A&M. First, employees are directed to a Web site that includes examples of possible devel- opmental activities (http://hr.tamu.edu/ed/suggest.pdf). This list includes work- shops; certifications; local, state, and national conferences; on-the-job training; and other activities. This information presents employees and managers with various options they can use to achieve the developmental objectives. Second, the form includes space so that each professional developmental need is paired with a description of resources or support needed and a time frame for completion. For example, the developmental plan for an administrative assistant in the business school may look like this:

Overall, the Texas A&M plan includes all of the required components. There is a description of developmental objectives, activities that will be conducted to reach these objectives, and dates of completion. One important piece is missing, however. The plan does not include specifics of how the accomplishment of each objective will be measured. Specifically, how will the supervisor know if the administrative assistant has
