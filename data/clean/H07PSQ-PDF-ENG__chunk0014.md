# Align on the Optimal Approach

A second major reason an employee might be making excuses for poor

performance is that they don’t have the skills or knowledge to do what

you ask. If your trepidation is tied to gaps in the person’s capability,

your process must go beyond what they need to achieve and explore

how they’ll achieve it. Depending on your speciﬁc concerns, there are a

few ways to broach this.

When you suspect that the person might take shortcuts or neglect

essential components, get into some detail about the required steps.

Share eﬀective approaches and provide precedents from previous

projects. But don’t make the mistake of doing all the talking; their

nodding head cannot be interpreted as understanding. Instead, ﬁnd out

how they’re processing the request by asking them to share their plan.
