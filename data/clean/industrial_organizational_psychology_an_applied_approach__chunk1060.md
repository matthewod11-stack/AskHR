believes that physical appearance is always a bona fide worker qualification as long as customers and coworkers think that it is. That is, if customers want to be served by beautiful people and coworkers prefer working with beautiful people, then it should be okay for companies to recruit and hire based on an individual’s looks.

When people refer to someone’s “looks” or “physi-

person’s height, weight, and facial symmetry (i.e., high cheekbones vs. no visible cheekbones; small nose vs. big or bulbous nose). Because looks are subjective, beauty really is in the eyes of the beholder. In the United States, as well as other countries, beautiful people are often judged based on their external char- acteristics, rather than such internal characteristics as personality and ability. And it appears that many employers want employees who are tall and strong (for men), small/petitite (for women), with no visible

cal appearance,” they are generally referring to that

body fat, and a handsome or pretty face. Even those HR professionals who know better can often fall into the “looks” trap when recruiting and hiring.

Although some cities have laws against

discrimination of applicants based on their height, weight, and/or physical appearance (e.g., San Francisco, CA; Santa Cruz, CA; Washington, D.C.), basically, there is no real protection from appearance-based discrimination unless it singles out applicants based on race, gender, or age. That is, you don’t have to hire ugly people so long as you aren’t hiring them because of their race, gender, or because they are old.

between looks and wages. The research showed that workers with below average looks earned, on average, 9% less per hour than above average looking workers. Above average looking employees earn 5% more than their average looking coworkers. And Fortune 500 companies seem to hire male CEOs that are about 6 feet tall, which is 3" taller than the average man. Competency and the ability to do the job are often overlooked when emphasis is placed on looks. Although these beautiful people may be able to do the job, there may be less attractive people denied a position who could do the job more successfully.
