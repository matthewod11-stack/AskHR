# Counterproductive Behaviors

As discussed previously, employees who are unhappy with their jobs miss work, are late to work, and quit their jobs at higher rates than employees who are satisfied with their jobs and are committed to the organization. Dissatisfied employees, especially those who are unable to change jobs, also engage in a variety of other counterproductive behaviors in organizations. These counterproductive behaviors can be separated into two types of behaviors: those aimed at individuals and those aimed at the organization (Berry, Ones, & Sackett, ). Behaviors aimed at indi- viduals include gossip, playing negative politics, harassment, incivility, workplace violence, harassment, and bullying. Behaviors aimed at the organization include theft and sabotage. Though such behaviors are not limited to unhappy employees, they provide ways for employees to “get back” at the organization or the coworkers they believe are responsible for their lack of happiness.
