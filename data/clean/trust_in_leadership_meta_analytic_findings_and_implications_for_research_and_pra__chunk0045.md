## Primary Relationships With Hypothesized Antecedents

Nearly all of the variables had statistically significant relation- ships with trust (see Table 2). Transformational leadership had the largest relationship (r (cid:1) .72), followed by perceived organiza- tional support (r (cid:1) .69). Next in magnitude, interactional justice and procedural justice had relationships of similar magnitude (rs (cid:1) .65 and .61, respectively), with transactional leadership and dis- tributive justice having significantly smaller relationships (rs (cid:1) .59 and .50, respectively). PDM had a relatively large relationship (r (cid:1) .46), as did unmet expectations (r (cid:1) (cid:4).40). Propensity to trust had a small significant relationship (r (cid:1) .16). Length of relationship had no appreciable relationship (r (cid:1) (cid:4).01). The relative magnitude of the correlations demonstrates substantial variation in the impact of the variables. Most of the confidence intervals do not overlap, indicating that the correlations are sig- nificantly different from each other.

comes, namely job performance, OCB altruism, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. As predicted, the relationship between trust and job performance (.17 vs. .00), altruism (.22 vs. .07), and job satisfaction (.55 vs. .48) was significantly higher when the referent was a direct leader as opposed to organizational leadership. Also as predicted, the relationship between trust and organizational commitment was higher when the referent was organizational leadership as opposed to a direct leader (.57 vs. .44). As expected, the effect was not significant for turnover intentions.

Referent also moderated the relationship between several ante- cedents and trust. Interactional justice (.77 vs. .43), procedural justice (.66 vs. .53), and PDM (.59 vs. .23) all demonstrated a larger relationship with trust in direct leaders than trust in organi- zational leadership. As expected, perceived organizational support demonstrated a larger relationship with trust in organizational leadership (.75 vs. .56). Referent did not operate as a moderator of the relationship with distributive justice.
