## one-year anniversary at the organization.

We all have scores of decisions to make every day, and we often want

to move quickly, telling ourselves that speed equals eﬃciency. But

true eﬃciency sometimes requires slowing down, being mindful, and

especially looking back at the decisions we’ve made that didn’t go as

we’d hoped.

A mistake is only a mistake if we don’t learn from it. When we

take the time to learn from past decisions, those past regrets and

disappointments become stepping stones to a better future.
