- Don’t be afraid to repeat yourself. During diﬃcult times, people

need to hear your core message many, many times to believe it’s true.

Repetition creates consistency and helps people build trust with the

them up. One CEO Jordan coached posted his three core messages on

his phone to remind him to repeat them in every situation. And one of

Darcy’s clients set up multiple notiﬁcations during the day to keep the

core message top of mind—and to reinforce his own belief that they’d

reach the goals.
