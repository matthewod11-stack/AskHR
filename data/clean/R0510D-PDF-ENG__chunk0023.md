In the following pages, we will describe how the concept of the ofﬁce of strategy manage- ment came into being and how it has helped companies align key management processes to strategy. Although the companies we have studied use the Balanced Scorecard as the framework for their strategy management sys- tems, we believe that the lessons we draw are also applicable to companies that do not use the Balanced Scorecard.

Strategy Management: The New Support Function The exhibit “The Old Strategy Calendar” de- picts the strategy management schedule at a typical large company. The process starts about midway through the ﬁscal year, when the CEO and the executive team get together to clarify their strategic vision and update the strategy. Sometime afterward, similar pro- cesses take place at the business and func- tional units, led by unit heads and other senior executives. Toward the end of the third quar- ter, the ﬁnance function takes the baton, ﬁnal- izing corporate and unit budgets. At the end of the year, the HR function conducts employ- ees’ annual performance reviews and orches- trates the setting of professional goals and de- velopment programs. Throughout the year, meanwhile, different teams and units have en- gaged in performance reviews, corporate com- munication, and knowledge sharing.

The problem with this approach is that the activities are carried out largely in isolation and without guidance from the enterprise strategy. This partition of responsibilities cre- ates the gulf between an organization’s strat- egy and its processes, systems, and people. Sur-

What can companies do to change this state of affairs? The experience of the Chrysler Group ﬁrst suggested to us that the answer lies in bringing all strategy-related activities into a sin- gle functional unit. After a string of innovative successes in the early 1990s, Chrysler had hit a dry spell. Performance problems were exacer- bated by an economic downturn, rising costs, and encroaching imports, and by 2000, the company was staring at a projected deﬁcit of more than $5 billion for the coming year. At this point, the parent company, DaimlerChrysler, appointed a new CEO, Dieter Zetsche, who in- troduced the Balanced Scorecard as part of a major change in strategy. The project was spear- headed by Bill Russo, vice president of business strategy, whose unit worked with Chrysler’s ex- ecutive team to translate the company’s new strategy into a Balanced Scorecard. Russo’s unit also served as trainer and consultant to help Chrysler’s business and support units create local scorecards that were aligned with corpo- rate objectives and customized to local opera- tions. Once the design phase had been com- pleted and scorecards had been cascaded throughout the company, the strategy group maintained responsibility for the data collection and reporting processes for the scorecards.

Up to this point, Chrysler’s Balanced Score- card project had followed a traditional course. Where Chrysler broke new ground was in the roles assumed by the strategy group. The group took the lead in preparing scorecard- related materials to communicate the strat- egy to the more than 90,000 employees. Russo began to brief Zetsche before each management meeting about issues that had been revealed through the scorecard report-
