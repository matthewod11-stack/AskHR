## Figure 5.4 Two positive letters of recommendation with diff erent traits

Second, be honest in providing details. A referee has both an ethical and a legal obligation to provide relevant information about an applicant. A good rule of thumb is to ask, “If I were in the reference seeker’s shoes, what would I need to know?” Of course, deciding what information to provide can often be a difficult process. I was once contacted by a Secret Service agent conducting a reference check on an applicant for a position in a human resources (HR) department. My reservations about the student concerned his excessive use of alcohol in social situations and his negative attitude toward women.

Had the student been an applicant for a posi- tion as an agent, I would have mentioned the drinking. I’m not sure that my decision was correct, but the example demonstrates the dilemma of balancing the duty to provide information to the reference seeker with a duty to treat an applicant fairly.

Finally, let the applicant see your reference before sending it, and give him the chance to decline to use it. Such a procedure is fair to the applicant and reduces the referee’s liability for any defamation charge. Though this last piece of advice seems wise, it can result in some uncomfortable discussions about the content of references that are not positive. After one such discussion, a student told me, “I will get you for this,” even though the reference was never sent because the student declined to use it. Fortunately, after two months of harassment
