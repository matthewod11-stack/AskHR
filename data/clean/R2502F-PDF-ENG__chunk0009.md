 many Asian countries, which are often

more collectivist in their cultures, signiﬁcantly value saving face in negotiation and are willing to make extra eﬀorts to burnish their

reputations. We know of no culture that dislikes being respected, but

Asian negotiators generally put saving face higher on their preference

# list than people from other cultures.

It’s important to recognize that while intentions and cultural rituals

make negotiations harder as they diverge, the reverse happens with preferences. The more preferences diﬀer among negotiators, the easier

it is for them to make deals that create value for both sides. If I value

money and you value time, you can pay me a premium to expedite the

outcome. If I value risk and you value security, you can buy insurance from me. By leveraging diﬀerences in preferences—which are often

more abundant in cross-cultural negotiations—dealmakers may ﬁnd

more ways to increase value for both sides.

To return to the example of saving face, if a negotiator from an Asian

country values saving face in a deal, a counterpart from another culture who values that less could turn the diﬀerence into an equal exchange:

“I appreciate that you value saving face in this deal. I value stability

and predictability. Please let me know how I can help you, and please

share how you can help me so that we can both get what we want.” If you feel that this approach may be too direct, you can oﬀer a selection

of options—some that prioritize saving face and some that do not—and

observe the reaction to gauge your counterpart’s preferences.

No matter how faithfully you try to respect the rules we’ve outlined,

cultural mistakes may still stymie your negotiation. But if you have

honestly and fairly signaled your intentions and charitably interpreted

the intentions of your counterpart, the responsibility won’t be yours.

Nor will it be a problem of cultures clashing. It will be the actions

and agenda of your counterpart that will have sunk the deal. And

that suggests that the problem with the negotiation was less an issue of diﬀerent cultures and more of diﬀerences in the characters and

ambitions of the individuals involved.
