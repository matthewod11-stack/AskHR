cognitive biases. Taking the time to identify particular stressors allows

us to confront mental short-cuts and unhelpful assumptions.

unsuccessful hiring attempts that she wasn’t going to get qualiﬁed

candidates for her role if the organization cast a wide net. She was

convinced the best approach was to narrow the process and “only

interview candidates who have directly applicable qualiﬁcations and

had been in the role before.”

look directly at past mistakes to articulate what went wrong.

Stacey chose to examine the two recent unsuccessful hiring decisions closely. “I learned diﬀerent things from each failure,” she said. In the

ﬁrst case, she had hired someone without relevant industry experience.

“I assumed the candidate would take the initiative to learn the industry

experience,” she said. “He did not do that.” The mistake with her second

hire was that the person “was not direct and communicated poorly.”
