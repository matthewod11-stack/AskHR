# THE GUIDANCE MOVEMENTS

In Boston, the Civic Service House opened in 1901. Funded by Pauline Agassis Shaw, a philanthropist with a strong com- mitment to children, the Civic Service House served the edu- cational needs of immigrant adults. One goal of the Civic Service House was to provide a semblance of a college edu- cation to the working poor of the neighborhood (Brewer, 1942; A. F. Davis & McCree, 1969). Helping in this effort was a frequent guest of the Civic Service House, Boston at- torney Frank Parsons. Well educated and socially minded, he

was an advocate for the rights and needs of those he believed were exploited by industrial monopolies.
