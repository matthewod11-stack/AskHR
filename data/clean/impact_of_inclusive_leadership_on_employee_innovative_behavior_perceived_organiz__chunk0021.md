# Ethics approval

An ethics approval was not required as per institutional guidelines and national laws regula- tions because thereâ€™s no unethical behaviors existing in the research procedures. We just con- ducted questionnaire survey and were exempt from further ethics board approval since our research did not involve human clinical trials or animal experiments. Also, the content of the questionnaire did not involve any sensitive or personal privacy or ethical and moral topics. In the first page of the questionnaire, information on consent procedures was included and par- ticipants were notified that consent was to be obtained by virtue of survey completion. Mean- while, we informed that participants about the objectives of the study and guaranteed their confidentiality and anonymity. The way to fill in the questionnaire is to take out the secret sys- tem, which can further ensure rights of people who answer the questionnaire. All the partici- pants were completely free to join or drop out the survey. Only those who were willing to participate were recruited.
