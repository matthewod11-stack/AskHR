# questions.

- Participate actively: You must engage with the machine in a back-

and-forth interaction. Both parties contribute with feedback and

mutual challenges, and ultimately co-create the output together. To

receive appropriate advice, tailored answers, and helpful suggestions,

start by providing a brief and accurate overview of your situation with

clear context. Then, build on it by engaging actively — share your

reﬂections and personal experiences, and ask follow-up questions.

- Challenge the AI: As in a dialogue with a human, some friction

in the thinking process is valuable. Ask the AI to provide diﬀerent

perspectives, ideas, or overlooked options. Don’t stop at the ﬁrst

generated output or conform too quickly to what the AI gives you. For

example, ask “Are we missing any important aspects?” Or, “What if we

looked at this problem from the point of view of …?”
