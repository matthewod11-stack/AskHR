Ying. In that study workers in a call center were randomly assigned

to do their jobs at home or in the oﬃce. The home-based workers

turned out to be more productive than their oﬃce-based colleagues,

largely because they took fewer breaks and sick days and had a quieter

environment in which to work. They also turned out to be more likely to

stay in their jobs. Nonetheless, after the experiment was over, many of

them decided to return to the oﬃce at least a few days a week, because

they felt isolated and lonely at home and were worried that people in

the oﬃce were getting promotions more often.

In the early days of the pandemic this study gave some support to

advocates for a shift to remote work. But it was a small study with a

narrow focus. Only as the pandemic progressed did it become possible

to consider larger populations, including knowledge workers. And when

Harvard Business School’s Raj Choudhury and other researchers did

so, they found that many workers enjoyed hybrid arrangements. Those

workers were more likely to stay with a company if such arrangements were oﬀered, and at times they delivered greater customer satisfaction

and retention than did their oﬃce-bound counterparts.
