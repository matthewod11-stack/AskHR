Finally, rely on your HSP employee’s insights. HSPs’ heightened

awareness allows them to spot burnout and disengagement. For

example, an HSP may notice when a colleague seems more withdrawn

or may pick up on changes in the tone or energy of team meetings. Don’t

dismiss their concerns — validate and take action before it’s too late.

By recognizing and valuing the contributions of highly sensitive

team members, managers can create a more inclusive and supportive

workplace culture that beneﬁts everyone.
