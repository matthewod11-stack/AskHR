Conclusions This study finds that health care professionals from a Mid-Western region of the USA value the possession and pursuit of cultural knowledge when working with multi-cultural cross-cultural approaches endorsed by staff (e.g., interpreter services) appeared to be enthusiastically supported and were thought to be associated with effectual cross-cultural care. However, the principles of systemic cross-cultural approaches (e.g., cultural competence, cultural safety) were scarcely acknowledged by study participants. The findings indicate a need for interventions that acknow- ledge the value of cultural awareness-based approaches, while also exploring the utility of more comprehensive cultural competence and safety approaches.
