# its mirror neurons.

This mirror system is implicated in understanding the actions of others by partially

activating the same systems within ourselves that would be involved in carrying out

the observed act. AndI should add that there is considerable evidence that the mirror

neuron systems connect to areas responsible for emotions, such as the amygdala.

Those suffering it have difficulty moving their facial muscles. These patients also
