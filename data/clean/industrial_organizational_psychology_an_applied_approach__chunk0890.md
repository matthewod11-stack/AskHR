# What Do You Think? 7

Do you think the legal reasons for these workplace practices outweigh the ethical responsibilities of organizations? Are companies being unfair, and therefore, unethi- cal by engaging in such activities? What are the ethical responsibilities to employees from companies who chose to use such practices? What are some other ethical dilemmas that you think could arise from such practices? Conduct an Internet search on the Genetic Informa- tion Nondiscrimination Act signed by President Bush. Do you think that act is fair to employers and employees? Why or why not?
