# and empathy.

To eﬀectively lead and manage HSPs, managers need to shift their

perspective and recognize that sensitivity is a natural variation in

personality and not a ﬂaw. Rather than viewing sensitivity as a

weakness, consider the strengths your sensitive employees bring to the

table and how they could be applied. For example:

- HSPs are skilled at spotting patterns, reading between the lines, and

picking up on subtle cues, which makes them well-suited to identify

opportunities or risks that others miss.

- Because HSPs are attuned to others’ emotions and needs, they can

be savvy persuaders, inﬂuencers, and negotiators as well as experts at

fostering teamwork and camaraderie.

- HSPs listen to multiple perspectives and ﬁnd common ground, which

can be invaluable during conﬂict resolution.
