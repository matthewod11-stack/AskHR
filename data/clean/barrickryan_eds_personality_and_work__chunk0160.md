# 38 PERSONALITY AND WORK

incorrect. Hertel et al. argued that happy people are more likely to use heuristics to guide behavior (a possibility we discuss in more detail later in the chapter), and apparent cooperation may result from the use of a heuristic in which people simply respond in kind to interaction partners. According to Hertel et al., happy people are more likely to do what their partner is doing, and when their partner is acting cooperatively, the happy person will too. When the partner is acting uncooperatively, the happy person is likely to follow suit. Clearly, more research is needed to determine the ef- fect of happiness on cooperative behavior. Happy people usually do tend to like other people and help other people more than do unhappy people. Thus, it would make sense that happy people are more cooperative as well. However, this may depend on the task they are performing and the speciﬁc behaviors of their interaction partners.

Implications for Work and Productivity Happy workers experience greater social rewards than unhappy work- ers do. They are more likely than unhappy workers to like and be liked by their coworkers, and this greater liking may result in greater helping behavior from the happy worker and toward the happy worker. Thus, worker productivity could beneﬁt from greater hap- piness in at least two types of jobs: (1) those in which pleasant so- cial contact is a direct measure of job performance (for example, in customer service ﬁelds) and (2) those in which high levels of help and cooperation are required for successful performance.

There is some indirect support for each of these hypotheses. For example, Barrick and Mount (1991) found that extraversion (a trait that is moderately to strongly correlated with positive af- fect) is positively correlated with job performance in jobs that re- quire social interaction, and Mount, Barrick, and Stewart (1998) found that extraversion was correlated with performance in jobs that required cooperation. In addition, organizational citizenship behaviors, which often have a social component, may be inﬂu- enced by levels of positive affect (George & Brief, 1992; Organ, 1988), and these behaviors may have important implications for overall organizational effectiveness. In jobs with few social re- quirements, happiness may play less of a role.
