# clear about the end game.

But many leaders change their minds because, even though it might be

frustrating and create more work for you, the circumstances warrant it.

You don’t want to work for a leader who never changes their mind. Good

bosses are willing to try something diﬀerent, chart a new course, or

clean up a misstep. Change comes with the territory of progress. If every

small “edit” is triggering a ﬁght or ﬂight response for you, it’s worth

exploring the root of your reluctance.

. . .

High performers lead up. You have the power to rein in your boss’s

endless ideas and decrease the number of unwelcome pivots.

Bosses who are always changing their minds often fall into that pattern

because they’re creative, enthusiastic, and always want to improve.

Those are excellent qualities in a leader. With intentionality, you can

reap the beneﬁt without paying a never-ending rework price.
