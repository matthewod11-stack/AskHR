## performance psychologist during the 2012 London Olympics, Nicole

Davis, a key member of the team, opened up about the relentless

feedback system that governed her every move as an Olympian: “For

eight years, every ball I’ve touched or didn’t touch, every decision

I made on the court, every hour I showed up in the gym has been

observed and statted. It has been transformed into a measure of my

progress, and my potential to stand on the Olympic podium.” Her life

was a proverbial ﬁshbowl.
