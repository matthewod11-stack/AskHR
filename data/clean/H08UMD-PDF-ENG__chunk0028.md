## Across six experiments with with 4,504 U.S. participants, researchers

tested whether gradually increasing incentives for consecutive work

encouraged them to complete more tasks. In one study the researchers

asked 999 people to imagine that they worked for a food delivery service

and were tired after delivering many items that day. The participants

in one group were told that they’d receive a stable bonus (1.25 times

their usual rate) for every additional delivery they made. People in the

other group were told that their bonus would increase with additional

deliveries (1.15 times for one more, 1.20 for two, and 1.25 for the third

and any subsequent delivery after that). When asked to predict how

many extra deliveries they’d make before taking a break, participants

in the second group said they’d make signiﬁcantly more deliveries than

those in the stable bonus condition did.

In another experiment the researchers gave 423 participants the option

of decoding CAPTCHA images for small amounts of money or watching

funny videos for no money. Half the participants were oﬀered a stable

incentive for decoding each CAPTCHA. The other half were oﬀered

increasing incentives, but if they took a break and watched a video, their

reward would reset to a low rate and they’d have to build it up again.

The researchers then asked the participants how committed they felt

to the goal of maximizing their earnings and recorded how many tasks

they chose to complete before taking a break. Those in the increasing

incentives condition completed the most tasks, took the fewest breaks,

and reported the highest level of commitment to their goal.
