## Organizations should know their people: A behavioral economics approach — 42/48

pany or the boss, in the sense of having similar attributes (Sackett and Walmsley 2014). In this commentary, we make a case for experimental tools used in behavioral economics to complement these extensively-used measurements of peo- ple’s attitudes within organizations 2. We consider that such an approach, while sharing some of the inherent limitations of workers’ assessments (e.g. how to encourage employees to participate, self-selection issues, etc.), offers a number of advantages that deserve exploration.

Nowadays it is possible, for instance, to systematically assess the intertemporal, risk and social preferences of a large number of individuals quite easily, while also keeping a rela- tively high level of control over external confounding factors. Applying these procedures within companies allows managers to classify people into categories such as short-run/long-run oriented, risk averse/seeker, loss averse, cooperative or egal- itarian. Being able to classify people is a value in itself for companies and these measures can be used in a similar fashion as more traditional ones – i.e., to predict performance, to hire persons who ﬁt the team or the boss, etc.

Moreover, these classiﬁcations are based on measures (typically given by numerical values) which are fairly com- parable across individuals. Instead of asking someone how forward looking or risk seeking she is, behavioral measures rely on real decisions that reveal the decision maker’s true preferences. Even if we abstract from the obvious inﬂuence that factors such as socially-desirable responding and self- misrepresentation may exert on self-reported measures 3, the interpersonal comparability of such measures is also compro- mised by the subjective perception of respondents about what levels of a particular personal attribute can be considered low, medium or high. Peer assessments are not free of these biases either. Behavioral measures, on the other hand, are able to provide economically meaningful values (or ranges of values) based on formal models. For example, the annual subjective discount factor of worker A has been estimated to be between 0.94 and 0.95, whereas for worker B it is estimated to be in the 0.97-0.98 range. The discount factor is a measure of the relative importance the individual gives to later versus sooner rewards and is therefore economically meaningful and inter- personally comparable. In the case of the example, we can infer that worker B is more patient or long-run oriented than worker A (more precisely, she values rewards that will be re- ceived one year later 2-4% more than worker A). This means that worker A and worker B could differ in their response to a particular incentive scheme if the associated rewards/penalties are sufﬁciently delayed: therefore, worker A should be of- fered incentives with shorter realization times in order to reach

2 For reviews and discussions on the relationship of behavioral eco- nomics measures with cognitive and non-cognitive personality measures, see Borghans et al. (2008), Almlund et al. (2011), and Becker et al. (2012) 3 Please note that behavioral measures based on choices with real con- sequences reduce these biases with respect to traditional techniques such as surveys or personality self-reports but cannot completely avoid them. This is particularly important in the context of organizations given that responses can be observed by managers and this might affect the employees’ choices.

the same motivation level as worker B (the exact preference values obtained offer valuable quantitative information that can be used to calibrate the appropriate incentives for each worker). Similarly applies to other behavioral economics mea- sures such as those assessing risk or social preferences. Please see the section “Practical applications of basic insights” for potential practical uses of the information obtained.

Measurement and its robustness In the typical tasks/games of behavioral economics experi- ments, the individual is asked to make decisions over different outcomes involving real monetary stakes. For instance, to elicit someone’s discount factor, the individual typically faces a series of decision problems of the form, “do you prefer re- ceiving $100 today or $104 in month? The option you choose will be implemented for real and you will receive the money (at the particular date) speciﬁed in it”. The advantages of monetary stakes compared to other types of experimental re- wards have been discussed in depth and are nowadays broadly accepted (see Camerer and Hogarth (1999) and Read (2005), for meaningful discussions). Real monetary incentives are of course costly to implement but there are ways in which one can get a good cost-beneﬁt balance, for instance, through the use of probabilistic rewards (e.g. Exadaktylos et al. (2013)). In addition, technology makes it now possible to pay partic- ipants using mobile phone apps that protect personal data, which simpliﬁes the procedure. It is true, however, that the use of real monetary incentives in some assessment projects can be problematic, especially in those involving hiring new employees.

Also, in the context of real organizations, experimental tasks/games must be easy but meaningful with the objective of minimizing complexity while maximizing the quality of the information gathered. There are several reasons why as- sessments should not be very long. These include preserving respondents’ engagement in the task (too long/complex tasks might be boring and exhausting) and avoiding contamination between participants if the assessment length requires a break during which participants can communicate to each other.

Two fundamental concepts here are “validity” and “reli- ability”. It is true that the validity of behavioral economics measures to explain behavior and performance in the work- place needs yet to be evaluated more deeply. Although there is increasing interest, research addressing the capacity of these measures to predict job behaviors and performance is still in its infancy. Since in contrast to cognitive ability and personal- ity measures (e.g. Sackett and Walmsley (2014), Schmidt and Hunter (2004)), there is a lack of meta-analytical evidence of the validity of behavioral measures in the world of work, predictions often have to be built on individual studies. A number of independent studies have indeed found evidence of the predictive validity of intertemporal, risk and social pref- erences measures in this context (Barr and Serneels (2009), Carpenter and Seki (2011), Fehr and Leibbrandt (2011), Burks et al. (2012, 2016), Leibbrandt (2012), Fouarge et al. (2014),
