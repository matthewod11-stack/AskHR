## The Origins of the Process-Based Approach in Spearman’s Principles of Cognition

Although some psychologists in the nineteenth century were interested in information processing (e.g., Donders, 1868/ 1869), the connection between information processing and intelligence seems ﬁrst to have been explicitly drawn by Charles Spearman (1923), the same individual known for ini- tiating serious psychometric theorizing about intelligence.

Spearman (1923) proposed what he believed to be three fundamental qualitative principles of cognition. The ﬁrst, ap- prehension of experience, is what today might be called the encoding of stimuli (see R. J. Sternberg, 1977). It involves perceiving the stimuli and their properties. The second prin- ciple, eduction of relations, is what today might be labeled in- ference. It is the inferring of a relation between two or more concepts. The third principle, eduction of correlates, is what today might be called application. It is the application of an

inferred rule to a new situation. For example, in the analogy WHITE : BLACK :: GOOD : ?, apprehension of experience would involve reading each of the terms. Eduction of rela- tions would involve inferring the relation between WHITE and BLACK. And eduction of correlates would involve ap- plying the inferred relation to complete the analogy with BAD. Tests that measure these attributes without contamina- tion from many other sources, such as the Raven Progressive Matrices tests, generally provide very good measures of psychometric g.
