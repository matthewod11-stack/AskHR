# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 253

both the learning goals and self-regulation in achieving those goals in order to “manage their learning and make it more ﬂexible so they can achieve whatever seems most appropriate in each situation” (p. 570).

As a ﬁnal example, Harackiewicz, Barron, Carter, Lehto, and Elliot (1997) examined the short- and long-term consequences of student achievement goals during college. Consistent with a multiple-goal perspective, both mastery and performance goals had positive and complementary effects on different measures of academic success. In particular, they found that mastery goals in the short run predicted interest in an introduction to psychology course, and in the long run they predicted the number of subsequent psychology courses students enrolled in. Performance goals pre- dicted both short- and long-term academic performance.

These three studies show the need to consider multiple goals within training research. The studies also are consistent with calls by Snow (1992) to understand how constructs work together in the light of learning outcomes, as opposed to studying a number of learning and motivational constructs in isolation from one another. In particular, the multiple-goal idea implies that a single interven- tion to induce a mastery orientation may not always be appropriate or realistic. Instead, we need a better understanding about motiva- tional traits such as goal orientation and a focus on what combi- nation of interventions may be needed to create an effective and longer-lasting learning state.

The idea of multiple pathways can certainly be applied to other personality traits that have relevance for learning beyond goal ori- entation. For example, training research indicates that high inter- nal locus-of-control individuals tend to be more motivated to learn and learn more than those low on internal locus of control or high on external locus of control. Research is needed that goes beyond these simple effects to address the question of when or under what conditions external locus of control is adaptive rather than mal- adaptive. In addition, investigators can begin to examine the multi- ple pathways that lead some externals to positive learning outcomes. Finally, prior to recommending appropriate interventions to create a learning state such as state mastery orientation, investiga- tors might want to focus more attention on affecting learning processes. For example, efforts could be directed toward having
