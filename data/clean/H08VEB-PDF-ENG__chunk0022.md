# Normalize

Leaders who normalize emotional expression—both the positive and the diﬃcult—help build teams that are more creative, eﬀective at

solving problems, and resilient. When you model emotional honesty in

a grounded and intentional way, it signals safety and builds trust.

This does not mean baring your soul. In fact, oversharing can

undermine your credibility and destabilize your team. The goal is to

show a little humanity and demonstrate that having a full range of

emotions is normal and allowed.
