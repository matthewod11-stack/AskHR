# Employee Rights

U.S. workers have the right not to have foreign crewmembers on prevailing practice D-visas perform longshore work during a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute. Also, the performance of the longshore work by foreign crewmembers must not

be intended to inﬂuence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in the local port. The employer must provide notice

of the ﬁling of an attestation to longshore workers employed at the local port. Any aggrieved person or organization (including

bargaining representatives in the local port) may ﬁle a complaint alleging a misrepresentation on an attestation or a failure to comply with its terms.

Under the State of Alaska exception, an employer must make a bona ﬁde request for, and employ U.S. workers who are qualiﬁed

and available in suﬃcient numbers to perform the longshore work. Only where suﬃcient U.S. longshore workers are not made

available may the employer use alien crewmembers to perform the work.
