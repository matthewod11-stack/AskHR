# The law and Termination

Employers are utilizing the employment at-will doctrine to terminate employees at

any, time for reasons and no reason. Based off this doctrine, it is permissible for an

employer to terminate without any fear oflegal action from the employee. If the employee

files a lawsuit, based on wrongful termination, the employer can feel assured that the

employee will not prevail. The fundamental argument from the employer would be the at

will employment status of said employee. In conjunction with, it is their business and they

may terminate employees as long as no laws have been violated. On the other hand, the

employee perspective is different, and he/she may view the termination of their

employment as unfair. Just because an employer's action is unfair in the eyes of the

employee does constitute wrongful discharge, perhaps bad policy or judgment. When the

employment at-will doctrine has come before courts, both sides have won, employer and

employee. If the employer has the prerogative to terminate at-will, then the question is,

why are such cases being lost?
