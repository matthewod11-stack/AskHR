# At-Will Employment

"This doctrine embraces a rule declaring that employment for an indefinite term

may be terminated at any time for any reason by either the employer or the employee

without any legal liability" (Aalberts, Gaston & Seidman, 1993). The origin and or source

of this doctrine remains obscure even to those who deal with at will employees and those

29

who write on the subject. By 1877 the at-will employment doctrine was generally

accepted in American courts. "'It is generally assumed that the at-will rule was the result

of an evolution in the master-servant relationship forced by industrialization in the

nineteenth century'' (Aalberts et al., 1993). In addition, employment oflarge number of

employees by ever-growing powerful employers insisted on new employment standards

that needed to accommodate new economic conditions (Aalberts et al., 1993).
