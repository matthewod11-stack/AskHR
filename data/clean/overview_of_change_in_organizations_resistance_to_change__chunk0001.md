# Abstract

Global economy continues to influence the way in which companies carry out their business more and more. Therefore, the current business environment, impacted by globalization, has forced these organizations to manage change in an effective and efficient manner, and change management has become one of the key management skills in organizations.

In this context, change management is an essential component in company success, which is why

the literature describing the success initiatives of change management is increasingly extensive.

The topics most studied in the literature imply resistance to change, employees’ readiness for change, leadership effectiveness, employees’ involvement, participation and commitment in change processes, and the roles and skills required for the success implementation of organizational change. The purpose of this study is to present two major topics discussed in the literature, namely,

resistance to change and employees’ readiness for change.

Key words: change, change management, resistance to change, readiness for change J.E.L. classification: M10, M12, M19

- 1. Introduction

We must prepare for “the future that has already happened”, according to the statement of the management theoretician Peter Drucker (Kinicki & Williams, 2020, p.376). There are super trends that specifically shape the future of business (Kinicki & Williams, 2020, p.376):

- “The market is becoming more segmented and oriented towards niche products”: in the recent past, managers could think in mass market terms - mass communication, mass behaviour and mass values. Nowadays, we are facing a “demassification” process, the client groups being broken down into smaller and more specialized units and responding to commercial messages directed in a more restricted manner. Such marketing messages can even be modelled and customized through artificial intelligence, allowing robots, for example, to engage in conversations with individual consumers or with small consumer groups. Some suggest that this type of customer-oriented marketing can help create relationships leading to customer loyalty and repeat business.

- “The competitors providing specialized solutions are steering the faster launch of products on the market”: companies that need too much time to make their products available for sale may not succeed in using a narrow window of opportunity before their competitors.

- “Know-how rather than information is the new competitive advantage”: since information technology covers more of the work previously performed by humans, even in high technology sectors, many employees formerly considered “knowledge workers” are now recognized as “data workers”.

Change involves the dismantling or restructuring of organizational structures, hierarchies, culture and strategies to facilitate new flexible work models which will accommodate the potential issues arising out of resistance to change (Awoke, 2020).
