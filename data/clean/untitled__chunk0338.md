# The School Psychologist

We have already noted that the origins of school psychology lie in the psychological clinic of Lightner Witmer. Thomas Fagan (1992) has written that:

School psychology was one of many child-saving services orig- inating in the period of 1890 to 1920. . . . [I]t originated in response to compulsory schooling, which provided the stage for development of separate special educational programs for atypi- cal children. School psychology emerged in the middle of the child study movement. (p. 241)

The child study work of Hall focused attention on a broad spectrum of child behavior and education. Many of Hall’s master’s and doctoral students at Clark University worked in what could be described as school psychology, includ- ing three particularly inﬂuential pioneers: Henry Herbert Goddard (1866–1957), Lewis Terman (1877–1956), and Arnold Gesell (1880–1961).

Goddard was employed at the New Jersey Training School for Feebleminded Girls and Boys in Vineland when he began his research on mental retardation, searching for better tools for intellectual assessment and for methods of effective education and training of mentally handicapped children. Goddard was frustrated in his work at Vineland using the measurement tools he had learned at Clark University and from Cattell’s work. Whereas those tools seemed appropriate for assessment of children of normal intelligence, they were not useful for the children at Vineland. In a 1908 trip to Europe, Goddard learned of a new approach to intelligence testing developed by French psychologist Alfred Binet (1857–1911). Goddard translated the test for English- language use, tested it on samples of public school children as well as the students at the Vineland Training School, and published his version of the test in 1909. Its popularity as an instrument of intellectual assessment spread rapidly, culmi- nating in the version published by Terman in 1916 that be- came known as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test.
