# The Radical Behaviorism of B. F. Skinner

Burrhus Frederick Skinner (1904–1990) questioned whether theories of learning were necessary in view of what appeared to be fruitless theoretical tests (Skinner, 1950). He argued in- stead for a purely empirical description of behavior, eschew- ing any hypothetical or intervening nonobservable variable in his description of behavior, a position that he had estab- lished in his ﬁrst major publication (Skinner, 1938). His ma- nipulation of the contingency between an operant (emitted) behavior and a reinforcer constituted his program of re- search, carried out in the operant-conditioning chamber more popularly known as a “Skinner Box.” With rats and later pigeons as his experimental subjects, Skinner measured cu- mulative responses over elapsed time as a function of rein- forcement schedules (Ferster & Skinner, 1957). Intervening variables, such as drive or motivation, were deﬁned opera- tionally in terms of number of hours of deprivation or percent of free-feeding body weight. The reports of experiments by Skinner and his followers, with few animals but a large num- ber of responses, met with rejection from editors whose deﬁnition of an experiment required a research design com- paring experimental and control groups with a statistical test of the signiﬁcance of the difference between them. The result was the establishment of the Journal for the Experimental
