## them for positive or negative sentiment, and extract key themes. Similar

to performance-enhancing sneakers, in this case AI can accelerate

an analyst’s capabilities in the moment, while still allowing for their

human judgment, curiosity, and creativity to be applied.

On the most desirable end of the spectrum, AI-powered tools can be

used like a coach that improves people’s own capabilities. Consider

an IT professional who is studying to pass a certiﬁcation test for a

new, complex system. An LLM that has been trained on the system’s

documentation could interactively generate practice questions as the

professional gains competence and provide personalized feedback as it

teaches advanced concepts. Ultimately this would help the professional

stretch their understanding of the subject matter and develop new skills

that last beyond just the time spent using the AI-powered tutor.

Our own research has shown similar beneﬁts for learning new math

concepts. In a randomized experiment we ran online, we found

that giving people access to LLM-based explanations while practicing

standardized test problems led to sizable improvements in their ability

to later solve similar test problems on their own. Much like a sports

coach, AI tools that teach could potentially provide both short and long-
