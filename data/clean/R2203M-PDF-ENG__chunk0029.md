# Recently, at a global company where

a friend of mine works, an ethnically Chinese woman who was born in America and had never lived in China was hired to lead its business in that country. The decision was tough and came after the company had passed over several local candidates. But the woman departed within two years. She had been hampered by her inability to speak proper Mandarin or to relate to her team and external partners. The company ended up replacing her with someone internal.

That is the risk I see with choosing Catherine. I believe that she’s talented and smart enough to recognize the importance of embracing the Chinese

culture and immersing herself in it, but the initial disconnect will be hard for her to overcome. Nolan, on the other hand, gets China. He has put tremen- dous eﬀort into learning the language and has spent a total of 17 years with feet on the ground in the region. It’s obvious to me that he would have a better chance of success in the role.

That is no doubt part of the reason

why John is in favor of hiring Nolan, though adding diversity to his Asia team is his main consideration. Alex and Jackie should pay attention to his opinion.

They should also remember that diversity involves much more than visi- ble diﬀerences such as gender and race. Educational background, professional knowledge, personality type, thinking style, and life experience are factors as well, and Nolan’s proﬁle suggests that he would be able to serve as a bridge between the Chinese team and head- quarters, helping to translate issues for both sides.

That said, Juno’s leaders still need to address the lack of diversity at the com- pany as a whole, especially as it relates to gender—an issue that cuts across regions. Given the underrepresentation of women at senior levels, they should take immediate and concrete action, such as inviting some women of color to become independent board directors. They should also work on improving their systems and processes so that they have a sustainable plan for hiring and promoting more women.

Alex is lucky to have a choice between two great candidates. From my perspective, Nolan would be best suited to the Asia role, and Alex can easily make that case to the board and the rest of the organization. Perhaps, as the company seeks to become more diverse, there will be another, better, spot for Catherine.
