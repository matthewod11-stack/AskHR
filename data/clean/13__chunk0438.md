considering any sort of human resource intervention. While certainly prediction is valuable for selection decisions, the purpose of many human resource interventions is to affect employee performance. Research on job performance over time has the potential to beneﬁt many varied ﬁelds of human resources.

It should be recalled that much of the early work on dynamic performance stemmed from a concern about job performance. In particular, researchers considered the implications of dynamic perfor- mance for the validity of various selection devices. While the question of whether performance is dynamic has been resolved, the implications of this dynamism are still unknown. Research is needed into the validity of selection devices for predicting both initial performance levels and performance curves. The nature of this predictability should also be evaluated to improve decision-making. When performance was assumed to be static, decision- making with selection devices was simple: higher scores were better. However, there are likely to be tradeoffs when considering selection devices in a longitudinal context. How does one compare the utility of a device with high initial predictability but poor predictability in terms of performance trends, with a device with poor initial predictability but high validity for predicting performance trends?
