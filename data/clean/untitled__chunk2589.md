Education is discipline for the adventure of life: research is in- tellectual adventure; and the universities should be homes for adventure shared in common by young and old. For successful education, there must always be a certain freshness in the knowl- edge dealt with. It must be either new in itself or it must be invested with some novelty of application to the new world of new times. Knowledge does not keep any better than ﬁsh. (Whitehead, 1929/1952, p. 106)

Since the ﬁrst undergraduate course of study at Harvard College in 1636, American higher education faculties have pursued Whitehead’s vision. During the past 100 years, psy- chology has become one of the most popular pathways for this adventure. In 1996–1997, 74,191 baccalaureates and 4,053 doctoral degrees were awarded in psychology, 6.3% and 8.8%, respectively, of the total number of degrees awarded at these levels (Almanac, 2000). This chapter exam- ines the evolution of undergraduate psychology, ﬁrst as a body of knowledge implicit in courses and curricula and sec- ond as explicit learning outcomes that faculty expected of constantly changing student populations.

We chose the “three-legged stool of faculty activity” metaphor to organize the chapter: teaching, scholarship, and service. The section on teaching is a historical review of the changing courses and degree requirements of the undergrad- uate psychology curriculum. The section on scholarship ana- lyzes how faculty identiﬁed and assessed speciﬁc learning outcomes. In the section on service, we discuss how psychol- ogists educated each other and public audiences about their pedagogy. In a concluding section, we suggest a number of issues on the horizon, yet to be navigated in the new century.
