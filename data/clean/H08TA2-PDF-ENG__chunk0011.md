Decision repackaging

Executives waste valuable time repeating, translating, or defending

decisions made privately. This not only slows momentumâ€”it breeds

misalignment and friction downstream. Trust erodes over time, and

leaders become conditioned to use their 1:1s to game the system and

distort the truth to ensure their views prevail.
