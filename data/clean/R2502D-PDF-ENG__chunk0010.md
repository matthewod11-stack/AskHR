# later its CEO).

Ford, Hastings, and Buﬀett achieved breakthroughs by creatively

combining prior innovations. From our experience helping student-

entrepreneurs launch startups and CEOs innovate their strategies, we’ve

perfected a method of unlocking this powerful source of innovation:

precedents thinking. It involves three steps. First, frame your challenge

and its key elements. Next, search for previous innovations—precedents

—relevant to each element. Finally, combine some or all of those

precedents—in part or in whole—to generate your best ideas. This is

what Albert Einstein called “combinatory play.”

In practice each step can be revisited multiple times in light of learning

from subsequent steps. You iterate through this process until your

intuition tells you that you have a breakthrough that will work.
