My own understanding of gender is as follows. Based on the argumentation of Scott (1986), I see gender as a constitutive element of social relationships based on perceived differences between the sexes. We, as humans, construct gender by ourselves in our everyday lives. Further, it shapes everyday behaviour of men and women by having an impact on their interactions. As with any type of relationship, gender may benefit some groups of people and harm others. It indicates and articulates the distribution of power (Scott, 1986).
