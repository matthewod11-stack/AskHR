## 3.2.1. Organisational support and antecedents

The variables that were used to build the organisational support and antecedent construct

were drawn from the works of Salinero and Muñoz (2007) and Chand and Katou (2007). The

results of the exploratory factor analysis are as follows. The first variable of this factor is “Are

individual training and development needs analysed?” This variable has a weight of 0.756. The

second variable is “Does the company attempt to improve the skills and knowledge of

employees?”, and the weight of the factor is 0.718. The third variable is “Are coaching and

training plans essential for the company?” The weight of the factor for this variable is 0.641.

The fourth variable is “Does this process occur regularly?”, with a weight of 0.757. The fifth

variable, “Does the number of coaching programmes increase every year?”, has a weight of

0.692. The sixth variable is “Does the company have a detailed written training plan?”, with a

weight of 0.782. Finally, the seventh variable is “Does the company evaluate the results of the

process?”, with a weight of 0.707. The variance explained by the seven variables is 52.281,

and the value of the KMO test is 0.888. The reliability of this scale is α=0.772, and r=0.791.
