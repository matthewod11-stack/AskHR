## 3.2 Measurement scales: dimensionality and validity

We designed a questionnaire on the basis of the literature review to obtain the information that

we needed to resolve our research problems. In the development of the variable measurement

scales, we used previous works as a reference and adapted the content to the specifics of our

research. A group of experts then examined the different scale items to verify their suitability.

With regard to the individual construct reliability, we first used the Cronbachâ€™s alpha coefficient

and the composite reliability index of each construct. Second, to confirm the dimensionality of

the scales, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis to examine the suitability of the

groupings of variables around the corresponding dimensions. Finally, we verified the validity

using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of each construct.
