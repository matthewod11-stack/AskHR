6 We have also observed a fourth decision type: ad hoc. These decisions arise episodically, and their impact depends on how concentrated they

are. In this survey, we did not ask about this decision type, because ad hoc decisions are circumstantial by nature and vary too greatly.

Decision making in the age of urgency

This is not so surprising, given that cross-cutting decisions are broad in their scope and impact, and are made frequently. But even at the top, C-level executives and senior managers report the greatest exposure to cross-cutting decisions (Exhibit 2). By contrast, middle managers say they are most familiar with delegated decisions and least so with big bets.

One of the survey’s most noteworthy insights is how much time decision making really consumes. On average, just over half of respondents report spending more than 30 percent of their working

time on decision making, and more than one-quarter spend a majority of their time making decisions. That share of time increases with seniority; for example, 14 percent of C-suite respondents say they spend more than 70 percent of their time making decisions. Even so, many respondents say this time is not well spent—and this inefficiency is an expensive problem (see sidebar “The potential costs of ineffective decision making: A thought experiment”). On average, 61 percent say most of their decision-making time is used ineffectively. Among C-levels, 57 percent say the same.
