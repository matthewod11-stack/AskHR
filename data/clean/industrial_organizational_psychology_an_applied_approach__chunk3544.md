# Change Management

In today’s business world, change is inevitable.

Changes in technology occur almost every day (or so it seems). Newer and better companies spring up, forcing other organizations to re-evaluate how they do business and to do what’s necessary in order to remain competitive or become more so. Fluctuations in the economy also cause change, as companies find ways to

deal with lower profit margins. This may mean mergers, downsizing, re-organizations, or even bankruptcies. Whatever the cause for the change, as you read in this chapter, change must be well planned, well managed, and well executed in order to be ethical and successful. Many companies, when making decisions for change, operate under the philosophy of “the ends

will justify the means.” The “ends” is the result that the company wants from the change. The “means” is the action taken in order to achieve those results. Critics interpret this philosophy as suggesting that a good result excuses any wrongs committed to attain it. This, they say, is unethical because no excuses are acceptable for committing any wrongs. In the controversial situation of first testing new drugs on animals, critics say that the ends do not justify the means. It is wrong to harm any living being, whether animal or human.

Proponents of animal testing, however, say

that whenever implementing any change in an organization, the cost must be weighed against the result. Sometimes a few must be hurt for the good of society. In the example of drug testing on animals, proponents of the philosophy would say that the ends do justify the means because it is done for the good of society: The successful development of important life-saving drugs justifies testing the drugs on animals. Following are two situations. After reading them,

answer the questions under “What do you think?” Situation A: A small consulting firm was struggling to survive after 9/11. The company got most of its revenue from doing supervisory trainings and other human resources consulting. Almost all organizations within and outside of the United States were financially impacted by 9/11. One of the first places that companies cut back was in their training budget. So, the consulting firm had to make some changes in order to survive or else they would go bankrupt and many people would be out of work. The company operated under the “ends justify the means” philosophy: their goal was to increase revenue and in order to do that, they had to make changes that negatively impacted on some employees. This is what they did: Employees were no longer reimbursed for mileage, no matter how far they had to go to provide consulting services. All employees had to pay for their own airfare if they had to travel out of state or the country. All employees had to take one week off without pay, regardless of whether they were salaried or wage employees. The company had a wellness program where they paid for the membership fees for all employees. The company no longer paid the membership. If the employees wanted to continue going, they had to pay the membership themselves.

By taking these steps, the company was able

to save a significant amount of money over the

next few years. In the past two years, they have been able to give small salary increases to employees. Situation B: A large manufacturing company, in an effort to reduce turnover and thereby increase productivity and revenue, decided to make a major organizational change: it was going to decentralize its decision making. Decentralizing is when a company allows each department to make decisions on that department’s product, service, and budget. When it was centralized, all decisions went through the CEO and her administrators. Departments had to complete a lot of paperwork and often would have to wait weeks to get a decision on something as simple as which applicant to hire for a particular position. This caused a lot of stress and bad feelings, which led to managers and their employees quitting, often without notice. With decentralization, departments could recruit, interview, and select its personnel; prepare yearly budgets; make decisions on purchases for the department and staff; and take disciplinary actions—all without checking with the CEO or administrative staff. The thought of the company was that this increased decision-making power would make managers and their employees more willing to stay with the company. This, in turn, would help increase profits.

One manager was excited about this change in management style. She would finally be able to do some things that she thought would help increase the profitability of her department, and subsequently, the entire company. She felt that the more profitable the company was, the better it would be for all employees. So, after being empowered to make more decisions on her own, she decided to fire the department secretary. Although the secretary had been with the company for eight years and had done a good job, it was the manager’s opinion that she was not attractive enough. One of the duties of the secretary was to give a sales pitch to potential customers who came in and asked about the company’s products. The manager believed the department would get more customers with an attractive secretary waiting on them because the customers would be more willing to listen to a sales pitch from an attractive person rather than an unattractive one.
