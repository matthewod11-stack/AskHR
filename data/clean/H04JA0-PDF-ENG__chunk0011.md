for political behavior at work. In one study, the researchers go as far as

describing oﬃce politics as a “white man’s game.” Based on a review of

the existing literature, this study ﬁnds that mentoring and networking

are indeed critical to developing political understanding. Women and racial minorities did not diﬀer from white men on their self-reported

levels of networking and mentoring; however, only white men beneﬁted

from these activities. It seems even if women and racial minorities

engage in political behaviors, they may not beneﬁt from them in the

same way that white men do.

The reason for this is that political behaviors are considered a more

stereotypical image for white men, and therefore the beneﬁts will be

selectively applied to white men who choose to engage in them. In

the research undertaken by Kate Davey in 2008, women described

oﬃce politics as an informal system that keeps power with those

who have it, while excluding those who don’t. In this study, women’s

descriptions of career barriers were in fact descriptions of political

barriers. Subsequent research has borne this out: Even though women

and racial minorities understand the political environment, they may

not gain the advantages white men do by engaging in it.
