# What Makes an Ally?

Many people identify as an ally, but what is it that allies do? What behaviors should allies perform and what processes should they go through in order to show that they are true allies and that this is not just an empty title? Many scholars and prac- titioners have discussed this question and have offered multiple ideas, but there is no one agreed-upon set of behaviors; instead, different authors offer multiple sug- gestions for what allies do that are not in conflict with each other but instead add to each other to form a full picture of allyship. After reviewing the previous litera- ture, we suggest that allyship behaviors and processes can be thought of as three broad categories: knowledge and awareness, communication and confrontation, and action and advocacy.
