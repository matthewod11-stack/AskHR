Here, the arrival of graph neural networks (GNNs) o(cid:2646)ers a robust solution to predict employee turnover [4–6]. Unlike standard mod- els, GNNs are capable of representing and processing relational data through the use of graph structures. (cid:2399)ey can capture the complex relations between employees that could provide valuable information towards improving prediction accuracy.
