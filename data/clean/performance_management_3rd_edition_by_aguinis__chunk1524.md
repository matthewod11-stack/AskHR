Not all coaches perform all the coaching functions by engaging in all of the behaviors described here. Managers who do so, of course, are highly effective. In fact, some have become legendary leaders. Consider Table 9.1, which summarizes the critical functions served by coaching and the behaviors coaches used to perform these functions. For example, take the case of Jack Welch who was extremely dedi- cated to developing his employees by engaging in several of the coaching behaviors described here when he was CEO of General Electric (GE).14 To get involved with his employees, Welch spoke during a class held at a three-week developmental course for GE’s high-potential managers.

He set performance targets and monitored them throughout the year. Each year the operating heads of GE’s 12 businesses received individual two-page, handwritten notes about their performance. Welch attached the previous year’s comments to the new reviews with comments in the margin about the progress made by the individual managers toward his goal or the work that he still needed to do to reach the goal. Then, he distributed bonuses and reiterated the goals for the upcoming year. This process cascaded throughout the
