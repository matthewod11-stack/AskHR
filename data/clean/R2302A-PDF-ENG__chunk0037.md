# strategizing and team building.

In some areas we follow the same best practices that other thoughtful

companies do. For example, we work with team members to create a

formal career and growth plan. That helps even the most far-ﬂung to

feel safely tethered. In other managerial realms we are establishing new

standards. Consider team meetings. Most of ours last 25 minutes, which

forces greater eﬃciency. Notes are taken collaboratively in real time in

a Google Doc, which helps clarify and record the resulting action items

while giving people who couldn’t attend greater insight into what they

missed. We’ve distilled these and many other ideas into something we

call “TeamOps” and have made it public as a guide for any organization

—remote, hybrid, or colocated—that’s looking to improve and speed up

its collaborative decision-making and execution. Since October 2022 we have also oﬀered a TeamOps certiﬁcation externally.

As more knowledge-work companies consider how they want to operate

in a post-Covid world, it’s been surprising to see so many insisting

that employees return to an oﬃce, either full- or part-time, despite the

widespread productivity jumps that occurred during lockdowns.
