Picture yourself ﬁlling out a job application online. You arrive at a

question asking you to provide some demographic information, like

your gender or race. Although several response options are provided,

you notice that your own identity group is not included in the list.

At this point in the process, how would you feel about this potential

employer? Would you expect to feel a sense of belonging if hired?
