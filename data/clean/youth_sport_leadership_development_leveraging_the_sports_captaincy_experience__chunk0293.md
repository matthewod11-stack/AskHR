# IMPLICATIONS FOR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE

To this point, we have provided an abundance of information on how we have approached leadership development through sport. In sharing our phi- losophy as well as our biggest successes and challenges, our hope is to bring attention to this very important but under-acknowledged life skill. As sport consultants, it appears commonplace to address issues of conÔ¨Ådence, focus, motivation, team building, and communication with our athletes and teams. Fewer have addressed performance enhancement from a leadership- building perspective. After all, we are only beginning to develop models, research initiatives, and guidelines for doing so, as previously illustrated. In addition to addressing leadership development with athletes and teams, conducting statewide programs for high school athletics is another possible source of consulting revenue.
