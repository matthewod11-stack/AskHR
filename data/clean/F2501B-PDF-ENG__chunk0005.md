## Anderson, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University

of California, Berkeley, reinforces this view: It found that people’s

perceptions of their own status in groups tend to be very accurate and

that individuals seek out a higher rank only if they believe they can

provide more value to a group. We would expect, therefore, that more-

competent people would have greater leadership ambition. But when we

considered how many incompetent people end up running companies,

schools, even countries, we realized, “Yeah, maybe leadership ambition

is not a perfectly eﬃcient predictor of competence.”

HBR: When incompetent people rise to levels that they can’t handle, doesn’t the organization give them that feedback?

Established research dating back to the 1960s shows that humans seek

out positive feedback and avoid and rationalize negative feedback. We

also are reluctant to give people bad news; instead of giving it to people

straight, we sugarcoat it. In the workplace, this leaves many employees

with an inﬂated sense of their own abilities—which might convince

them that they belong in a leadership role. Such misperceptions are

often compounded by what is called motivated reasoning: Leadership

roles come with large increases in compensation, autonomy, and status,

and the desire for those things can cause people to arrive at conclusions

about themselves that may not be accurate.
