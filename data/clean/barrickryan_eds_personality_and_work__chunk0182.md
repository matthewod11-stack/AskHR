# Novelty and Complexity

For jobs that require novel responses, the happy worker may be able to synthesize information quickly and develop creative new strategies that can have a positive impact on productivity and per- formance. For complex and mentally challenging jobs, happy workers may be more likely to ignore irrelevant material and to use effective heuristics to simplify tasks. This should result in more ef- Ô¨Åcient strategies and higher productivity. Less happy workers may be slower and more careful, resulting in an inability to make deci- sions and the use of overly cautious strategies.
