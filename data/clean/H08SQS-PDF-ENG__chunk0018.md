## Among all of our participants, about a third oﬀered pin-point

predictions in their initial estimates (meaning they oﬀered ﬁgures with

one or more decimals) which previous research has established as an

indicator of overconﬁdence. What surprised us was that after consulting

with peers or ChatGPT, participants’ overconﬁdence in the accuracy of

their forecasts systematically changed.

Conversing with ChatGPT signiﬁcantly increased the participants’

tendency to oﬀer pin-point predictions, while participants in the peer

discussion group became signiﬁcantly less likely to use pinpoints in

their revised estimate. In other words, their overconﬁdence decreased.
