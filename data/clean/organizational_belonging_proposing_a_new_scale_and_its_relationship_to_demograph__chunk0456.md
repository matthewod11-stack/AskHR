# Overall results

Most important was finding initial support for four distinct reliable and valid OB scales – Be Myself, Acceptance, Diversity Valued, and Connection. These scales are new to the OB literature and were primarily based on combining prior quantitative (e.g., Hagerty & Patusky, 1995; Stamper & Masterson, 2002) and qualitative (e.g., Belle et al., 2015; Herbert, 2020) studies, with support from a content analysis of open item responses from a small validation sample. Once establishing these scales, other important results included: (1) showing several demographic differences on these OB scales; (2) finding that all four OB scales were significantly positively corre- lated with productivity and intent to stay variables; and (3) when these OB scales competed against each other (in the final step of the regression anal- yses), showing the significant impact of Be Myself on productivity and Acceptance on intent to stay, after first controlling for demographic and then organizational variables.

Finding high mean levels for all four OB scales speaks well for the organizational cultures of both Companies A and B. Follow-up t-tests showed that males were significantly higher on two of the four scales, i.e., Acceptance and Diversity Valued. There were no significant differen- ces on any OB scale race, Christians had higher perceived Connection than non-Christians, and management level employees per- ceived higher Be Myself and Connection than non-management employ- ees. It may be easier to “speak freely” when you have more authority. The diverse t-test and regression results add to the credibility of OB scale distinctiveness.
