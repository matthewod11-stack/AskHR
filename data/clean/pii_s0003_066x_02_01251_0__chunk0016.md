## A Research Agenda for Industrial and Organizational Psychologists

Each of the following sections identifies traditional prac- tices, new developments, and research questions that re- quire attention if the field is to lead organizational change rather than react to it. These sections are job analysis, employee selection, training and development, perfor- — mance appraisal, compensation (including incentives), and organization development. Admittedly, these areas represent only some of the broad range of activities that psychologists are engaged in and that relate to the man- agement of people in work settings. In total, however, they comprise much of the work in this area.

Job Analysis: Identifying the Work to Be Done and the Personal Characteristics Necessary to Do the Work

Traditional task-based “jobs” were once packaged into clusters of similar tasks and assigned to specialist workers.

Today, many firms have no reason to package work that

way. Instead, they are unbundling tasks into broader chunks of work that change over time. Such shifting clus- ters of tasks make it difficult to define a job, at least in the traditional sense. Practices such as flex time, job shar- ing, and telecommuting, not to mention temporary workers, part-timers, and consultants, have compounded the definitional problem.

Job analysis is a common activity of industrial and organizational psychologists, and there exists a well-de-

931

fined technology for doing such analysis (Gael, 1988; Harvey, 1991; Ilgen & Hollenbeck, 1991; McCormick, 1979). Terms such as job element, task, duty, position, job, job description, and job family are well-understood parts of the lexicon of industrial and organizational psy- chologists everywhere.

Today, however, there is a detectable shift away from a task-based toward a process-based organization of work. A process is a collection of activities (such as procurement, order fulfillment, product development, or credit issu- ance) that takes one or more kinds of input and creates an output that is of value to a customer (M. Hammer & Champy, 1993). Customers may be internal or external. Individual tasks are important parts of the process, but the process itself cuts across organizational boundaries and traditional functions, such as engineering, produc- tion, marketing, and finance.

Consider credit issuance as an example. Instead of the separate jobs of credit checker and pricer, the two may be combined into one “deal structurer.” Such in- tegrated processes cut response time and increase effi- ciency and productivity. Bell Atlantic created a “case team’’—a group of people who have among them all of the skills necessary to handle an installation order. Mem- bers of the team—who previously were located in different departments and in different geographical areas—were brought together into a single unit and given total re- sponsibility for installing the equipment. Such a process operates, on average, ten times faster than the assembly line version it replaces. Bell Atlantic, for example, reduced the time it takes to install a high-speed digital service link from 30 days to 3 (M. Hammer & Champy, 1993).

Employees involved in the process are responsible for ensuring that customers’ requirements are met on time and with no defects, and they are empowered to experi- ment in ways that will cut cycle time and reduce costs. Result: Less supervision is needed, while workers take on broader responsibilities and a wider purview of activities. Moreover, the kinds of activities that each worker does are likely to shift over time.

in terms of traditional job analysis, this leaves many unanswered questions and a number of challenges. Some of these questions follow.

What will be the future of traditional task-based de- scriptions of jobs and job activities? Should other types of descriptors replace task statements that describe what a worker does, to what or whom, why, and how? Will “task cluster” statements or “subprocess” statements be- come the basic building blocks for describing work? What does a job description look like in a process-based or- ganization of work? Will job specifications (which identify the personal characteristics--knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics—necessary to do the work) su- persede job descriptions? Does identification of the en- vironmental, contextual, and social dimensions of work become more important in a process-based structure? Will emphasis shift from describing jobs to describing roles?

Managers often look to industrial and organizational psychologists to help them analyze jobs and describe work processes as a foundation for other human resource man- agement activities, such as employee selection, training, compensation, work and organization design, and per- formance appraisal. In the next section, I discuss the im- plications of the new organization of work for employee selection.
