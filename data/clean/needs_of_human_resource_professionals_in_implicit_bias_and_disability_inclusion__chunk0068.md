strategies (i.e., internship programs, trial employment, special interviewing process, for- profit job placement, disability inclusion and diversity policies, and working with state vocational rehabilitation agencies and community-based rehabilitation organizations to build a disability-inclusive talent pipeline) that were associated with employment of people with disabilities in the workplace, which further emphasizes the importance of disability inclusion strategies in disability bias training.

Chan and colleagues (2021) conducted a systematic literature review of the disability- employment literature, a focus group with employers, and a follow-up Delphi study with members of the focus group and identified 33 disability inclusion policy items. Results indicated disability inclusion policies and practices can be grouped into two major domains: (a) leadership/executive management level disability inclusion policies and practices (Level 1) and (b) middle-managers, supervisors, and staff level disability inclusion practices (Level 2). Level 1 practices represent leadership/executive’s commitments and efforts to influence down and across the organization to drive behavior change by communicating their strongest commitments and provide the infrastructure and resources needed to foster a disability inclusion workplace culture. Conversely, Level 2 practices have a focus on the implementation of disability inclusion policies and practices by mid-level managers and staff to increase employment rates of people with disabilities. Practices include collecting data and reporting progress toward hiring persons with disabilities to senior management, establishing a paid internship program for high school and college students with disabilities, partnering with state vocational rehabilitation agencies and community- based rehabilitation and health organizations to recruit qualified individuals with disabilities, developing strategies to include persons with disabilities in the company’s talent pipeline, and including disability inclusion training in the new employees onboarding process. Chan et al.’s (2021) study represents the most exhaustive set of empirically supported disability inclusion policies and practices and is consistent with the current findings highlighting the importance of disability inclusion strategies in disability bias training for HR managers.
