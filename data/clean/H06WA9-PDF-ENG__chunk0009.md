## With ﬁve generations together in U.S. workplaces for the ﬁrst time

(Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z),

and similar dynamics playing out in other parts of the world, tensions

are mounting. The anger and lack of trust they can cause hurt team

performance by limiting collaboration, sparking emotional conﬂict, and

leading to higher employee turnover and lower team performance.

And a lack of awareness and understanding of age issues can drive

discrimination in hiring and promotion, leading to lawsuit risks.

But many organizations don’t take steps to address generational issues.

While companies have recently renewed their diversity eﬀorts, only

8% of organizations include age as part of their DEI strategy. And of

organizations that do address it, the strategy has often been to simply

encourage those of diﬀerent generations to focus on their similarities or

to deny the reality of their diﬀerences altogether.

This is a missed opportunity. Age-diverse teams are valuable because

they bring together people with complementary abilities, skills,

information, and networks. If managed eﬀectively, they can oﬀer better

decision-making, more-productive collaboration, and improved overall

performance — but only if members are willing to share and learn

from their diﬀerences. Think of a multigenerational team of product

developers, merging the seasoned experience and broad client network
