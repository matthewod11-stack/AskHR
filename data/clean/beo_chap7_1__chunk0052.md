# 7.2.6.1 Hindsight Bias

The brain’s tremendous ability to sense patterns is manifested by our tendency to

rapidly rewrite our memories of the past to fit what we have learned. The problem is

that revising our beliefs after an event naturally leads to misremembering how little

we knew before the event. Rapid rewriting creates “hindsight bias”—the ex post

recollection of the ex ante probability of an event will be biased in the direction of

the event’s realization. Hindsight bias is on display every day in sports commentary

and news coverage. It is surely an important force in organizational life but has not

been studied at all.

A simple way to think about hindsight bias in agency models is that the effort

an agent exerts narrows down the distribution of some relevant variable v at time f,

9;(v). Suppose the agent’s job is to make the best decision given the value of v,

which will eventually have a public realization v*. A principal who creates an ex post “recollection” of the ex ante variance based on the realized v*, E; [o,(v)] =

E,4,lo;(v) | v*], will infer too much mass around v*. Suppose the agent did not

choose the optimal action conditional on v*. Then the principal will (mistakenly)

infer that the agent did not exert enough effort to narrow the variance o;(v) (he

“should have known”). If the optimal action conditional on v* is what the agent

actually chose, then the agent gets too little credit because the principal will recall the likelihood of v* occurring as being obvious (i.e., E, [o;(v)] will be too closely

centered around v*, and the principal will not be impressed that the agent figured

out that v* would happen).

This sketch of a model becomes more interesting if agents anticipate that prin-

cipals will be hindsight-biased. Agents who anticipate being second-guessed will

record as much ex ante evidence as they can (also known as “covering your ass”).

Agents may also herd into the same decisions other agents make (see Zwiebel 1995)

or seek other ways to avoid anticipated hindsight bias.

It would be very useful to have field evidence distinguishing the effects of hind-

sight bias from other distortions. One method is to compare behavior of owner-

managed firms with similar firms where shareholders and boards can second-guess

the managers. Hindsight bias should be lower and risk-taking higher among owner-
