## ADA Compliance, Legal, and Ethical Implications

The ADA mandates reasonable accommodations and proh ibits disability-based discrimination in hiring, extending compliance requirements to AI -powered tools (Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as gal standards due to amended, n.d.). However, scholars argue AI hiring tools frequently violate these le opaque decision -making and lack of regulatory oversight (Paez, 2021; Sheard, 2022). The lack of transparency in AI hiring tools has significant legal and ethical impli cations as candidates and regulators struggle to challenge potentially discriminatory outcomes or hold employers accountable for violations Derek Mobley v. Workday illustrate how proprietary (Vogel et al., 2024). For example, lawsuits like algorithms disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities, a s well as other marginalized groups, highlighting the urgent need for regulatory intervention (Derek Mobley v. Workday Inc., 2024).

To address these shortcomings, scholars advocate for the adoption of explainable AI (XAI) and independent bias audits. XAI systems enhance interpretability by explaining how hiring managers make decisi ons, promoting fairness, and enabling candidates to understand their evaluations (Hickman et al., 2024; Hofeditz et al., 2022). However, XAI has limitations in hiring contexts, as even transparent explanations cannot fully eliminate bias if the underlying training data or algorith ms are flawed (Packin, 2021). Policy developments such as Illinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act and New York City’s Bias Audit Law represent early efforts to regulate AI hiring tools by requiring applicant consent, audits, and increased transparency (820 ILCS 42/, n.d.; NYC Bias Audit Law, n.d.). At the global level, the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act provides a comprehensive regulatory framework that emphasizes accountability and inclusivity, which could serve as a model for enhancing ADA compliance in the United States (AI Act, 2024). Despite these advancements, the ethical and legal challenges posed by AI hiring systems remain significant, underscoring the importance of proactive measures , such as bias audits, inclusive design, and human oversight, to ensure AI hiring practices align with legal and ethical standards.
