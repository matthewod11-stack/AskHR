A company’s big challenge with innovation is seldom the volume of

ideas. Indeed, in a survey conducted this year by my company, only

6% of corporate innovators said that their biggest problem was having

too few ideas. But not all ideas are equal, and poor or highly derivative

ideas might consume far too much attention. Frequently those ideas are

related to emerging trends, involve more than the company can do on

its own, require nurturing, and are cross-functional in nature. The real

need is to ensure that the right ideas get ahead and get considered.
