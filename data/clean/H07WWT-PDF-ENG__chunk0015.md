Clarify what you’re being asked to do.

In his mind, the presentations my client Jacob was asked to make

would require him to spend several evenings designing a fat deck of

detailed PowerPoint slides. But as we began to talk through next steps,

he realized he was jumping into action without clarifying the need.

Most of us aren’t experts in the art of making requests. Jacob’s leaders

were no exception. When he took a moment to clarify the scope of the

request, Jacob uncovered that the need could be satisﬁed by sharing an

existing report and scheduling a more planful, deep-dive overview of

the full-year results in January. What would have been an after-hours

slog turned into a simple, less-stressful solution.

When you get a last-minute request, don’t hesitate to ask more

questions to understand the problem your leaders want you to solve

— and their reasons why it needs to be done now.
