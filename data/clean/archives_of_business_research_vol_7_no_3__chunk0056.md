In Table 6, the entire coefficient values, t values, p values and values for the indirect effect are given for each variable. In the coefficient values, the highest value is for managing talent, which is 0.1459. It means the contribution and the changes due to the managing talent in the employee performance behavior are almost 15 %. The t-value, which shows the individual testability of retention management (RT) is 3.1386, which is highest than any other variable. The P value, which shows the significance, is more significant for the managing talent (MT). In the indirect effect, the highest value in all variables is for managing talent, which shows that there is almost 11 % effect of managing talent on the employee performance behavior. According to the above results, in the four talent management strategies the best suitable strategy is managing talent (MT), because it has large contribution in the effect on employee performance behavior and its indirect effect on the employee performance behavior is also up to 11% with the 2.6759 t-value.

DISCUSSION The aim of this study is to examine the impact of talent management strategies on employee performance behavior and how these talent management strategies plays its role through the talent management outputs which leads towards the employee performance behavior. The results indicate the confirmation of the hypothesized relationship. The results of the study are in conformity with earlier studies (Kahn, 2010; Rich, LePine, & Crawford, 2010; Sageer, Rafat, & Agarwal, 2012; Bakka, 2006). The newness of this study lies in its empirical testing to examine the relationship between the talent management strategies and employee performance behavior. Hence the study positively contributes towards existing body of knowledge. The study also provides opportunities to managers and practitioners to initiate appropriate interventions strategies to attract and retain the talents for positive performance behavior resulting into organizational competitiveness. The study has limitations of small sample size, based on limited number of organizations, and cross section nature of the research. The choice of sample is likely to limit the generalizability of the findings. Future research should be based on random sampling and the longitudinal approach is recommended.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION AND FUTURE STUDIES In changing environment of uncertainty, performance and sustainability of the organization is vital. Proactive identification of organizationsâ€™ talent and its subsequent nourishment and development provide requisite stimulus for positive attitude towards work, co-workers, customers, and organizations. This positive attitude transforms in tangible performance behavior of employees that is vital for organizational survival in competitive environment. Organizations need to plan innovative talent management strategies enabling employees to demonstrate positive attitudes and behavior that would enable organization to achieve sustainable success.
