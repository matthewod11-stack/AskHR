## In RenDanHeYi, employees group together in microenterprises, which

can range in size from ﬁve to 20 employees, to innovate around speciﬁc

opportunities or challenges. GEA, for example, launched 14 MEs while

its parent, Haier, is organized into thousands.

Our quantitative research showed that ﬁrms that adopt this type of

organizational model were able to unleash greater entrepreneurial

behavior (1.5x), achieve better ﬁnancial performance relative to peers

(1.3x), and were better at recruiting and retaining top talent (1.2x). When

a group of Haier employees saw an opportunity to provide a one stop

cooking solution for consumers, for example, they banded together

to form their own microenterprise. The resulting Internet of Food

microenterprise now covers everything from designing and installing

“smart” cookers and fridges that recognize their owners, to providing

precisely timed recipes and allowing users to interact with each other
