## Chapter 9 • Performance Management Skills

found that less than 20% of employees reported that their performance reviews helped them improve their performance. Overall, the majority of respondents reported being dis- satisfied with the level of feedback and frequency of performance reviews from managers.46 Because supervisors play these paradoxical roles, it is usually helpful to separate the various meetings related to performance. Separating the meetings also minimizes the possibility of negative surprises.47 Moreover, when meetings are separated, it is easier to separate the discussion of rewards from the discussion about future career development. This allows employees to give their full attention to each issue, one at a time.

Chapter 6 noted that performance management systems can involve as many as six formal meetings. Each of these sessions should be seen as a work meeting with specific goal, including the following:

- System inauguration. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss how the performance management system works, which requirements and responsibilities rest primarily on the employee, and which rest primarily on the supervisor.

- Self-appraisal. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the self-appraisal prepared by the employee.

- Classical performance review. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss employee performance, including the perspectives of both the supervisor and the employee. • Merit/salary review. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss what, if any, compensation changes will result from the employee’s performance during this period.

- Developmental plan. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the employee’s developmental needs and what steps will be taken so that performance will be improved during the following period.

- Objective setting. The purpose of this meeting is to set performance goals that are both behavior and results oriented for the following review period.

Although six types of meetings are possible, not all six take place as separate meetings. For example, the self-appraisal, classical performance review, merit/salary review, developmental plan, and objective setting meetings may all take place during one umbrella meeting labeled “performance review meeting.” As noted above, however, it is better to separate the various types of information discussed so that the employee and supervisor focus on each of the components separately. Note, however, that the conversa- tion about compensation should be related to performance (i.e., employees must under- stand the direct link between performance and compensation decisions).

Regardless of the specific type of meeting, there are several steps that must be taken before the meeting takes place. Specifically, it is useful to give at least a two-week advance notice to the employee to inform her of the purpose of the meeting and enable her to pre- pare for it. Also, it is useful to block out sufficient time for the meeting and arrange to meet in a private location without interruptions. Taking these steps sends a clear message that the meeting is important and that, consequently, performance management is important. As noted above, most organizations merge several meetings into one labeled “performance review meeting.” The typical sequence of events for such a meeting is the following:48

- Explain the purpose of the meeting. The first step includes a description of the pur- pose of the meeting and the topics to be discussed.
