# Cartesian Dualism and the Veil of Ideas

For psychology, the most important modern thinker was René Descartes (1596–1650), who created an inﬂuential framework for thinking about cognition that was funda- mental to the history of psychology for the next 350 years. Descartes’dualism of body and soul is well known, but it also included the new scientiﬁc distinction of physical and mental worlds. Descartes assumed living bodies were complex ma- chines no different from the world-machine. Animals lacked

soul and consciousness and were therefore incapable of cog- nition. As machines, they responded to the world, but they could not think about it. Human beings were animals, too, but inside their mechanical body dwelled the soul, possessor of consciousness. Consciousness was the New World of ideas, indirectly representing the material objects encountered by the senses of the body. Descartes’ picture has been aptly called the Cartesian Theater (Dennett, 1991): The soul sits inside the body and views the world as on a theater screen, a veil of ideas interposed between knowing self and known world.

Within the Cartesian framework, one could adopt two atti- tudes toward experience. The ﬁrst attitude was that of natural science. Scientists continued to think of ideas as partial reﬂections of the physical world. Primary properties corre- sponded to reality; secondary ones did not, and science dealt only with the former. However, the existence of a world of ideas separate from the world of things invited exploration of this New World, as explorers were then exploring the New World of the Western Hemisphere. The method of natural science was observation. Exploring the New World of Consciousness demanded a new method, introspection. One could examine ideas as such, not as projections from the world outside, but as objects in the subjective world of consciousness.

Psychology was created by introspection, reﬂecting on the screen of consciousness. The natural scientist inspects the objective natural world of physical objects; the psychologist introspects the subjective mental world of ideas. To psychol- ogists was given the problem of explaining whence sec- ondary properties come. If color does not exist in the world, why and how do we see color? Descartes also made psychol- ogy important for philosophy and science. For them to dis- cover the nature of material reality, it became vital to sort out what parts of experience were objective and what parts were subjective chimeras of consciousness. From now on, the psy- chology of cognition became the basis for epistemology. In order to know what people can and ought to know, it became important to study how people actually do know. But these investigations issued in a crisis when it became uncertain that people know—in the traditional Classical sense—anything at all.
