# citation.

Employees may not contest citations, amendments to citations, penalties, or lack of penalties. They may

contest the time allowed in the citation for abatement of a hazardous condition. They also may contest an employer's Petition for Modiﬁcation of Abatement (PMA), which requests an extension of the abatement

period. Employees who wish to contest the PMA must do so within 10 working days of its posting or within 10

working days after an authorized employee representative has received a copy.

Within 15 working days of the employer's receipt of the citation, the employer may submit a written objection

to OSHA. If the PMA requests an abatement date that is two years or less from the issuance date of the citation, the Area Director has the authority to approve or object to the petition.

Any PMA requesting an abatement date that is more than two years from the issuance date of the citation

requires the approval of the Regional Administrator as well as the Area Director. If the PMA is approved, the

Area Director shall notify the employer and the employee representatives by letter.

The Area Director or Regional Administrator (as appropriate), after consultation with the Regional Solicitor's Oﬃce, shall object to a PMA where the evidence supports non-approval (e.g., employer has taken no

meaningful abatement action at all or has otherwise exhibited bad faith). In such cases, all relevant

documentation shall be sent to the Review Commission in accordance with Â§1903.14a(d). Both the employer

and the employee representatives shall be notiﬁed of this action by letter, with return receipt requested.

Letters notifying the employer or employee representative of the objection shall be mailed on the same date that the agency objection to the PMA is sent to the Review Commission.

Employees may request an informal conference with OSHA to discuss any issues raised by an inspection,

citation, notice of proposed penalty, or the employer's notice of intention to contest.

Informal conferences: When issued a citation or notice of a proposed penalty, an employer may request an

informal conference with OSHA's Area Director to discuss the case. Employee representatives may be invited to attend the meeting. To avoid prolonged legal disputes, the Area Director is authorized to enter into

settlement agreements that may revise citations and penalties.

Notice of contest: If the employer decides to contest the citation, the time set for abatement or the proposed

penalty, he or she has 15 working days from the time the citation and proposed penalty are received in which

to notify the OSHA Area Director in writing. An orally expressed disagreement will not suﬃce. This written notiﬁcation is called a "Notice of Contest." There is no speciﬁc format for the Notice of Contest. However, it

must clearly identify the employer's basis for contesting the citation, notice of proposed penalty, abatement

period, or notiﬁcation of failure to correct violations. To better identify the scope of the contest, it also should

identify the inspection number and citation number(s) being contested.
