Is 11 points a good choice? Reichheld has not explained why the question was developed with 0–10 scale. There is a long debate among researchers of how many points the scale should have. Five points is believed to be enough for gen- eral questions12. Most of the research found by the author of this text suggest using scales consisting from 5 to 7 point. Of course, it must be kept in mind the purpose of the survey, the content of the question itself, and the statistical op- erations to be undertaken. Fortunately, it is not a decision for a lifetime, and in many cases a procedure of rescaling can be used13. Another issue is that fully labeling the scale (which is not the case in the NPS) is believed to bring positive impact on research quality14.

Criticism of the NPS There is as much enthusiasm in the business world15 as criticism about the NPS in science. First, there is no agreement on the fact that the NPS is the most impor- tant and only indicator to measure16 as Reichheld was implying originally. Sec- ondly, many researchers failed to replicate original results and therefore found the
