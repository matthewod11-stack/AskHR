- 5. Asia-Paciﬁc is the second- largest market for toys and games in the world, and some 75% of all toys are produced in mainland China.

- 6. In 2021 expats made up about 10% of Hong Kong’s population of 7.5 million.

- 7. How should a multinational company go about creating a deﬁnition of diversity that works across a global context?

context, and she couldn’t read or write Mandarin ﬂuently. John had pointed out that she’d have a team of Chinese nationals who could translate when necessary. But he acknowledged that it would highlight her American- ness, which might hinder her.

NOLAN BENNETT Nolan, a white man, was also American, having grown up in Texas. But he had spent almost as much time in Asia as in the United States. After high school he’d lived in Beijing for two years as part of a volunteer program. He’d told Alex that those two years were both exhilarating and transformative for him, changing the course of his life and career.

Nolan learned to speak, read, and write Mandarin ﬂuently and immersed himself in the culture. He returned home to study at the University of Texas at Austin

and decided to double-major in Chinese and business adminis- tration with a view to eventually returning to the country that had captured his imagination. Right after college he accepted a job at a global toy company and within three years seized an opportunity to relocate to Hong Kong, where he split his time between the city and facilities in mainland China.5 That was 15 years ago, and he’d become a huge asset to his employer. He was one of the few foreigners in the manufac- turing space who was ﬂuent in Mandarin.

Nolan had also built relation-

ships. Factory managers and other stakeholders appreciated his language capability, cultural understanding, and trustwor- thiness. Over time he’d amassed a good amount of social capi- tal—what the Chinese refer to as guanxi—which was important for

getting things done. He and his partner, a Hong Kong native, con- sidered the city home and were raising two daughters there.6

Nolan loved his current job, but he was excited about Juno’s growth potential. Alex wondered, though, whether he could take the Asia business to the next level, since his references consid- ered him more of an “operations guy” than a visionary leader.

CONTEXT MATTERS “What did Stuart think?” Jackie asked Alex the day after his lunch with the chairman. They were in her oﬃce at Juno headquarters. “He asked a lot of questions but didn’t really show his cards,” Alex said. “I think he gets how tough a call this is going to be. He said the board will take my recommendation—but they’re expecting me to prioritize diversity.”
