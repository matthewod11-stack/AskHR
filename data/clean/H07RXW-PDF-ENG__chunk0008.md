as air conditioning, refrigerators and microwaves — could translate into

a competitive position for the company to sell AC units, refrigerators,

and other appliances into the RV market. They had created what

small, autonomous business unit, comprised of a handful of internal

entrepreneurs, who are able to take action on ideas they are passionate

This approach is just one of many examples of decentralized

organizational models that GEA, and a growing number of other

companies, are adopting — models that run in direct conﬂict with the
