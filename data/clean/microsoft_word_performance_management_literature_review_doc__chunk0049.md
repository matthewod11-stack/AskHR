training and development before the link to pay is made, as the definitions and measures need to be robust once pay is being influenced.

(cid:1) ‘Do it properly or don’t do it at all’, that is, if there is a fear that development may be compromised or pay progression limited then the pay link should not be attempted; correspondingly if the links are made, there should be robust assessment in place that genuinely tests whether or not individuals have obtained and are using the defined skills in their workplace.

But since its early introduction, reward specialists, organisational psychologists and academics have disputed whether or not PRP is an effective motivational tool.
