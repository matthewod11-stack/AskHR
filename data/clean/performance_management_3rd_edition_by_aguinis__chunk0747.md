higher than 95% of other employees. On the other hand, HR has been placed around the 48th percentile, meaning that about 52% of employees are performing better than him.

A fifth comparison method is called forced distribution. In this type of system, employees are apportioned according to an approximately normal distribution. For example, 20% of employees must be classified as exceeding expectations, 70% must be classified as meeting expectations, and 10% must be classified as not meeting expectations. General Electric (GE) is one organization that has adopted a forced distribution system. Former GE CEO Jack Welch labeled GE’s forced distribution system the “vitality curve.” In his view, forced ranking enables managers to manage low-achieving performers better. GE’s success in implementing a forced ranking system is cited as the model by many of the 20% of U.S. companies that have adopted it in recent years. At GE, each year 10% of managers are assigned the “C” grade, and if they don’t improve they are asked to leave the company.16

What are some of the advantages of using comparative measurement methods? First, these types of measurement procedures are usually easy to explain. Second, deci- sions resulting from these types of systems are fairly straightforward: it is easy to see which employees are where in the distributions. Third, they tend to control several
