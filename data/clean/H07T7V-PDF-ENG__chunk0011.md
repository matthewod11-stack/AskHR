The patron saint of geeks is probably Maria Montessori, who about 100

years ago got obsessed with the problem of how you educate young

children best, and came up with the Montessori educational method,

which is this radical departure from the industrial scale model of

schools that was dominant then, and sadly still dominant now. Think

about Maria Montessori when you think about a geek.

ADI IGNATIUS:
