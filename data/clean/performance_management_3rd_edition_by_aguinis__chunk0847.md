Superior performance of skill; ability to train others

BARS use graphic rating scales that use critical incidents as anchors.29 BARS improve on the graphic rating scales by first having a group of employees identify all of the important dimensions of a job. Then, another group of employees generates critical incidents illustrating low, average, and high skills of performance for each dimension.

They must match the critical inci- dents with the correct dimensions. Finally, a group of judges assigns a scale value to each incident. Consider the following BARS for measuring job knowledge:
