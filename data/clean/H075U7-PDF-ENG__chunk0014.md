# oﬀender.

When a woman is interrupted, dismissed, made to feel incompetent,

sexually harassed, and subsequently decides to share her experiences,

it is too often that men — more often than women — respond with

invalidating statements. In our experience, these may include, “I’m sure

he didn’t mean anything by that,” “Oh, but he has daughters,” “Oh, but

he mentors women all the time,” “He ﬂirts with everyone,” and “It’s not

a big deal; you’re being too sensitive.” Men often are given a pass on

harassing behavior with statements like, “He doesn’t know any better,”

or “Things were diﬀerent when he was in training.” Referring to a man’s

character or older age as a get out of jail free card robs the opportunity to

help him overcome a blind spot in his leadership.

Each of these commonly related sentiments challenge the legitimacy of

the woman’s experience. As bad as these phrases are, they actually pale

in comparison to “He’s a good guy.” This phrase inherently deﬂects the

conversation to the perpetrator’s character, implying that a good man in

other contexts could only have intended good behavior in this particular

situation. Vouching for a man’s goodness also disarms the victim and

undermines a woman’s ability to hold the harasser accountable.

A second problem with the “good guy” defense is that it prevents

accountability for the oﬀender, while perpetuating a misogynistic

culture in which women feel devalued and unsafe. Motivations for dismissing a colleague’s behavior include reluctance to have diﬃcult

conversations with repeat oﬀenders, discomfort acknowledging that a

good colleague has behaved inappropriately or illegally, fear of violating

sexist workplace norms, or even anxiety. Calling out this behavior
