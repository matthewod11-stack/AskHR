# Relationship and personal ties

Our findings further suggest that indigenous managers are often unwilling to sever workplace

and family ties. Such ties are seen to offer institutional support and security beyond the

workplace. For many of the informants, terminating the employment of underperforming

workers is seen as severing ties with the person. Therefore, the emotional burdens that can

befall the person lead to persistence with the employee in the face of the evidence. Some of

the informants noted that they have often sidestepped the decision to weed out such workers

to maintain their personal and family relationships. We further observed that Ghanaian and

Nigerian societies are collectivist in nature and as such workers or employees tend to develop

“strongly knitted social ties and feel a sense of obligation to their kith and kin” (Mmieh et al.,

2011, p. 424; Jackson, 2004). These networks of ties in relationships then influence firm

behaviour and managers’ freedom to act.

“I also think personal relationships make it difficult to fire incompetent employees.” (N33)

The analysis of interview data suggests that the paternal culture by which employers

treat employees as their children was highlighted by a number of the respondents as a key

factor that led to retention of underperforming employees in the Nigerian environment. The

16

pull towards personal wellbeing, which typifies the paternal culture, overrides corporate

interest and objectives. Informants who work for entrepreneurial organisations were

unanimous in pointing to family ties between owners and some employees as the cause of

retention of underperforming employees. An informant who owns a travel agency (N41) said

she retains underperforming employees who are family members because she would still

meet their financial needs if they were sacked, stressing that “in Nigeria, you are your

brother’s keeper”. She also pointed to honesty and loyalty as trade-off for job performance in

her organisation. As another informant elaborated:

“Every time we tried to sack him (elderly worker) he brought up stories of his family. In the

end, we kept him with new duties.” (G17)

As Mmieh et al. (2011, p. 424) put it,

“The Ghanaian worker extends the institutional cultural traits of high esteem to authority,

hierarchy, acceptance of status differentials, and respect for elders and positions in the

workplace … managers/elders in position are expected to exercise constraint in reprimanding

and/or weeding out underperforming workers in the workplace.”

One of the informants specifically emphasised the effect of the drive to maintain relationships

which has resulted in retaining an ineffective sick employee for over two years in his

organisation. He said:

“This employee is being retained despite the fact that the period specified in the extant

employment rules for light duties has been exceeded and he is supposed to be retired.”(N40).

The complexities characterising this issue in many Sub-Saharan African countries is

also captured by Ovadje and Ankomah (2001, p. 184) who noted that often an employee

facing disciplinary action could direct a delegation of elders encompassing cultural and local

potentates to the home of the line manager or supervisor to plead on behalf of the ‘victim’ as

well as remind him or her of the potential “economic and social damage the impending

17

disciplinary action will do to the person’s family (both immediate and extended), kinsmen,
