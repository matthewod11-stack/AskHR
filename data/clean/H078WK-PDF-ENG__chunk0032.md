Weaver stated in a 2020 interview:

You had this interesting friendship and bond that was created during

the most racially divided time in our nation’s history. Now, to bring

the names of those two people together to help solve [problems] now is

the most rewarding thing I have ever done in my life, hands down.

I think the beauty of companies that began in the last few years have

the opportunity to let today’s standard for DEI be the foundation

they’re being built upon. Ten years from now, this conversation looks

very different because we have solid foundations being built right

now and that has never been the case before now.

One eﬀect of her eﬀorts, Weaver has noticed, is how intentional

diversity creates lasting, familial friendships among people with remarkably diﬀerent life experiences.

“I saw a quote recently that said something like, Company culture isn’t

buying a beer keg, it’s creating a culture in which people want to have

a beer together. Our team members go out of their way just to hang

out. We have an annual summit, and it will be like a big giant family

reunion. And it’s not because we’re doing things to make it feel that way.

Literally, just people walking through the doors are going to feel that

way. This company culture is unique, and I’m not confused about what

we’ve built. It’s special.”
