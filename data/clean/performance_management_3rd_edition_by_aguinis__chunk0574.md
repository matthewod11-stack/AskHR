# Dilbert’s Mission Statement Generator

Please visit Dilbert’s Web page and play the “mission statement generator” game (http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/ games/career/bin/ms.cgi). Generate two different mission state- ments and provide a critique of the resulting statements based on whether they comply with the characteristics of an ideal statement. Because generated statements will vary, please also provide a critique of the following statement: “We strive to con- tinually administrate timely opportunities and enthusiastically

utilize enterprise-wide technology while promoting personal em- ployee growth.” In addition, answer the following questions:

- 1. What are the dangers of having a flawed mission statement?

- 2. How does a flawed statement affect the development of a unit’s mission statement and subsequent individ- ual job descriptions and goals? (cid:2)
