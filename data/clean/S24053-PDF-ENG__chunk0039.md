# priorities for the year.

Building cohesion was also a key priority. After the oﬀ-site, the team

began every meeting with a “team moment” during which members

talked about their behaviors and made plans for relationship-building

social outings. Within a year, the regional CEO saw a meaningful

improvement in collaboration. Mutual support and empathy were

clearly evident during meetings. Leaning on the team charter, the team

had begun to behave as a collective.
