individual to which the reputation is referent. They cited the inﬂuential role of reputation and its signaling capacity in an organizational setting by introducing tournament theory.

Proposed by Rosenbaum (1989), tournament theory suggests that those who are successful early in their careers are likely to experience greater success over the course of their careers. The theory suggests that this success is due to the perceptions that others form of them; and in the case of reputation, fast-track employees are promoted based on the reputation gained by early success. This idea is further supported by the theory that ﬁrst impressions play an important part in building reputations because little is known about individuals when they ﬁrst enter an organization, and a reputation is established in order to provide information in predicting future events (Baiman, 1991). In the case of tournament theory, reputation may be considered a signal to decision makers, whereby fast-track employees are identiﬁed and subsequently promoted based on their reputations of early success.
