# on the likelihood of failure decreases.

So, what’s driving the dynamic between scaling speed, experimentation,

and failure? We propose that it boils down to one pivotal force that every

startup must navigate: commitment risk. Scaling requires committing

to an idea, strategy, or product, even if it’s not fully reﬁned. The

risk underlying this commitment is heightened when startups scale

prematurely, as they lock themselves into a particular direction before

fully developing their concept.

In contrast, when startups take the time to scale, they avoid the

risk of committing too early. This approach gives them the leeway

to experiment, reﬁne their idea, and make improvements over time.

Although they may encounter challenges like competition or imitation,

they gain the ﬂexibility to adjust their ideas and strategies. Based on our

ﬁndings, it’s evident that the risk of committing too soon outweighs the
