## Chapter 8 • Performance Management and Employee Development

Feedback reports can include graphs showing the areas in which employees’ perceptions differ the most from the perceptions of other raters. They can also show average scores across sources of information so that the areas that need improvement are readily identified. The resulting report can be e-mailed automatically to the employee and his supervisor so that both have an opportunity to review the results before meeting to create a developmental plan.

Atrend adopted by software companies that offer Internet-based 360-degree systems is to offer a bundle of systems including 360-degree feedback together with learning man- agement, compensation, and even recruiting and succession planning. These integrative applications, usually called “talent management” systems, allow organizations to manage data about employees in a systematic and coordinated way.17 Such integrative software applications allow organizations to create an inventory of their human capital and better understand their strengths and weaknesses at the organizational level. For example, an organization that uses such applications is quickly able to deploy project teams with the appropriate mix of skills and experience after doing a quick search in the database. Another important advantage of these integrative applications is that performance man- agement can be more easily linked to recruiting, compensation, training, and succession planning. In other words, the system can keep track of an employee’s developmental needs and how these needs have been addressed (e.g., via training) over time.

Table 8.3includes a nonexhaustive list of vendors that offer Internet-based 360-degree feedback systems and a brief description of their products. This table also includes informa- tion on whether a demonstration of it is available online. As can be seen by the information included in this table, many such systems are available.
