# Prescriptive analytics

Prescriptive analysis uses <mathematical programming, heuristic search and simulation

modeling to identify the optimal actions= (Duan & Xiong, 2014). It is a process of <prescribing

action and making targeted recommendations based on predictive-analytics finding=

(Caughlin, 2022) The result of prescriptive analysis are options and outcomes for each option.

It offers decision-makers better understandings of the situation when choosing different

alternatives and therefore can generate the best possible outcome.

In business, prescriptive solutions aid business analysts in decision-making by identifying

actions and evaluating their consequences concerning business goals, needs, and limitations.It

is possible to think about prescriptive analytics as a <if..else= statement and take into

consideration its objective and other constraints using algorithms.

According to Fitz-en and Matox (2014), it is rare to be able to see the impact of alternative

investment on the bottom line. Sivarajah et al. (2017) also conclude that the number of effective

prescriptive analytics instances in practical settings is quite scarce.
