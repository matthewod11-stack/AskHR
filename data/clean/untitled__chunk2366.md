# Literary Developments

More literature speciﬁc to school psychology was produced in this period than in all the previous periods combined. In addition to the Thayer Conference proceedings, a special issue of the Journal of Consulting Psychology (Symonds, 1942) focused on practice in the schools. The primary events, however, were the founding of the Journal of School Psy- chology in 1963 and Psychology in the Schools in 1964. School psychology ﬁnally had a literature of its own. The Division of School Psychology had a newsletter, as did the state associations, but their content and circulation were much narrower than these journals provided. Several books about school psychology were published in the 1960s. Many of these were philosophical in nature, describing the authors’ viewpoints on the appropriate roles and functions of school psychologists and their training needs. The literature re- ﬂected the growing interest in the ﬁeld, the need for texts in emerging training programs, and a continuing effort to clarify the ﬁeld’s identity (Fagan, 1986).
