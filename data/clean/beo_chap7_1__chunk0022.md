constructed-preference effects. Anchors might wear off: after experiencing an actual

poetry reading, for example, subjects may quickly develop a consistent hedonic

preference which is no longer affected by the initial anchor or subsequent ones,

and resembles the complete preference assumed in economic theory. Furthermore,

in competitive labor markets, anchors will not affect wages, because wages are

determined by the marginal revenue product of workers. But anchoring could affect

the quantity of labor supplied, even if it does not affect the “price” (i.e., the wage) for

a given amount of labor supply. In the poetry example, think of the anchor fee/wage

as creating a perception about the cost of effort of listening to poetry. Fixing the

wage of poetry (through firm competition), more people will listen to poetry if they

came to perceive the cost as low. So anchors can affect quantities even if they do
