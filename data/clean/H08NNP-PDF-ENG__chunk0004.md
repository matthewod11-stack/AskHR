## HBR / Digital Article / When AI Gets a Board Seat

Impressive though such results are, the studies we are aware of have

all been conducted under artiﬁcial laboratory conditions. Extrapolating

these to real-world conditions is far from straightforward. Executives in

the wild face unframed and shifting challenges, often with insuﬃcient

or inaccurate data.

We wanted to understand: What happens if we take AI out of the lab

into a real company? Over the past year we joined a series of executive

team meetings at Giesswein, an $85 million revenue company based in

Austria, that sells organic, eco-friendly wool sneakers. Our idea was to experiment with diﬀerent ways of integrating AI into their executive

meetings to understand what works and how.
