From there, you’ll need to adjust your training and development

programs to ensure that high-potential employees learn at an

accelerated pace. Think of them as having two jobs: their day job and

turnover. Great Place To Work, a workplace culture research group,

reports that micromanaged employees are three times more likely to

experience burnout. To avoid this fate, learn to delegate and delete.

are revenue-producing versus those that aren’t. Anything that doesn’t

generate money for your ﬁrm isn’t something you should do.
