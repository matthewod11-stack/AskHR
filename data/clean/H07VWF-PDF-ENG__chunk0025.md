# Expect a Learning Curve

With any training program, the ﬁrst few days are fun — there’s

excitement that comes with new hobbies or projects. But then the real

work sets in, and to get better, you have to stick with it. Improvement

requires dedication, tenacity, commitment, and time. You have to

plug through the hard days and can’t give up when things get rough.

Otherwise, you’ll never meet your goal.

Brain training with an infant is no diﬀerent. Everyone who has spent

time with a baby knows how hard it can be: the sleep deprivation, the

crying, the uncertainty, the monotony. But like other training programs,

you need to persevere, and give your brain the stimulation it needs to

grow and adapt, preparing you for a lifetime of parenthood.
