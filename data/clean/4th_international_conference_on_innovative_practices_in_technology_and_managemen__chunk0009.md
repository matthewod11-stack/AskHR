# INTRODUCTION

Employee attrition poses a substantial challenge for corporations, resulting in considerable monetary losses and probable recognized as irreplaceable resources [1]. This study emphasizes the importance of predicting employee attrition through various Machine Learning (ML) strategies through HR Analytics, predominantly through the application of ML and specifically by Predictive Analytics (PA), offering a promising avenue for forecasting attrition trends. ML is a subset of AI that’s instrumental in developing intelligent systems. PA has defined by [2], comprises extracting insights from prevailing datasets to predicts consequences. Recent advancements in computer science have witnessed the widespread adoption of learning algorithms, offering robust quantitative methodologies to extract insights from industry data. Particularly, supervised machine learning methods, where computers learn from extensive analyses of large-scale labeled datasets, have proven effective across diverse domains, such as biology, medical sciences, transportation, political science, and beyond. In the context of HRM, researchers have explored numerous ML approaches, leveraging the strides in information technology, to enhance HR outcomes. The prediction of employee attrition
