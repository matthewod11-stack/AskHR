# consequences of the choice.

. . .

Our research suggests that one-size-ﬁts all guidance exhorting leaders

to delegate may miss important nuance. Delegating decisions can carry

signiﬁcant negative interpersonal costs that managers would be wise to

weigh alongside the potential beneﬁts of freeing up time and energy.

Our work provides insight into the decision contexts in which these

costs are more and less likely to accrue: When the decision outcome

has a high potential to have negative consequences, is outside of

the employee’s scope of responsibilities, and primarily aﬀects others,

there are likely to be interpersonal costs of decision delegation, and

managers looking to utilize their employees’ knowledge should ask for

advice instead. When these elements are reversed, transferring decision

responsibility is likely to be less interpersonally costly and might

provide employees a better venue to test out their decision-making
