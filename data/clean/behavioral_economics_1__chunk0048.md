Public finance: Behavioral public finance asks how limits on consumer and voter rationality influence

taxation and public spending. Two pioneering examples are Krishna and Slemrod (2003) and McCaffrey’s

(1994) paper on cognitive psychology and taxation. The central principle is that some taxes are more visible

than others. Politicians exploit these differences in searching for ways to increase tax receipts. A full theory of

taxation and spending therefore depends on a good account of which types of taxes are easy and hard to impose

(well-organized interest group competition will matter too, of course), and how astute revenue-seeking

politicians are at understanding investor tax psychology.

Behavioral public economics is also likely to be the franchise that most squarely confronts issues of

welfare analysis in behavioral economics. In the standard theory, what consumers choose is taken as a

tautological definition of welfare (i.e., if consumers are rational, then what they choose is also what is best for

them). Thinking about psychology permits the possibility that private choices do not maximize welfare. For

example, Berridge and Robinson (2003) suggest that separate brain areas control “wanting”—choice—and

“liking”—hedonic evaluation. If liking is true welfare, then neural separability of these processes implies that it

is possible for choice and welfare to be different. The obvious places to look are decisions by adolescents and

addicts (Bernheim and Rangel,2004), and potential mistakes in rare decisions, or when it is difficult to learn
