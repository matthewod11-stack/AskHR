## corporate life with a small, distributed workforce.

When we brought on a few more Netherlands-based team members,

my house was initially our oﬃce. They came over each morning, we

coded side by side, and then they went home. But within a few days we realized that we didn’t need to be colocated to work eﬀectively, so the

team dispersed.

By 2015 we had participated in a Y Combinator boot camp and were

ready to expand our business into the United States. Our investors were

supportive but suggested that we establish a U.S. headquarters, arguing

that although our engineers might be able to work from anywhere, our

sales and ﬁnance teams would have trouble doing so. I moved to the

San Francisco Bay area, and we opened an oﬃce there. Again our new

team members came in for a few days but then retreated to their homes

or other workspaces. Again we saw that colocation wasn’t necessary for

us to create and market a great product. Dmitriy and I made it oﬃcial:

GitLab would be an all-remote company.

Today our more than 2,000 team members are spread across some 60

countries and regions around the world. We neither own nor rent any

corporate oﬃce space, and we believe that our early adoption of an

all-remote approach has made us a better, more scalable company.

Well before the Covid-19 pandemic hastened such a shift for other

organizations, we embraced and developed best practices around

virtual collaboration. We’ve learned that success depends on measuring

output, not input; aligning our people on norms and values; ensuring

that policies and processes are continually and openly documented; and

reinforcing self-management and people-management skills. As a result

we’ve been able to hire top talent from around the world and harness
