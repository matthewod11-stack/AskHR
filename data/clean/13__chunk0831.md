## Developing New Research on Humor and Culture in Organizations

frame’’ in which incongruities and their humorous resolution are expected, the stimulus will result in less humor.

Neurological Basis for Humor Because incongruity theory and the extensions proposed by Wyer and Collins (1992) are cognitive theories, they implicitly assume that brain activity parallels the processes described. Both theoretical models of brain activity and direct and indirect empirical studies of brain activity provide support for these cognitive mechanisms. For example, Berns, Cohen, and Mintun (1997) found that some parts of the brain function to predict events based on context information, while others serve to evaluate whether or not those predictions are true. The latter brain systems become activated when an unexpected or surprising stimuli appears (i.e., a punchline). These functions of these brain regions correspond closely with the process assumed by incongruity theory, in that incongruity theory suggests that there is an initial setting of expectations, followed by a violation of those expectations that occurs when a novel expectation system is linked with the ﬁrst.

In another study of event-related potential (ERP) brainwaves, Derks, Gillikan, Bartolome-Rull, and Bogart (1997) found that a distinct P300 wave followed by a N400 wave were detected following joke punch lines when participants reported experiencing amusement in response to jokes. This corresponds with phases of humor cognition implied by incongruity theory, because the P300 wave is associated with information categoriza- tion, whereas the N400 wave is associated with recognition of an error or anomalous event, and indicates that initial categorization was unsuccessful. The authors also noted that when participants laughed in response to the humorous stimuli, this was associated with more total involvement of the cerebral cortex (which is involved with complex information processing). This ﬁnding is consistent with Wyer and Collins’ (1992) principle that elaboration should be associated with amusement.

Finally, a study by Vaid, Hull, Heredia, Gerkens, and Martinez (2003) measured the mental accessibility of initial joke frames (expectations) and the unexpected or incongruous joke frame at points during the joke set up, during the establishment of incongruity, and at incongruity resolution. Results suggested that both initial and incongruity expectation systems were highly accessible during the introduction of the incongruity, whereas the initial joke frame became low in accessibility during joke resolution. This result is consistent with an incongruity theory view (e.g., Suls, 1972), as well as Katz’ (1993) incongruity-based neural model of humor cognition, and Wyer and Collins’ (1992) principle of diminishment.
