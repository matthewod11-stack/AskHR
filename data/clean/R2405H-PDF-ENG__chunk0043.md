## organization beneﬁt ﬁnancially as a result of reductions in bedsores

and fall rates?). As one of the nursing-home directors explains, “Aside

from helping our residents, we now have a business case for our safety

strategy. We track falls and bedsores for each shift—improving safety

helps residents and it helps our bottom line.”

Companies often fall into the trap of tracking too many generic safety

metrics that are not clearly linked to speciﬁc outcomes. When that

happens, employees quickly become cynical about such measures,

viewing them as bureaucratic box-checking that eats up their time

rather than genuine eﬀorts to improve safety. The nursing-home

chain initially had this problem—it was tracking more than 15 safety

metrics, many of which had no clear connection to reducing the

number of falls or bedsores. For example, some of the original safety

metrics pertained to front-desk monitoring, parking lot incidents, safety

measures reported by vendors, and even neighborhood-crime tracking.

Once management realized its mistake, it dramatically simpliﬁed the

measurement system. The chain focused on just a few key metrics

that were statistically linked to the outcomes it cared about. By

jettisoning measures that weren’t adding value, leaders could focus

employee attention on the ones that mattered. The Texas school district

went through a similar winnowing process. Initially each school was

required to track more than 60 safety metrics; of them, only ﬁve

were statistically predictive of student bullying and physical safety. By

ruthlessly prioritizing a small number of metrics clearly linked to safety

outcomes, both organizations built employee buy-in, saved employee

time, and drove real improvements.
