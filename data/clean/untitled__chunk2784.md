The introduction of scientiﬁc psychology as we know it is a comparatively recent phenomenon, traditionally dating to 1879 when Wundt established his laboratory in Leipzig and attracted students from all parts of the world. On their return home, Wundt’s disciples established the ﬁrst psychological laboratory in their country, directed the ﬁrst institute of psy- chology, and founded one or more journals of psychology (Ardila, 1982a).

It was not until 1889 that the ﬁrst International Congress of Physiological Psychology was convened in Paris. The closing banquet was held in the just-completed Eiffel Tower. Most congress participants were ofﬁcially identiﬁed with philosophy, medicine, or one of the traditional sciences. Few scientists at that time claimed the title of “psychologist” (MacLeod, 1957). Historically,

internationalism in psychology probably began with the arrival of the ﬁrst non-Greek visitors to the Academy of Athens, established by Plato in 387 B.C.E. While he would not have called it psychology, Plato’s speculations often focused on human behavior. When Aristotle wrote De Anima in 330 B.C.E., Greek philosophy was replete with valu- ablepsychologicalintuitionsonthenatureofcommunication, leadership, and social conditions affecting self-esteem. Many psychologicalterms,concepts,andtheorieshavetheirrootsin the thoughts of Hellenic philosophers (Georgas, 1994).

The pedigree of psychology probably reaches further back in time to the civilizations of ancient China, India, and the Arab world. The writings of Confucius (500 B.C.E.) contain a wealth of psychological thought. The goodness and evil of human nature and the essence of the human spirit were dis- cussed in relation to ethical, political, and educational theo- ries (Ching, 1980).

In India, the roots of psychology can be traced to the vast storehouse of ancient philosophical and religious texts as well as folklore (Sinha, 1986). During a period of several centuries B.C.E., the search for an understanding of human be- havior led to the development of a psychological system of nature quite different from that of the Greco-Roman renais- sance (Murphy & Kovach, 1972).

In the Arab world, philosophers inherited Greek philo- sophical speculations and mixed them with their religious and moral traditions. Islamic thinkers made major contribu- tions in the Middle Ages, including recognition of the innate psychological foundations of social life, factors affecting group cohesion, the psychology of different cultures, and the relationship between personality characteristics and voca- tional success (Ahmed, 1992, 1997; Soueif, 1963).

The medieval period was followed by a revival of learning (Watson, 1960). In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a re- birth of Greek, particularly Aristotelian, ways of thinking, led to empirical, especially experimental, ways of approaching nature. “Out of the work of Renaissance man comes what we know about the origins of our present knowledge” (Watson, 1960, p. 254).
