# International Psychology

There are diverse approaches to reviewing the history of international psychology, ranging from theoretical concepts proposed by “Great Men” and “Great Women” to an analysis of the “Zeitgeist” in different countries or regions (e.g., Gilgen & Gilgen, 1987; Hilgard, Leary, & McGuire, 1991; Pawlik & Rosenzweig, 1994; Pawlik & d’Ydewalle, 1996; Rosenzweig, 1992; Sexton & Hogan, 1992). The only histor- ical overviews located in the literature are those prepared on behalf of international organizations (e.g., Cautley, 1992; Jing, 2000; Merenda, 1995; Rosenzweig, Holtzman, Sabourin, & Bolanger, 2000; Wilpert, 2000).

In writing this chapter, we recall Watson’s (1960) com- ment that “it would be a serious mistake to consider the his- tory of psychology to be limited to a mere chronology of events or biographical chitchat” (p. 254). This is particularly true for international psychology. In our view, psychological contributions are embedded in the social context from which they emerge, seen within the perspective of personal and national values. Within that context, ours is but a ﬁrst at- tempt to record some aspects of the history of “international psychology.”
