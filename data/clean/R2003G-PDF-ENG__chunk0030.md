# they will?

Even in these circumstances, some chief executives are reluctant to add

the CoS role. That may stem from unfamiliarity: Without ever having seen a skilled CoS in action, it can be diﬃcult to envision the value one

can add. Sometimes reluctance is more about optics and concern that a

CoS will make the leader seem imperious or desirous of an “entourage.”

Those considerations are understandable. But when set up in the right

way, a CoS position can make it much easier to solve the problems

facing a leader with a change agenda.
