# Regulations governing child labor in non-farm jobs di(cid:211)er somewhat from those pertaining to agricultural employment. In non-farm

work, the permissible jobs and hours of work, by age, are as follows:

- 1. Youths 18 years or older may perform any job, whether hazardous or not, for unlimited hours;

- 2. Minors 16 and 17 years old may perform any nonhazardous job, for unlimited hours; and

- 3. Minors 14 and 15 years old may work outside school hours in various nonmanufacturing, nonmining, nonhazardous jobs

under the following conditions: no more than 3 hours on a school day, 18 hours in a school week, 8 hours on a non-school

day, or 40 hours in a non-school week. Also, work may not begin before 7 a.m., nor end a(cid:212)er 7 p.m., except from June 1

through Labor Day, when evening hours are extended to 9 p.m. Under a special provision, youths 14 and 15 years old

enrolled in an approved Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) may be employed for up to 23 hours in

school weeks and 3 hours on school days (including during school hours). In addition, academically oriented youths enrolled

in an approved Work-Study Program (WSP) may be employed during school hours.

Fourteen is the minimum age for most non-farm work. However, at any age, minors may deliver newspapers; perform in radio, television, movie, or theatrical productions; work for parents in their solely-owned non-farm business (except in mining,

manufacturing or on hazardous jobs); or gather evergreens and make evergreen wreaths.
