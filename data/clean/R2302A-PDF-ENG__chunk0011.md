It won’t surprise you to learn that we use the GitLab platform to

are to be completed. Those issues are assigned to one or more team

members via a “merge request” labeled “work in progress.” Colleagues trade oﬀ working on the issue until they deem it ready to “stage” and

“commit.” Their code is then run through a series of diagnostics that

test for accuracy, security, and performance. If it passes muster, it’s

launched, and we continue to track how it performs. If problems are

identiﬁed, the team iterates on solutions. This entire history of work
