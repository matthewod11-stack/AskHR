## Organized Industrial-Organizational Psychology

As applied psychology expanded and the demand for applied psychologists increased, interest in professional organiza- tions ﬂourished. Early organizations for I-O psychologists and their dates of formation can be found in Katzell and Austin (1992). Benjamin (1997) traced the development of professional groups for I-O psychologists, with speciﬁc atten- tion to the evolution of SIOP.AAAPSection D: Industrial and Business was the professional organization for psychologists in industry during the early years. In 1945, theAAAPmerged with APA, and Division 14, Industrial and Business, was formed with 130 members (fellows and associates). In 1985, shortly after SIOP incorporated in 1982 to achieve some in- dependence fromAPA(Hakel, 1979), there were 2,499 mem- bers (fellows, members, and associates). When this chapter was written, there were 3,655 professional members (fellows, members, and associates) (Lee Hakel, personal communica- tion,August 4, 2000).The overall purpose of the current soci- ety is not signiﬁcantly different from the purpose established by the AAAP Section D in 1937; clear linkages between SIOP’s and AAAP’s objectives are obvious. The society changed with regard to structure, membership, and activities, primarily because of the expansion of the discipline and the growth of membership (Benjamin, 1997). For example, the organization evolved from one that was totally managed by volunteers to one now staffed professionally (Koppes, 2000).
