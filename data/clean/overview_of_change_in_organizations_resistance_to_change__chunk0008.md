The process of change in organizations comprises six steps, in a cyclical model (Georgalis et al,

2015):

- perceiving an opportunity or a problem;  diagnosing the situation and generating ideas for change;   planning to overcome resistance to change;   monitoring and assessing the results. implementing the change;

adopting a change proposal;

The forces that generate change, both from outside and from inside the organization, are those which impose the need for change in organizations. The forces operating from outside the organization are represented by four types of external forces, as follows (Kinicki & Williams, 2020, p. 381-382):

- “Demographic features”: age, education, level of skill, gender, immigration.  “Technological progress”: technology does not refer only to computer technology; it is any machine or process allowing an organization to obtain a competitive advantage in changing the materials used to produce a finite product.

- “Social and political pressures”: social events may generate considerable pressure.  “Shareholders, customers and market changes”: changes in customer preferences, national and international competition, mergers and acquisitions.

The forces originating from the organization are internal forces affecting the organization, such

as low job satisfaction. Internal forces may be of two types:

- Human resource concerns: unsatisfied needs, job dissatisfaction, absenteeism, low the employees, turnover and productivity, weak participation/involvement of complacency, bureaucracy.

- Management behaviour: conflicts, reorganization, change of goals.
