delivered to their seats. The same comfort that an airline passenger gets, choosing from the menu and getting a hot meal at their seats. The firm is also in talks with the railways to set up its next Foodbox at Chennai Central. “We are also looking to take the machine to trade shows and exhibitions,” says Chamyvelumani.

The company is eying about 500+ stores in the next 5 years. Foodbox is the best alternate for a place where a food court is not practical.

The model allowssetting up a national or even global chain by collaborating with local vendors (in each region).

Its menu is restricted and dominated by different variety of pizzas. The second largest player Subway also has casual dining model but the ordering process is very lengthy; sandwiches made to order with 30 different options for a single sub! Faaso’s which is the biggest Indian fast food player has 64 outlets across India but it only dishes out wraps and not the complete Indian meal.

Therefore, the concept of aggregation for fresh food and delivery through fully automated outlets is something that has never been done before. The customer gets his favorite restaurants’ food all un der one roof, for about the same price. The restaurants can reach more customers (outlets) without incurring any additional fixed cost. So this is a true gain for all (including the business).
