# A Roadmap for Leaders

To create a supportive structure for expatriates, leaders should:

- 1. Assess current structures: Use surveys and feedback from current

employees and former expatriate managers to identify misalignments

in decision-making, guidelines, and collaboration tools. What were

the pain points? What autonomy did managers crave? What formal

structures would have been helpful to keep things on track or from

going too far aﬁeld?

- 2. Optimize decentralization: Delegate authority where

responsiveness is crucial, while setting clear boundaries.

- 3. Reﬁne formalization: Develop adaptable policies that balance

consistency and ﬂexibility. Regularly update these policies based

on feedback from on-the-ground employees and changing site-

speciﬁc regulations. Check-in regularly to help provide structure that

managers may need as they experiment.
