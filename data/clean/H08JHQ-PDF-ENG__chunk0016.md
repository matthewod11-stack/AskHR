## Mistake 3: Not Asking the Right Questions

Your performance conversation should be a two-way street, particularly

when it comes to critical feedback. To provide your employee with

useful guidance, you need to uncover what’s driving their poor

performance. Asking the right questions will help you do that.

Instead of starting the conversation by making conclusive statements

like, “You’re not fully focused on your work these days,” ask open-

ended questions such as, “How are you feeling about the job?” or

“How are things going in your role?” Questions like these can help you

understand the other person’s perspective, including any concerns or

challenges they may be struggling with. Knowing where they’re coming

from will allow you to give advice that addresses the actual problem —

rather than what you think the problem is.

When your employee speaks, suspend judgement and listen actively.

There are many possible reasons for poor performance, and each demands a diﬀerent course of action. In my experience, some common

causes include:

- Personal issues such as poor health or family problems

- A lack of skills or experience needed to do the job

- A lack of clear direction around your expectations

- A poor attitude or lack of motivation
