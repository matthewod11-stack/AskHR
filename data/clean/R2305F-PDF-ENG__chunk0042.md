I started to become interested in age diversity at work 25 years ago in my

ﬁrst management role. I had hired a woman who was exactly the same

age as my mother to join my team. A pharmacist by training, Carole

was elegant and worldly and was taking on her ﬁrst job after spending

18 years raising children. I still remember how awkward I felt when she began having diﬃculty with a client and I had to give her corrective

guidance. The age diﬀerence hadn’t seemed a problem when things

were going well, but I couldn’t ﬁgure out how to avoid coming oﬀ as

obnoxious when I outlined which behaviors she needed to change.

The experience I was having is sometimes referred to as status

incongruence. This basically means that the status accorded your role in

society doesn’t match the part you’re playing in the current context. One

research project with 8,000 employees in Germany showed that when

younger managers supervise older workers, status incongruence has a

measurable negative impact on employees’ happiness. It’s not just that
