# Regularities at the Five-Factor Level

As we have noted, lexical studies in languages originating in north- ern Europe (including English) have been supportive of the Big Five, and so has a study in Turkish. But studies in Italian (De Raad, Di Blas, & Perugini, 1997) and Hungarian (Szirmák & De Raad, 1994) found no counterpart to the Intellect factor in ﬁve-factor solutions. In- stead, there were two Agreeableness-related factors, one contrast- ing peacefulness with aggression and irritability and the other contrasting humaneness with greed and egotism (compare Deary, 1996). Extraction of additional factors was necessary to ﬁnd a fac- tor related to Intellect.

Several lexical studies have included a relatively broad selection of variables, each with terms that could be classiﬁed as referring to emotions and moods or as being unusually highly evaluative, and two of these studies included terms referring to physical appear- ance. Because none of these studies found the Big Five in a ﬁve- factor solution, it is clear that the appearance of the Big Five as the ﬁrst ﬁve factors is contingent on some strictures in variable selection.
