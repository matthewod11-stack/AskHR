## The Ethics of Using Role Play in Employee Trainings

As you learned in this chapter, role plays are good

teaching tools when training employees on what is called the “soft skills” of the workplace.

“Soft skills” refer to the interpersonal skills, and include skills pertaining to such areas as conflict man- agement, stress management, customer service skills, communication skills, and mediation skills.

The philosophy behind role plays is that they

should serve as a “rehearsal” of actual situations that could occur in the workplace. Trainees are given situations and asked to act them out in front of the other trainees. Sometimes, selected participants act out an example of the “wrong” way to do something, followed by a re-enactment of the “right” way to do it. After the situation is done the “wrong” way, par- ticipants are usually asked what was wrong and how would they handle the situation differently. Then, the same situation would be acted out, only in the right way.

Sometimes, role plays consist of trainees acting out a situation based on what they think is the right

way. For example, when employees are being trained on how to manage conflict, the trainer will spend some time lecturing on the steps to take to manage conflict. Then, trainees are given a scenario to role- play and asked to apply what they have learned to that scenario. After it has been acted out, trainees are then asked to critique how well the role player did and how that role player could improve. The idea behind doing role plays this way is that it gives people an opportu- nity to practice what they learn in a safe environment, before they have to actually use the skills in a real life situation. Role plays provide practice and immedi- ate feedback from others that will improve the role player’s performance in actual situations.

The ethical concerns of using role plays are

these: In many training programs, participating in role plays is mandatory. That is, the trainee cannot say “I don’t want to do it.” When the training is com- prised of just a few participants, usually every par- ticipant is asked to act out a scenario in front of the others. Many people do not like to participate in role

plays because it makes them nervous and, at times, terrifies them. So critics would ask: Is it ethical to put people through something with such a negative impact?

Another ethical concern is that role plays can

often be somewhat challenging. For example, a pro- fessor at one university, when doing training in his management class, pretends that he is an employee who has a body odor problem. This is a situation that occurs in many organizations! Students are then asked to role play how, if they were this person’s supervisor, they would tell this person of his body odor and the impact it is having at work on other employees. The professor, in an attempt to make it even more real-life, often will yell and even physically push the student in “anger.” His thought is that there are many times when employees do get very upset when given this type of evaluation. Many students come out of that role play upset and even scared! Trainers who use this type of forceful role play say that in order for people to get comfortable with using their soft skills, they must be faced with scenarios that have actually occurred

in organizations and that may occur in one of the organizations in which they may work.

Proponents of role plays ask how ethical it is NOT

to make trainees practice these skills before using them. Merely sitting in a room listening to a trainer and doing exercises is not enough to properly prepare employees for what they might face in real-life situ- ations. For example, just reading or listening how to manage an upset customer does not guarantee that trainees will be able to apply those skills once they leave the training. But, if you make them practice those skills via role plays, that will better ensure that they will be able to handle the situation.
