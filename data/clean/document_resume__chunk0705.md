# Minimizing Rater Errors

The third technique which is av ailable to help raters keep accurate records of their observations is the use of a checklist. Exhibit 6.5 displays a checklist devised by William Ronan for evaluating college classroom teaching effectiveness.'4

Ronan's checklist was devised for students to use when evaluating the classroom teaching performance of their professors. Similar checklists can be devised for use by a variety of observers from different perspectives. The secret to devising these checklists is to perform a thorough job analysis- -using the critical incident technique or a similar method--to determine the key behaviors which distinguish effective from ineffective performance. Brief descriptions of these key behav iors are then arranged in checklist format and provided to observers who are in a position to see the occurrence of these key behaviors.

The checklist thus serves two important purposes.

(I) focuses the observers' attention on important behav iors, and t 2) pros ides a record of those behaviors which were actually observed.
