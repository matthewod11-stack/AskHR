## work settings (Weick and Berlinger, 1989).

We argue that there are at least two key implications at this level of analysis.

Firstly, from a demand perspective, organisation should recognise the importance of the

external labour market in their talent management systems. Owing to the increasing

career mobility evident in the current labour market it may be possible to recruit high

performing candidates from the external labour market. As Arthur (1994: 295) argues

“organizational effectiveness can be enhanced by career movements across

organizational boundaries” This may be particularly relevant in some specific

circumstances. As DeFillippi and Arthur (1994: 315), building on the contribution of

Spender (1989), note “a person hired with experience in one firm may be pre-

socialised…and pre-trained…to perform similar tasks in another firm”. Indeed, over

three decades ago, Pfeffer and Leblebici (1973) argued that organisations facing the

greatest threat from external sources aggressively recruited executives with experience

from the external labour market. Similarly, Roa and Drazin (2002) argue that the

recruitment of managers from the external labour market is an important means through

which newly established and poorly connected firms can reduce the constraints on
