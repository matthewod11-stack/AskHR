## support through additional training and development programs.

How do you keep your workforce up to speed on emerging skills?

We do it by fostering a culture of continuous learning and empowering

employees to take charge of their own development. For rapidly changing

skills, like those involving AI, we provide training on an aggressive

schedule while ensuring employees balance their development with daily

responsibilities. Managers play a crucial role in guiding their teams, helping

them navigate the challenge of staying current while meeting execution

demands. The key is offering the right resources and support to help

employees keep pace with evolving skill requirements.
