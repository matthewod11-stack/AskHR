## misinformation and rumor with clarity and connection.

To let employees into your thinking:

- Build “framing statements” into all-hands meetings and emails—e.g.,

“Here’s what we were weighing,” “Here’s what we still don’t know,” or

“Here’s how we landed where we did.”

- Encourage leaders to narrate their thinking in real time by using

statements like, “I’m processing this as I go, but here’s where my head

is right now,” especially in live discussions or Q&As.

. . .

Conﬁdence in leadership teams doesn’t come from perfection—it comes from coherence, conviction, and visible eﬀort. In a time when so much

feels out of control, leadership teams that commit to showing up with

transparency, humility, and unity give their organizations something

rare: a steady hand. The world may not be getting easier to lead through,

but teams that embrace these practices will make it easier for others to

believe in and ultimately follow their leadership.
