Independent variables were created on the basis of the infor- mationfromeachcompany’sHEROScorecard.Initially,16variables were included in statistical models (see Table 3). For brevity, only the variables that were detected as statistically signiﬁcant contributors of one or more of the three dependent variables will be described. Informationonmeasuresthatwerenotstatisticallysigniﬁcantwillbe provided upon request. Table 4 summarizes how each independent variable was deﬁned and coded from the original survey responses. Four dichotomous dummy variables were created from one HERO Scorecard question about the use of incentives for comple- tionofanHA.Responseoptionsweregroupedasanoncashincentive type if respondents indicated a token noncash reward, intracompany competition, rafﬂes/prizes, or participation on company time. Re- sponses were grouped as cash if respondents indicated a cash or gift card. Responses were grouped as a beneﬁts-integrated incentive if respondents indicated that the company made ﬁnancial contributions to a health savings account, ﬂexible spending account, or health re- imbursement account or if the company offered lower copayments, lower deductibles, or lower employee premium contributions. If an organization used cash or beneﬁts-integrated strategies, they were also grouped into a fourth “cash or better” variable. A similar set of three dichotomous dummy variables was created from another question, which asked about the use of incentives for lifestyle man- agement programs.

Another question on the HERO Scorecard asked whether the organization offered on-site or near-site preventive health screenings or whether they conducted special campaigns to promote screening. Becausenoneofthecompaniesinthestudysampleconductedspecial campaigns to promote screening without also providing on-site or near-site screening, this variable was coded as one dichotomous dummy variable.
