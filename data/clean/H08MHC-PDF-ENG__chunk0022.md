# eﬃciency approach.

The designed simplicity approach improves transformation success

while reducing the risk of unintended consequences, and actually

increases the likelihood of additional beneﬁts beyond the

transformation’s objective:

- Staﬀ satisfaction increases by 123%

- Eﬃciency goes up by 68%

- The struggle to meet ordinary demands is reduced by 26%

- And the typical decline in employee morale born out of transformation

is reduced by 51%
