## Why Designed Simplicity Succeeds Where Efficiency Fails

Why does designed simplicity work so well?

Designed simplicity focuses on the transformation’s ROI, not its ﬁnish line.

The eﬃciency approach aims to reduce the time between the decision to

transform and the implementation of the transformation, and by doing

so minimize time-to-ROI. Not only does this not work, as mentioned

above, but in elevating time-to-ROI, these leaders are mistaking a
