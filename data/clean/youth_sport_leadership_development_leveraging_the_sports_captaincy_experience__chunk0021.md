# The Self-Study Team Captain’s Guide

While we have found the clinics to be a good way to teach young people about leadership, we did not believe that the clinics alone would be enough. For this reason we have written a six-chapter guidebook titled, Becoming an Effective Team Captain: Student-Athlete Guide. Each chapter of this self-study guide discusses a speciﬁc leadership area (e.g., motivation, communication, team building). Content includes basic information on the topic, examples of athletes, coaches and statespersons who are effective in implementing the leadership skill, and practical guidelines for using the information as a captain (see Table 3). All chapters contain a number of exercises for the athletes to complete in the clinic and on their own. For example, they may create a proﬁle of their captain capabilities, identify the characteristics of the most and least effective communicators they have observed in sport and otherwise, work through speciﬁc case examples, or list their motivational strengths and areas for improvement. While the guide is designed to parallel and complement the information contained in the clinic, it can also be used
