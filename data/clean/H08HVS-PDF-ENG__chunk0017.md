## organ donation questions on the driver’s license application. The opt-

in/opt-out questions were so badly worded that it sounded as if “the

DMV would try to remove an organ right there on the spot.” Those

two employees then sketched out proposed changes in wording and

formatting on sticky notes. Gordon took the notes back to the engineers

at the DMV’s Sacramento headquarters, who implemented the changes.

It cranked up the emotions that propel change.

As Chip and Dan Heath document in Made to Stick, making rational

and evidence-based arguments — especially through dull emails and

memos packed with new expectations, procedures, and rules — is

a lousy way to motivate people to change their behavior. Change is

more likely to start, spread, and stick when messages are wrapped in

compelling language and stories that trigger action-inspiring emotions

including enthusiasm, empathy, anger, and pride.
