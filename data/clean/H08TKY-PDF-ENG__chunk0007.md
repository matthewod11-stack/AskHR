Adjacency expansion: Sustained, proﬁtable growth when a company

expands the boundaries of its core business into an adjacent space.

Companies that are repeatedly successful at adjacency expansion

share two common characteristics. First, they are extraordinarily

disciplined, applying rigorous screens before they make an adjacency

move. This discipline pays oﬀ in the form of learning curve beneﬁts,

increased speed, and lower complexity. Second, in almost all cases,

these companies develop their repeatable formulas by studying their

customers and their customers’ economics very carefully.
