Team task performance TTP is an interesting mediator as it plays an important clarifying role between TIQ and proﬁtability performance. When we measured the direct relationship between TIQ and proﬁt- ability performance, we found that it was weak and not signiﬁcant (β=0.06). This is because TIQ has both positive and negative impacts on proﬁtability performance that are ‘cancelling’ each other out (hence the low β). However, when we add TTP as the mediator, we ﬁnd that TTP is channeling the negative impact TIQ has on proﬁtability performance (indirect β=−0.33, P<0.01), which then allows the positive effect to be manifested in the direct path (β=0.42, P<0.01). Thus, the mediating role of TTP, although not as expected, provides greater clariﬁcation on the eustress and distress effects TIQ has on proﬁtability performance.
