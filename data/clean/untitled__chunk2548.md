# Education and Training 459

In addition to the didactic educational requirements, the professional practice specialty of clinical health psychology requires sound training experiences in health assessment, interventions, and consultations. Fundamental to education and training in clinical health psychology is the scientist- practitioner model, a biopsychosocial approach, faculty role models for research and practice, access to health care set- tings, participation and active supervision by a multidiscipli- nary faculty in a health care setting, and exposure to diverse clinical problems and populations.

The conference in 1983 also established the Council of Health Psychology Training Directors. This group provides a forum to discuss education and training issues across bac- calaureate, graduate, and postgraduate levels and to develop policy related to health psychology education and training. The council has been involved in developing guidelines for the accreditation of education and training programs that would inform the APA Committee on Accreditation in their review process. The ﬁrst postdoctoral program in health psychology was accredited by the APA in 2001.

One measure of the growth of the new ﬁeld was that by 1990, Sayette and Mayne found that health psychology was the most frequently noted area of faculty research in APA- accredited clinical psychology doctoral programs.

The needs of already trained practitioners who wish to develop more expertise so as to ethically expand their areas of practice have also been recognized, especially as the knowl- edge base for practice has expanded and the ﬁeld has become more mainstream. In 1997, Belar and colleagues developed a model for self-assessment to facilitate practitioners’ identiﬁ- cation of gaps in knowledge and skills. Self-assessment could then permit the design of appropriate continuing-education activities for the ethical expansion of practice (Belar et al., 2001).

Nearly 20 years after the Arden House Conference, the APADivisionofHealthPsychologyagreedtosponsoranother national conference under the leadership of then president Kenneth A. Wallston (also a longtime editor of the division’s newsletter, The Health Psychologist).The conference, held in 2000, was designed to focus future issues for the discipline and the profession. Participants examined speciﬁc areas with respect to implications of new research for education and training, clinical practice, research, and public policy, includ- ing: evolution of the biopsychosocial model; advances in medicine; changes in population demographics, health care economics,andthehealthpsychologymarketplace;needsand advances in primary prevention; and developments in inter- ventions. Participants reported that there was an increased need for attention in the doctoral curriculum to genetics,
