Newton Cheng is an example of one of these decision-makers. He

is a former engineer who serves as Google’s director of health and

performance, and he is one of the most powerful advocates I’ve seen

for improving mental well-being in large, complicated organizations.

Cheng is both public about his own mental health issues — which

helps him connect to the wider employee base — while also working

to change a large system, navigate red tape, and meet business goals.

In a conversation I had with him, Cheng reﬂected on why his mental

health workshops around Google are successful: “I’m sitting in the

same shared stigma they are. I’m modeling what it looks like to lead

vulnerably in the same organization they are. It gets really hard to do

anything about mental health until you see someone who’s doing it

right in front of you.”

Don’t get me wrong, outside clinicians and practitioners help leaders

develop crucial mental health literacy and learn to talk about and model

healthy practices. But experts don’t get it like managers do. And yet

Newton is the ﬁrst to admit that becoming this leader took time and

a lot of trial and error, plus a comfort with risk. Organizations that

want to create mentally healthy cultures need to recruit well-respected,

successful insiders who are willing to step out and take the lead. Others

will follow!
