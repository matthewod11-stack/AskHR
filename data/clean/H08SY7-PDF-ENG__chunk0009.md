## happens when your brain draws on a vast reservoir of pattern

recognition, emotional memory, and contextual ﬂuency to produce a

sense of direction. That internal process culminates in a gut feel: the

moment of felt clarity when you just know what to do.

These two concepts are often conﬂated. But the distinction is critical:

- Intuition is the process.

- Gut feel is the outcome.

When seasoned CEOs say, “I trust my gut,” what they’re often doing—

consciously or not—is trusting the culmination of thousands of micro-

decisions, failures, patterns, feedback loops, and mental models they’ve

built up over time. Like an algorithm trained on deeply personalized

data, their intuition is continually reﬁning itself—especially when they

reﬂect, recalibrate, and stay aware of its limits.
