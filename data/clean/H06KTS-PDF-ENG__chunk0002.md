One of my clients is an executive who has been with her company for

more than 20 years. Over the past several months many of her peers

have moved on from the company, part of 2021’s turnover tsunami.

She’s now surrounded by new hires and she worries that she is being

associated with the “way things used to be” and unfairly seen as

someone who isn’t innovative, strategic or willing to take risks by virtue

of being a “long-timer” at the company.
