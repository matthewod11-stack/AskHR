# Characteristics of Practice

Speciﬁc practice information is provided in Hildreth (1930) and in her diary entries when she was a school psychologist for the Okmulgee, Oklahoma, schools (1922–1923). (The Educational Testing Service maintains her papers.) These and other retrospective accounts reveal an expansion of services from the previous period, though services were still domi- nated by the psychoeducational assessment role. Newly de- veloped tests of achievement, as well as the Binet scales, revised in 1937 to include two forms (Land M), were in wide- spread and frequent use. Practitioners were also involved in group testing, academic remediation, adjustment services for children with social and emotional problems, and consul- tation, while administrative, in-service education, and re- search duties continued to take up small percentages of time. Watson’s behaviorism had a discernible impact on educators, although it is unlikely that many practitioners were providing behavior modiﬁcation services. In comparison to psychoe- therapeutic interventions, ducational assessment services, behavioral or psychodynamic, were not common among applied psychologists of this period (Loutit, 1939).
