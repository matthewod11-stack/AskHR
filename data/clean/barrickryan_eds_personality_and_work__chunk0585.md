## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 185

member roles. Agreeable team members contributed to team suc- cess by ﬁlling social roles. Conscientious team members ﬁlled crit- ical task roles. Agreeable and conscientious team members were also more accurate in their self-perceptions of social and task roles, respectively. Team members high on Emotional Stability were sim- ilarly found to be more accurate in their self-perceptions of both social and task roles. These results suggest that similar to other set- tings, Conscientiousness is linked to individual performance pri- marily through behavior that represents task contributions. Unique to team settings, Agreeableness is linked to performance primar- ily because of the social demands. The relatively stronger rela- tionship for Emotional Stability may also stem from greater awareness of how an individual member contributes to the team. One effect of organizing workers into teams thus appears to be an increased emphasis on social inputs, and thereby on associated traits such as Agreeableness and sometimes Extraversion. Selecting team members with desirable personality traits may thus be helpful for improving individual performance in team settings. However, as we will see, this improvement in individual performance does not always translate into an improvement in team performance.
