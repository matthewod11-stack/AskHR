## socioeconomic opportunities and outcomes within narrow societal

segments while depriving others.

Unfortunately, artiﬁcial inequality is complex and can be hard to ﬁx.

In my research on the impact of AI across a range of societal issues—

jobs that are vulnerable to disruption, AI’s climate impact, and regions

that might beneﬁt most from AI development—I have found six distinct

“divides” that contribute to artiﬁcial inequality: data, income, usage,

geography, industry, and energy. These divides often reinforce each

other. For example, someone who is more likely to be harmed by biases

in data may also be less likely to beneﬁt from AI productivity tools and

disproportionately aﬀected by higher energy costs.
