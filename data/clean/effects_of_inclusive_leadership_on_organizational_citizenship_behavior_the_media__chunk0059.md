We assume that inclusive leadership may be present unevenly in the Vietnamese firm context. These country- and industry-specific conditions exert a large role in shaping the distinct relationship between inclusive leadership and OCB (Koopman, Den Hartog, & Konrad, 1999). Our explanation is in line with prior research show- ing that OCB is enacted differently in different cultural contexts (Farooqui, 2012). This is also congruent with Podsakoff et al.â€™s (2000) viewpoint that cultural contexts affect the strengths of the relationshipsbetweenOCBanditsantecedents.Werecommendthat future research should conduct an empirical analysis regarding the cross-cultural validity of the influence of inclusive leadership to gain more insights into the relationship between inclusive leadership and OCB outcomes.
