# The Future

We took Kaspi public in 2020 in part to allow our private equity owners

to sell their shares but also because we wanted to showcase the future of

corporate Kazakhstan on a global stage. The country might be known

for its natural resources, but we are capable of developing unique

business models too. We opted for the London Stock Exchange Ô¨Årst

because its investor base tends to better understand Eastern Europe.
