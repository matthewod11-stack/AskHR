# Introduction

High-performing people are critical for high-performing organizations. Whether driven by the need to improve efficiency, pro- ductivity, or profitability, or by the desire to provide world-class customer service, the com- bination of two components is critical: select- ing talented and high-potential people to carry out the organizationâ€™s mission and creating a culture that supports them. Many organiza- tions link between high-performing people, an organizational culture that supports mission accomplish- ment, and high-performing organizations. Two challenges faced by most organizations are the identification of the most effective means to recruit, select, and retain a high-performing workforce, particularly within a tight labor market, and the creation and maintenance of a dynamic culture for employees that fosters achievement.
