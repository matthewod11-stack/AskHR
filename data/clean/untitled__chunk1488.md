# FRAMEWORKS FOR STUDYING WOMEN AND GENDER

Criticisms of psychology’s treatment of women and people of color have been voiced intermittently throughout the his- tory of psychology. As early as 1876, Mary Putnam Jacobi, a physician, challenged the then-popular notion that hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle handicapped women mentally and physically. Jacobi pointed out that re- search on the limitations of women was rarely conducted by women themselves but rather by men, who often attributed sex differences to nature (Sherif, 1979). In effect, Jacobi argued that psychological knowledge is socially situated, that is, that interpretations of data reﬂect the perspectives and interests of the researcher.
