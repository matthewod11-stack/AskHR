# demographics rather than performance.

Keep it simple.

Adopt simpler evaluation processes that direct raters’ attention to

the core assessment—Was the performance good or bad?—rather than

complex rating systems that may introduce ambiguity and bias. Our

research suggests that while more intricate evaluation methods appear

to provide platforms with greater nuance for customers, they often

do not result in material diﬀerences. For example, in our study, we

observed the rating inﬂation that is common on similar platforms:

When using a ﬁve-star scale, customers overwhelmingly assigned

scores of ﬁve stars, eﬀectively diminishing the intended granularity

of the evaluation scale. As raters already underutilize the available

distinctions in more intricate evaluation processes, simplifying the

process may yield similar information while reducing bias.
