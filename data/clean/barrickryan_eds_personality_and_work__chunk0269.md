# 84 PERSONALITY AND WORK

that behavior is determined more by situations than by traits (Guion, 1998).

In the late 1980s, the trait approach to personality was back in vogue, and the trait-versus-situation debate had produced a better understanding of how to predict behavior from traits. In early per- sonality research, correlations were computed between all person- ality variables and all criteria. Most of these correlations were near zero, creating the impression that personality was generally unre- lated to performance. We now better understand that the trait being investigated must be relevant to the criterion and that pre- dictors and criteria should be conceptualized as constructs (Hough & Schneider, 1996). Personality research now involves the speciﬁ- cation of a personality taxonomy, a job performance taxonomy, and hypothesized relationships between them. A meta-analysis by Tett, Jackson, and Rothstein (1991) found generally higher validi- ties in studies that had a clearly stated hypothesis than in purely exploratory studies.

Meta-analyses of the criterion-related validity of personality vari- ables have illustrated the beneﬁt of using personality taxonomies as an organizing framework, revealing personality-performance re- lationships that had not been clear before (for example, Barrick & Mount, 1991; Hough, 1992; Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp, & McCloy, 1990). Barrick, Mount, and Judge (2001) conducted a second-order meta-analysis of all meta-analyses of the relationship between personality and performance conducted during the 1990s. Results were organized according to the Big Five dimensions of per- sonality. Conscientiousness consistently predicted job performance across all criterion types and occupational groups and had the high- est validity of all dimensions. Emotional Stability was the only other dimension to have nonzero true score correlations with overall work performance. Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness to Ex- perience predicted some criterion types in some occupations. These results showed that the Big Five dimensions of personality are valid predictors of performance for at least some jobs and some criteria, although the magnitudes of the validities were relatively low.

Research has moved beyond the search for signiﬁcant correla- tions between Big Five dimensions and general measures of job performance and is focused on understanding in greater depth
