# Literary Development

With few exceptions, literature related to school psychology remained similar to that of the previous period. There were still no journals speciﬁcally about school psychology, and practitioners continued to read education and psychology journals. The addition of the AAAP’s Journal of Consulting Psychology provided a more speciﬁc focus, however. It was also during this period that the ﬁrst text about school psy- chology was published, Psychological Service for School

Problems by Gertrude Hildreth (1930). In addition, the ﬁrst journal article including “school psychologist” in its title ap- peared early during this period (Hutt, 1923).
