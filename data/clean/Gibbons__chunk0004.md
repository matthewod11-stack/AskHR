### **Stage 3: Establishing evaluation frameworks**

Here\'s where most human-AI team implementations fail: they don\'t
establish clear frameworks for evaluating outputs from both humans and
AI. Without systematic evaluation, you can\'t identify when the
collaboration is working versus when it\'s creating risk.

This evaluation must be multidirectional. Humans evaluate AI outputs for
accuracy, relevance, and potential bias. But AI should also analyze
patterns in human decisions to identify potential blind spots or
inconsistencies. And crucially, you need to evaluate the collaboration
itself, not just individual components.

A financial advisory firm implemented this multidirectional evaluation
by having AI analyze patterns in advisor recommendations while advisors
assessed AI-generated insights. They discovered advisors consistently
underweighted certain risk factors while the AI missed crucial
contextual information about client life circumstances. By identifying
these complementary blind spots, they designed workflows that
compensated for both.
