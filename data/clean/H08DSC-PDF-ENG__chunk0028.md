# Actions for the Future

The most obvious action that organizations can take to address these

issues is to create an integrated technology and data leadership role with an eﬀective, business-oriented executive occupying it. Judging

from our interviews, many organizations have already taken that step

and appear to have been successful with it.

If for some reason that isn’t possible, there are other ways that some of

the issues raised in this study can be addressed. One, for example, is

to create greater role clarity for C-level tech and data leaders and make

the role distinctions known to internal customers. Another is to foster

more collaboration among tech and data leaders, which can lead to joint

projects and higher levels of success in delivering them.
