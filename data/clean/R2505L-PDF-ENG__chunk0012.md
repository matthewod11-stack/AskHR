## HBR / Magazine Article / How to Counter Fake News

The disinformation spread rapidly, sparking calls for a boycott and

temporarily driving down PepsiCo’s stock. The company’s response—

a brief clariﬁcation—was too slow and subdued to counteract the viral

outrage, damaging consumer trust.

Fact-based eﬀorts to combat fake news ignore a key insight into

human psychology. People’s opinions are often shaped less by their

own point of view than their perception of what others believe—a

phenomenon that behavioral psychologists call “social proof.” We tend

to be overly and subconsciously inﬂuenced by what we think is the

majority opinion. That’s a problem when it comes to fake news, because people believe that others are more aﬀected by fake news than they

are themselves. A 2023 Ipsos survey of 29 countries highlights this

disparity: While 66% of respondents expressed conﬁdence in their

ability to distinguish real news from fake, only 44% believed the average

person could do so. Because people think and act according to what they perceive to be the majority opinion, they can still be aﬀected by

fake news, even if they know it is false.

Our research, which examines the impact of fake news on corporate

reputations, reveals similar ﬁndings but goes even further in showing the troubling eﬀect of fake news on individuals’ judgments and

behaviors. In a series of experiments, we exposed participants to fake news about diﬀerent companies and then measured their judgments

about the companies’ reputations as well as what they thought others’

judgments were before and after the exposure to the fake news. The fake

news items were modeled after stories that actually circulated online to

enhance realism but were slightly modiﬁed to avoid memory biases.

In our ﬁrst experiment, each participant read a description of an airline

that was positive, negative, or neutral and then read a fake news story in

which the airline was accused of removing passengers from a plane for
