## The Happy/Productive Worker Thesis Revisited

Wright & Cropanzano, 2004). Through the use of EEG measures of brain activity, positive affect has been shown to be associated with left prefrontal activity, while negative affect is associated with right prefrontal activation (Davidson & Tomarken, 1989; Staw, 2004). According to Staw (2004), this frontal cerebral asymmetry reﬂects not only an individual’s current emotional state, but also one’s predisposition to experience positive vs. negative emotional states. More speciﬁcally, according to Tomarken, individuals with enhanced left side Davidson, and Henriques (1990), activation (at rest) typically indicate that they experience more intense emotional individuals with enhanced right side activation (at rest) typically indicate that they experience a heightened level of emotional response to negative stimuli.
