# Physiological Basis for Happiness

As this review clearly demonstrates, there is an ever-increasing body of evidence that happy individuals signiﬁcantly differ from those less happy on a wide range of psychological-based dimensions. In addition, and consistent with a number of pioneering applied scholars, there is a burgeoning body of research over the last 10–15 years indicating that these differences between happy and unhappy people may also have a physiological basis (for a further review of this very interesting line of research, see Staw, 2004; Staw & Cohen-Charash, 2005). For instance, Fredrickson and her colleagues (Fredrickson & Levenson, 1998; Fredrickson et al., 2000; Gross, Fredrickson, & Levenson, 1994) found that the feelings of sadness (unhappiness), fear, and anxiety arouse people’s autonomic nervous systems, producing pronounced increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and vasoconstriction. Alternatively, more positive, happier feelings may be beneﬁcial in helping to quell potentially harmful surges in cardiovascular activity. Furthermore, positive feelings provide additional beneﬁts. For example, they have been shown to produce faster returns to baseline levels of cardiovascular activation following negative emotional arousal (Fredrickson & Levenson, 1998; Fredrickson, Mancuso, Branigan, & Tugade, 2000; Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003), lower levels of cortisol (Steptoe, Wardle, & Marmot, 2005), reductions in subsequent-day physical pain (Gil et al., 2004), and in stroke reduction (Ostir, Markides, Peek, & Goodwin, 2001).

A fascinating growing body of research has helped to further pinpoint the possible physiological basis for happiness (Davidson et al., 2003; Staw, 2004;
