# through performance appraisals

Coaching is concerned with creating conditions so that people can perform to the

best of their ability (Richard, 1995). In coaching the learner receives instant

feedback about their performance, this reinforces success and helps them to quickly

correct any mistakes. Coaching therefore accelerates the performance improvement

processes. Coaching helps leaders to bring out the best in employees throughout the

organization and they begin to embrace and engage in critical thinking. Employees

at all levels accept ownership and accountability for their work product and

relationships. They require less daily and direct supervision from managers as they

develop their skills and strive to reach their full potential.

Coaching to improve or increase performance usually includes an urgent need. For

example, often bad behaviour needs to stop or a new behaviour must be ramped up

in a compressed time frame for a job role (Homan and Miller, 2013). In both

scenarios, it is critical that a manager (or an HR representative) be involved to refine

the goals and focus for performance coaching. In the case of problem behaviour,

there needs to be a documented message to the individual about what is at stake.

The individual receiving coaching must have clarity about what he or she stands to

lose or gain by accepting the influence of a coach and by making specific change.

In other words, the consequences must be spelled out.
