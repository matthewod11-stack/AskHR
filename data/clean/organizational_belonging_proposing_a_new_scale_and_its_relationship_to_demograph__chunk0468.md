2022). A review of the literature revealed that there was not an existing comprehensive scale for measuring OB, but instead a construct measured by combining three variables: identification, identification, without research investigating if each and organizational facet should be equally weighted. Related measures such as workplace belongingness, employee belongingness, organizational connectedness and general belonging were also found lacking. Study results re-affirmed the definition of OB by finding initial empirical support for a new four-scale, 16-item measure, labeled Be Myself (seven items), Acceptance (four items), Diversity Valued (three items) and Connection (two items). Two OB scales had significant impacts on productivity (Be Myself) and intent to stay (Acceptance). As such, this study adds to the OB and workplace health lit- erature, where additional study is needed, including future research further testing the validity of the OB scale using more diverse samples.
