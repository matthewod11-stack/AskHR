# 72 PERSONALITY AND WORK

with others ((cid:1) = .27, n = 1,491), particularly when those jobs involve interacting in teams ((cid:1) = .35, n = 678). Results from Hough’s meta- analysis (1992) support this; she found that Agreeableness corre- lated with measures of teamwork (r = .17). Agreeableness thus appears to be an important predictor of behavior in cooperative settings.

Barrick and Mount (1991) found Extraversion to be a valid predictor of performance in management and sales jobs, which have a high social component related to inﬂuencing or leading others (sales: (cid:1) = .15, n = 2,316; management: (cid:1) = .18, n = 11,335). Stewart (1996) also illustrated that Extraversion is quite sensitive to the situational inﬂuence of rewards. In this study, Extraversion was related to higher performance only on performance dimen- sions that were explicitly rewarded (new sales or customer rela- tions). Empirical ﬁndings thus suggest that Extraversion is related to performance in situations where one can acquire and maintain status (that is, in competitive situations).
