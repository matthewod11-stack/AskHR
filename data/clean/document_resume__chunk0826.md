# Concluding Remarks

Designing, developing, and implementing an effective perforniance appraisal system is not an easy task. In fact, the Southern Union process at times could have been described as difficult, confusing, controveisial, and time-consuming. But, "difficulty and confusion" were addressed early from the process by retaining individuals with pro- fessional expertise in implementing a sophisticated, comprehensive appraisal system. "Controversy" was mitigated through total institutional cc mmitment, involvement, negotiation, and communication. As far as the "time-consuming" aspect of the process, this is one factor which simply cannot nor ever will be eliminated. In fact, maintenance of the appraisal process at Southern Union continues to be time-consuming. Effective performance appraisal systems require continuous refinement and modification because position descriptions will be rearranged, errors will be found, new positions will evolve, and humans will change for the sake of change. Change, therefore, is a necessary ingredient in the evolution of an effective system of appraisal.
