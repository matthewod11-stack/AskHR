## Stress Reduction Interventions Related to Life/Work Issues

As shown in Table ., due to the combination of an increasing number of dual- income and single-parent families, a tight job market, and a trend toward longer workdays, many organizations have made efforts to ensure that their employees maintain a balance between work and private life. Such efforts are important, as research suggests that employees with work–family conflicts are several times more likely to suffer from mood, anxiety, and substance-abuse disorders than are employ- ees without such conflicts (Frone, ). Though organizational efforts to reduce private life–work conflicts are designed to help employees reduce their stress levels and thus increase their mental and physical health, they are also motivated by the fact that employees with such outside concerns as child and elder care are more prone to miss work and are less productive than employees without such concerns.
