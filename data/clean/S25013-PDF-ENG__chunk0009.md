People tend to think that humans’ decision-making is less of a black

box than algorithms’, but that belief is unfounded. Psychologists have

shown that people have little insight into what other people are

thinking; instead they use heuristics to interpret human behavior. In

one study where people were asked to describe the process by which AI

or human physicians diagnosed cancer after examining skin scans, for

instance, participants realized that their grasp of the human diagnostic

procedure was not as strong as they had presumed. This realization

made them less biased against using medical AI.

Explanations of how AI tools work can increase their acceptance, but

not all explanations are eﬀective. Researchers have found that people

prefer explanations about why an AI tool did something (for instance,

they would rather know that an autonomous car braked because there

was an obstacle ahead) to simple explanations of what the AI did (for

instance, that it activated the vehicle’s braking system and brought the
