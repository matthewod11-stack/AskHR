The style of explanations plays a crucial role too. Those that use

comparative reasoning—outlining why certain alternatives weren’t

chosen—increase trust more than explanations that don’t. For instance,

one study found that an explanation that described in detail why an AI

system categorized a tumor as malignant instead of as benign was seen

as more credible than one that simply said the tumor resembled other

tumors (even if both explanations may be true). Essentially, the most

convincing explanations are those that articulate the reasons behind the

decision made as well as why alternatives were dismissed.

Because the best-performing AI models are typically more complex

and harder to explain than other models, managers may want to

ﬁrst introduce simpler models into their organizational processes—

especially when getting buy-in from people is important. Consider
