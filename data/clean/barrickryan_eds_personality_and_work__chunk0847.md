variables (LePine, Hollenbeck, Ilgen, & Hedlund, 1997). In addi- tion, type of task may moderate the relationships. For example, group-level Extraversion appears to be related curvilinearly to team performance on creative problem-solving tasks (Barry & Stewart, 1997) and linearly to team performance on compensatory tasks (Barrick et al., 1998). Although the complexities of the relation- ships are almost overwhelming, they must be reﬂected in our mod- els of performance.

The research in this area highlights the importance of con- ducting a mission analysis (akin to job analysis at the individual level) that takes into account required group-level (team) compe- tencies, group-level criterion variables, type and form of the rela- tionships, and situational variables. Studies in this area also highlight the difﬁculties of operationalizing group-level predictor variables.
