## TRACING PROGRESS THROUGH THE WRITTEN RECORD

One way of tracing the history of a discipline is to examine that discipline’s documents. In the case of educational psy- chology, there are two primary document resources: profes- sional journals and academic textbooks. One of the ﬁrst reviews of textbooks was by Worcester (1927). Worcester’s 1927 review found an “amazing lack of agreement” in the content of educational psychological texts. One author, for example, used 30% of the textbook space for psychology and tests in primary-school subjects, while other authors ne- glected these topics entirely. There was also marked dissimi- larity in the discussions of laboratory practices of educational psychologists, with some focusing on, for example, testing of individual differences, statistical methods, and studies of memory, while others investigated transfer of learning and intelligence testing. Most of the approximately 37 different textbooks used among the labs were, in practice, general psychology texts (Worcester, 1927). And, as Charles (1976) notes, things were not much different even 25 years later. A 1949 comparison of texts used in educational psychology classes revealed that while one author devoted a full 20% to the topic of intelligence testing, another author devoted a scant 1.5% to this same topic.

Content analyses have also been performed on the found- ing journal in the ﬁeld of educational psychology, the Jour- nal of Educational Psychology. In an examination of 641 articles reviewed by decade from 1910 to 1990, O’Donnell and Levin (2001) delimited different “central themes.” They found that articles in the teaching category decreased from 30% to a mere 0.03% and that articles in the intelligence- testing category dropped from 13.3% to 0.0%. Articles in the learning category, however, increased by almost 47 per- in a centage points—from 13.3% to 60%. Ball (1984), content analysis of articles published during the ﬁrst 75 years of the Journal of Educational Psychology, found sim- ilar trends.

Ball notes that while there has continued to be a strong research content core, the emphasis of the research has shifted over the years. For example, in the early days of the Journal of Educational Psychology, the emphasis was on practical issues related to teachers and teaching; the 1940s and 1950s ushered in increased interest in personal and social issues; and the 1970s and beyond reﬂected a growth in theo- retical rather than strictly practical areas, especially in moti- vation and psycholinguistics. Ball (1984) also noted a trend toward both more multi-authored articles and longer articles; additionally, he noted that the number of women in the ﬁeld had increased substantially.
