you can provide employees with conﬁdential support, counseling,

and advice. While these resources can be expensive, workplace

Establish an ombuds ofﬁce.

An ombuds is an oﬀ-the-record resource currently used by at least 13%

of US companies to provide information and guidance to employees considering reporting. Because they are not an oﬃcial reporting

channel, ombuds can talk candidly to employees about fears and

concerns and walk them through the options available to them,

including but not limited to making a formal report. Importantly,

ombuds serve as an alternative to legalistic hearing processes and allow

employees some degree of ﬂexibility in communicating their complaint

to the individual(s) accused.

Create anonymous formal reporting channels that both protect reporters and inform organizational change.

A large range of anonymous reporting tools are available to companies,

including hotlines, chatbots, website forms, and phone apps. One

company in the food industry with a few thousand employees partnered

with a third-party platform for their anonymous reporting and found

that after 6 months reporting rates had increased by 30%. Faith in

the new anonymous channel led employees to come forward earlier

with issues that previously may not have been reported for months,

if ever, allowing the organization to address problems before they

developed into major incidents. While each tool has its own strengths

and companies should design their solutions to best ﬁt their own needs,

eﬀective solutions (whether fully internal, through an external platform,

or a mix of the two) should be:

- Convenient, allowing employees to quickly make and submit reports

with the desired level of detail, including witnesses if relevant.
