didn’t. He recalled, “The person who owned a much more substantial stake in the company generally took the view ‘We should do the right thing. We’ve got to grow the value of the business and the value of the equity, and that will be my compensation.’” The CEO with a smaller stake tended to have “much more of a professional­manager orientation, with an eye to cash compensation. And there was always a little bit of a tussle around whether the objectives were truly achieved or not.”

Other directors argued that while stock rewards have benefits, they’re not perfect incentives. One commented, “If you gave somebody stock options in 2008, 10 years later those stock options were hugely valuable no matter what the company did, because the market came up. A rising market floats all boats. But if you gave somebody stock options in, say, 2006, no matter what the company did, no matter how well it grew or how profitable it was, by 2008, those options were significantly underwater. And it probably took almost the next seven or eight years for them to get back to where they were. So stock options are a very flawed instrument,

because you really want something that gives value if your company does better than its peers.” For that reason several directors we spoke with argued that stock awards should be linked, in part, to outperforming comparable firms.

Individual versus group. On average 29% of comp is based on individual performance and 71% on the perfor­ mance of the organization (such as a division) or company. A firm’s culture and values will have an impact on the amounts tied to the two kinds of performance. “I” compa­ nies—in which there’s a high degree of personal accountabil­ ity and individuals have the ability to influence results—tend to link more compensation to individual accomplishments. Such companies tend to be human­capital­centric and highly competitive—think of consulting, law, investment banking, and asset management firms, where partners are often val­ ued for bringing in business. “We” companies tend to focus more on organizational results—typically financial goals or shareholder returns. In those companies—often manufac­ turing, technology, or other product­driven businesses—firm performance is more stable and predictable.
