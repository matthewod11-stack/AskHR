# ineffective performance.

Since excellence is idiosyncratic and cannot be learned by studying

failure, we can never help another person succeed by holding her

performance up against a prefabricated model of excellence, giving her

feedback on where she misses the model, and telling her to plug the

gaps. That approach will only ever get her to adequate performance.

Point out the grammatical ﬂaws in an essay, ask the writer to ﬁx the

ﬂaws, and while you may get an essay with good grammar, you won’t get

a piece of writing that transports the reader. Show a new teacher when

her students lost interest and tell her what to do to ﬁx this, and while

you may now have a teacher whose students don’t fall asleep in class,

you won’t have one whose students necessarily learn any more.
