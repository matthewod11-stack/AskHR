humor (e.g., Holmes & Marra, 2002a; Vinton, 1989) or even more aggressive humor (e.g., Rodrigues & Collinson, 1995) was directed upward through the hierarchy. Therefore, the literature is somewhat inconsistent in predicting who uses humor, and in what form, but it is clear that humor plays a role in either maintaining or subverting authority relationships.

The notion of power distance might be particularly useful for explaining these apparent inconsistencies. We consider power distance from two perspectives: (1) the perspective of the broader societal culture in which an organization is embedded, and (2) the perspective of a particular organiza- tion, and its cultural norms regarding the perceived legitimacy or prestige associated with rank and formal status. In societal cultures that are low in power distance, authority, rank, and status are not sacrosanct, and thus, can be challenged through the use of humor by individuals with lower status without violating societal norms. In societal cultures that are high in power distance, however, individuals will likely be hesitant to challenge authority through any means. In organizations that are high in power distance, where status and hierarchy are revered (rank has its privileges), individuals are sanctioned to maintain status and hierarchy relationships. Because main- tenance of such relationships is mostly in the interests of the managers or supervisors who are in power, we might expect them to take active steps to retain power through the use of humor or otherwise. In contrast, in low power distance organizations, hierarchy is largely a matter of efﬁciency and functionality (somebody has to make the decisions), and/or expertise (people are supposedly promoted because of job speciﬁc knowledge or abilities). Therefore, titles and other indicators of formal status do not necessarily convey informal status. In such contexts, the use of aggressive or otherwise negative types of humor directed at subordinates would likely be counter- normative.

Considered jointly, the classiﬁcation of organizations and societies as high or low on power distance can provide the basis for some interesting and testable predictions. In low power distance organizations, embedded in low power distance societies, we suggest that humor might be especially common. Individuals with less formal status or power are ‘‘allowed’’ by both the society and the organizational culture to challenge the authority of managers or supervisors, and thus might do so out in the open with lighthearted or teasing humor intended to deﬂate formal status differences (Vinton, 1989). Supervisors or managers with more formal status are likely to be discouraged from using more aggressive forms of humor that serve to emphasize control and status distinctions. However, ‘‘teasing to get things done’’ (Vinton, 1989) might be used to help save face by masking the
