# Coding

Many software engineers are power users of AI. They use it for debugging, generating (cid:17)rst-draft code in unfamiliar languages, porting code from one language to another, and rubber-ducking their code. In the past two years, AI’s capabilities in math, science, and coding across many languages have signi(cid:17)cantly improved, and many tools now even o(er real-time code previews$

We’re also seeing many non-coders take up coding with the assistance of AI tools. Just by using natural language, marketers and (cid:17)nance teams are able to build Python scripts to automate processes, SQL queries to retrieve data, or even visualizations with front-end code for websites or internal presentations.

Coding use cases to start with:
