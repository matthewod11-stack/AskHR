If a multiple-hurdle approach is usually less expensive, why is it not always used instead of a multiple-cutoff approach? First, many of the tests cited above take time to conduct or score. For example, it might take a few weeks to run a background check or a few days to interpret a psychological screening. There- fore, the tests usually must be administered on several occasions, and an appli- cant would have to miss several days of work to apply for a particular job. Because

people often cannot or will not take more than one day off from one job to apply for another, many potentially excellent applicants are lost before testing begins.

Second, research has shown that in general the longer the time between submission of a job application and the hiring decision, the smaller the number of African American applicants who will remain in the applicant pool (Arvey, Gordon, Massengill, & Mussio, ). African American populations have higher unemployment rates than Whites, and people who are unemployed are more hurried to obtain employment than people with jobs. Thus, because the multiple- hurdle approach takes longer than multiple-cutoff, it may bring an unintended adverse impact, and affirmative action goals may not be met.
