## HBR / Digital Article / It’s OK to Fail, but You Have to Do It Right

ADI IGNATIUS:

Furthering that, here’s a question from Benny from California. What’s

the best way to speak to subordinates after a failure to boost morale and

communicate that, “This was a good failure. It’s OK”?

AMY EDMONDSON:

I’m going to say “honestly.” You can be honest about, “Wow, this was

disappointing for all of us, and let’s get everything we can out of it.

Let’s learn as much as possible.” And in fact, given that something

substantial that goes wrong nearly always has multifaceted aspects to

it, it’s helpful to have a thoughtful and data-driven conversation about

what happened. Not “Who did it?”, but, “What happened?”

We may go around the team and ask, “What did you see?” And we’re

really looking for what happened, what contributed to that, and that’s

both commission and omission, things that you did that may have

contributed, things that you didn’t do that may have helped. It’s

a thoughtful, deliberately learning-oriented conversation designed to

help us be better next time.

ADI IGNATIUS:

How do you reenergize your team these days? How do we reenergize our

team particularly now, in 2023, where it feels like there’s a lot of stuﬀ

swirling around?

AMY EDMONDSON:

It starts with personally taking the time to reconnect with your own

sense of purpose for doing the job, the role that you are currently doing.
