At EliteMed Pharma Co., a divide exists between the R&D department

and the process design team. In this organization, R&D creates

processes in the lab, and the process design team is tasked with

scaling these processes for real-world manufacturing. R&D believes that

process design engineers lack the expertise to fully understand the

complexities involved and hence they share limited reasoning about

the lab design. Since scaling up requires adjustments to account for the limitations and eﬃciencies of large-scale equipment, without the

details on lab design, the process design team is forced to rely on

a lengthy trial-and-error approach to create functional designs. This

selective sharing of information highlights the challenges posed by

elitist silos, where knowledge hoarding undermines the organization’s overall eﬃciency and innovation.

Elitist silos can be diﬃcult to diagnose because the root cause often

lies in subtle power dynamics. While the “elite” department operates

without disruption, the dependent department faces frequent rework, delays, and overall ineﬃcient performance. The frustration arising

from these challenges leads to higher attrition rates, lower morale,

and diminished job satisfaction. When disparities in performance,
