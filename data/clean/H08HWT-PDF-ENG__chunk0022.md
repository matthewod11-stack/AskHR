- 2. Frame prompts around “What if” and “How might we” questions

Instead of asking direct questions, prompt with open-ended

possibilities. For instance, instead of asking, “How can I improve

productivity?” try, “What if I could approach productivity in an

unconventional way — what might that look like?”

- 3. Embrace ambiguity and curiosity in prompts

Training ourselves to prompt without a precise endpoint in mind allows

AI to generate responses that might surprise us. Prompts like “What

might I be overlooking in my approach to X?” open doors to insights we

hadn’t considered.

- 4. Use prompts to explore rather than to solve

Many prompts focus on solutions. Shifting toward exploration allows

for deeper insight generation. For example, “Let’s explore the future

of leadership if AI had a seat on the board or in the C-Suite — what

changes might we see in our work, roles, and in corporate culture?”

- 5. Chain prompts to develop ideas iteratively

Rather than stopping at the ﬁrst answer, ask follow-up questions that

deepen the response toward more complex and visionary responses. If

AI suggests an idea, build on it with questions like, “What would this

look like in 5 years?” or “How might this approach change the future of

how companies operate?”

- 6. Think metaphorically or analogically

Training our brains to use metaphor or analogy in prompts open up

creative pathways. For instance, instead of asking for productivity tips,
