HR needs to be emphasised in co-ordinating and facilitating the process. The Civil Aviation Authority recommends that the appraisal process should be regularly reviewed and adjusted if necessary, but warns against continually changing the scheme (Wolff, 2005). Cocca et al. (2010) also state that for effective performance management, the system needs to be dynamic and fluid to respond to changing business circumstances so that performance measures always remain relevant. They note, however, that few organisations often have the processes in place for monitoring their systems. Performance management systems consist of a collection of five elements: people, procedures, data, software, and hardware (Wettstein and Kueng 2002 , cited in Cocca, 2010) and all of these elements need to be monitored to assess the effectiveness of a system (Cocca, 2010, p.188).

IES has conducted numerous evaluations of performance management systems as managers are often still quite poor at evaluating performance-with-evidence, so they often fall back on the tried and tested methods of which individuals they consider to be the most reliable, the most visible or, perhaps subconsciously, whom they feel most comfortable dealing with.

IES has found that the outcome of this is that:

(cid:1) People who work in non-standard patterns in the organisation can get poorer performance outcomes (eg part-times workers, the majority of whom are women).

(cid:1) People from black and minority ethnic groups tend to get poorer performance
