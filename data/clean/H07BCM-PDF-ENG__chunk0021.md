# The Right Answer

Our society teaches that there are “right” and “wrong” answers from

our schooldays right through to the workplace. But, often, there are

no discernible right answers when looking out over the unknown of a

reinvented life or career. Executives who have conﬁdent replies at the

ready in the context of their current roles become suddenly silent when

they’re asked about their personal futures.

As a scientist, Sam had been educated to ﬁnd the right answer to the

problems in front of him. After 20 years as a chemist in a large German

ﬁrm, he started to feel ready for a change of direction and yet he found

himself searching for the elusive right answer to what that direction

should be. As a result, he remained in his role despite the feeling within

him that something needed to shift.
