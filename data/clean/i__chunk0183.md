# 2.10.1 Current State

According to HR Business Review by Harward (2016) concerning different aspects of current

PA practice, 54% of HR expert respondents consider data quality to be the biggest hindrance

of PA, which is also ranked as the most significant barrier. 44% of respondents shared the view

that investment in analytical systems among companies needs to be more adequately invested.

McCartney and Fu (2021) raise questions about data quality after conducting a systematic

literature review on recent PA peer-reviewed articles. They also conclude that data quality is

one of the significant barriers to organizations conducting PA as low-quality or accurate data

results in unreliable insight and suggestions, which causes financial loss and consequences to

business performance. In other words, the accuracy and reliability of analytical results depend

on the quality of the input data. Ensuring accurate and high-quality data inputs is essential to

obtain meaningful and trustworthy insights from analytical processes. Nevertheless, numerous

organizations continue to face challenges when it comes to having trust and confidence in their

Human Resources (HR) and people-related data. McCartney and Fu also quoted a report by

Deloitte (2017), which studies over 10,000 business and HR leaders; merely 8% of surveyed

HR leaders indicated confidence in their ability to utilize the data available to them effectively.

As discussed in the previous chapter, People Analytics (PA) necessitates data of varying types

and formats. This data must be collected from diverse sources and systems spanning multiple

business functions, making HR data <vast, messy, and constantly changing= (McCartney & Fu,

39

2021). Therefore, the very first stage of PA: Data collection, faces challenges while requiring

skills to collect and manipulate data.

Not only data quality, data management, and governance are issues for PA. McCartney and Fu

quoted the work of Minbaeva (2018), <Most firms do not know what types of data are already

available to them or in what form. In fact, most firms do not have the answers to some basic

questions: What data do we have? Where do we store it? How was the data collected?=.

Consequently, this leads to an inadequate volume of data required for the successful

implementation of PA, as Fernandez and Gallardo-Gallardo (2020) claim that <there may be

insufficient data to be able to <ask the right questions.=
