## HBR / Digital Article / Overcome Your Fear of Giving Feedback

Here are three of the most common pre-conceived notions I hear that

contribute to feedback anxiety, and what to do about them.

- 1. The feedback conversation is going to be long and drawn out.

Let’s say you have a colleague with whom you have a good working

relationship. You care about the other person’s perspectives, and they

care about yours. You have observed that they care about the quality of

their work, and the impact they have on other people and projects. In

addition, when you’ve given them feedback in the past, they’ve received

it without defensiveness and made the changes you requested.

Guess what? You’re likely working with a “feedback magnet” —

someone who readily accepts and acts on feedback. When you’re

working with a colleague like this, you don’t necessarily need to have

long, drawn out feedback conversations. You might be able to give

fast feedback — simply sharing the behavior or performance you’re

observing.

For example, you might say “I noticed that you weren’t able to answer

the regulators’ question about new risks in our meeting yesterday”

— and then stop talking. If you’re working with a feedback magnet,

they’re likely to acknowledge their misstep, and oﬀer their own plan for

remedying it. For example, “I know. I wasn’t as prepared as I needed to

be for that question. I’m following up today with the regulators, and for

the next meeting, I’ll have done a deep dive into new risks so that I’m

ready.” And then, you can thank them for their proactivity, and oﬀer to

make yourself available if and when they need you.

Of course, not every feedback conversation you’ll have will be with

someone who is self-aware, self-motivated, and self-directed. In those

cases, you have a longer conversation ahead of you. But don’t assume

that every conversation needs to be long or multifaceted.
