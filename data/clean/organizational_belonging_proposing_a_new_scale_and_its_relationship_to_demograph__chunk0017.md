# Literature review

Prior conceptual and empirical work related to OB

OB is not organizational support, organizational culture, or organizational Commitment OB is related to but distinct from Perceived Organizational Support (POS), Organizational Culture (OC), and Organizational Commitment (OrgC). POS is the employee’s perception that the organization values their contri- bution and cares about their well-being (Kurtessis et al., 2017), as demon- strated by fair employee treatment, supervisor support, organizational rewards, and favorable job conditions. OC has been defined as “those things that are valued and rewarded within your company—that is, the pat- tern of beliefs and expectations shared by members, and their resulting behaviors” (Chatman, Caldwell, O’Reilly, & Doerr, 2014).

Belonging refers to a relation, where people feel valued by another person, group, and/or organization, which involves creating a sense of identification with that person and/or entity, through forming social bonds (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Belonging is a multidimensional con- struct because it involves our identity (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, occupation) interacting with different people (and their identi- ties), social contexts and places, including organizations (May, 2011).

Critiquing prior empirical work on OB Knapp, Smith, and Sprinkle (2014, p. 274) defined OB as the “perception of an intimate association with the organization as demonstrated by a sense of: perceived insider status, psychological ownership, and organizational identification.” Perceived insider status (Stamper & Masterson, 2002) is the
