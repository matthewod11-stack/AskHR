Employees’ commitment is an individual’s emotional attachment to the identification with and the involvement in the organization. This phenomenon fosters productivity, enhanced relationship, devotion to achievement of organizational goals, customer satisfaction, organization citizenship behavior, quality of products and services, and loyalty to the organization (Collings & Mellahi, 2009; De-Meuse, 2009; Barkhuizen, 2014; Lockwood, 2006).

Employee Satisfaction The organization determinants of employee satisfaction plays very important role (Farah et al., 2018). In an organization, proper organizing and managing the organizational variables can increase employee satisfaction (Balouch, 2006). Talent focused variables of organizational development, policies of compensation and benefit, promotion and career development, job satisfaction, job security, working environment and conditions, relationship with supervisors, work groups, leadership styles, and performance management determine employee satisfaction (Bakka, 2006; Herzberg F. , 1968; Warren R., 1989).

Employee Engagement According Cooke (2014) the employee engagement is the active and full performance of an employee or individual’s cognitive, emotional and physical energies and efforts. The level of engagements is observed by the energy and efforts that an employee applies and that level of engagement highlight his or her motivational dimension of the engagement. These aspects reflect a positive and productive behavior that is congruent with organizational strategic objectives (Farah et al., 2018; Meyer & Allen, 1991; Allen & Mayer, 1990).

Perceived Organizational Support Perceived organizational support refers to the extent to which an organization gives importance to their employees or how much an organization values their employee’s contribution and how much the organization cares about the well-being of their employees, however high perceived organizational support will lead towards the improvement in work behavior and attitudes and it will affect the work in positive and effective way. Employees will feel owned and cared and they will be obliged to pay and contribute in the production of the organization and to achieve the targets and goals of both individual and organization (Meyer & Allen, 1991).

Employee Performance Job performance refers to how good and effectively or resourcefully an individual takes action and contribute with his or her behaviors (Dries, 2013). Performance is a positive or effective contribution of an employee or individual for the performance of the organization (Mensah, 2015). Task performance refers to the behaviors that contribute to the core duties and responsibilities (Sageer, Rafat, & Agarwal, 2012; Meyer & Allen, 1991). Task performance indicates the actions that are part of the formal duties and reward system that has been made by the organization and it refers to the requirements that are specified and mentioned in the job description of an employee (Sageer, Rafat, & Agarwal, 2012). Contextual performance refers to the factors and issues that are not directly concerned or not directly part of the job of an employee. It is the psychological and social mind setting that an employee has and acts with his or her behaviors. Contextual performance involves the behavioral patterns and factors involving extra role behavior both towards coworkers and organization (Sageer, Rafat, & Agarwal, 2012). Adaptive performance focus on organizational and employees’ agility. and responsiveness to the changing external environment and aligning with the changes in proactive manner (Rich LePine, & Crawford, 2010).
