manager, you can create a space in which people feel saferdisclosing and asking for what they need. You can encouragediversity and ensure that differences are valued — rather thanfeared — on your team.Based on the findings in our study, we recommend some practicesfor new managers to create a more inclusive workplace.1) Don’t generalize disabilities.It’s common for non-disabled people to misunderstand what itmeans to live with a specific condition. The reality is that twopeople with the same disability may have very differentexperiences. For instance, two colleagues who both have chronicmigraines might have different triggers or discomforts. Similarly,a generalized anxiety disorder can

include a variety of symptomsthat show up and manifest in entirely different ways dependingon the person.This means your knowledge of a disability and what it looks orfeels like may not correspond to your colleague’s experience of thecondition. Don’t debate them on this point. Making assumptionsabout someone’s abilities can cloud your judgment and result inunconscious bias or microaggressions. As a leader, your role inthis scenario is to listen. Spend time understanding whatsymptoms show up for your team members and when, how thosesymptoms impact their work, and what you can do to supportthem.Our research found that managers that were empathetic, patient,and willing to listen to their team member’s experiences andaccommodate their requests were more successful leaders. Theirteams reported a 63% increase in well-being and 71% increase inengagement compared to the average.
