## Learning Goals Versus a Learning Goal Orientation

Arguably the most remarkable ﬁnding with regard to the goal setting theory since 1990 is that it is as applicable to goals primed in the subconscious as it is to consciously set goals (Latham, 2018). Additive effects on perfor- mance of these two types of goals have been obtained in both laboratory (Ganegoda, Latham, & Folger, 2011; Stajkovic, Locke, & Blair, 2006) and ﬁeld experiments (Shantz & Latham, 2009). A context-speciﬁc primed goal has been shown to lead to higher job performance than a general one (Latham & Piccolo, 2012). On a task that is complex for people, a primed learn- ing goal led to higher performance than a primed performance goal (Chen & Latham, 2014). Latham, Brcic, and Steinhauer (2017) found that a goal can be primed for the subse- quent conscious choice of a difﬁcult versus an easy goal as well as effort expended. Choice and effort, as noted earlier, are mediators in the goal setting theory. Latham et al. (2017) also found that the more difﬁcult the goal primed in the subconscious, the higher the goal that is consciously set. Moreover, a conscious self-set goal partially mediated the subconscious goal– performance relationship. A self-report measure of conscientiousness moderated this relation-

A learning goal, a state, is not to be confused with a learning goal orientation conceived by Dweck (1986) as a quasitrait. Setting a speciﬁc, high goal provides direction for one’s behavior; it serves as a motivator for performance attain- ment. The importance of not blurring the dis- tinction between these two concepts was shown empirically by Seijts, Latham, Tasa, and Latham (2004). Using a complex simulation in

Two protagonists, Latham and Erez, used a mutually respected mediator, Locke, to conduct four experiments to shed light on their conﬂicting ﬁndings.
