## R.E. Lewis, R.J. Heckman / Human Resource Management Review 16 (2006) 139–154

management process to ensure it is valid — that it accurately identifies high performers?” nearly no hands were raised. (Lewis, Heckman, & Tuzinski, 2004).

This is an admittedly unscientific result but raises questions regarding the extent to which benchmarking, typical HR practices, or the drive to integrate HR and financial systems produce metrics that make sense. Even a well-researched process such as performance appraisal with dimensional issues (Vishwesveran, Schmidt, & Ones, 2005), unreliability (Vishwesveran, Ones, & Schmidt, 2005), and sensitivity to rater goals (Cleveland et al., 1989; Murphy et al., 2004) seems to be commonly used to identify “talent”. Rather than create new metrics it might be useful to investigate applying standard metrics in a new manner. Boudreau and Ramstad (2005) note that metrics with influence in business are those that apply to decisions wherever they are made, not just to the function where they are developed. For instance, line managers who invest in projects with low return on investment (a financial measure) do not get to blame finance for their poor decisions. Yet, HR practitioners know that a manager who experiences high turnover because of poor management or poor hiring will generally blame HR for the results.

No literature was found that examines processes for ensuring that metrics are fed back to decision-makers (hiring managers, supervisors, etc.) regarding the talent decisions they frequently make. The validity of managers' choices to send one person over another to a development program, to hire one person over another, or to nominate an individual for a high-potential talent pool are easily calculated, meaningful metrics that have the potential to markedly improve organizational talent decisions. How these measures can be reported, and the accountability framework needed to ensure action, remains unstudied.

- 7. Summary

Researchers have an opportunity to bring clarity and thought leadership to a popular topic that lacks coherence and rigor. TM as it is used is a term without value. By grounding TM in a strategic decision framework that clearly guides talent decisions, developing systems-level models that illustrate the multi-pool impacts of talent choices, and developing reliable, validity, and theoretically meaningful measures researchers can markedly improve the quality of talent conversations in organizations.
