## How Criteria Can Affect Perceptions of Value

Previous research has described creativity as “novelty that is useful,”

where novelty is deﬁned as the distance of departure from existing

oﬀerings or practices. The newer the idea, the harder it is to compare

to what already exists. In other words, the newer an idea, the less likely

there will be a common reference point or criteria by which to evaluate
