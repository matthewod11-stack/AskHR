## 7.2.2 Wage Preferences Can Depend on Reference Points u(w(xi) — r)

In the formalism above the utility of wages, u[w(x;)], does not depend on any special

point of reference. But most systems in the brain have a homeostatic dependence ona

set point or point of reference (e.g., hunger depends on what you have eaten recently;

sweating and shivering respond to deviations of body temperature from a set point).

If reactions to income tap similar psychophysical mechanisms, then people will care

a lot about their wages relative to psychologically natural benchmarks, requiring a

separate component of utility u(w(x;) ~ r) and a theory about what r is and how it

changes (see, for example, Bowman et al. 1999; Koszegi and Rabin 2004).

Bewley (Chapter 5, this volume) discusses evidence that workers compare current

earnings to previous earnings and dislike wage cuts, in traditional jobs where wages

are adjusted periodically, so r; = w;—1. (Firms anticipate this and are reluctant to

cut wages.) A similar reference dependence shows up in jobs where wages and hours

fluctuate daily. For example, inexperienced New York cab drivers, who can adjust

their daily hours, act as if they care about a daily income “target,” which leads to

5For example, law school applications rose for a few years after the hit TV show “LA Law” began in 1986 (see Torry 1996). The show portrayed law as fun and empowering, and law firms as sexy, vibrant

places to work. It is farfetched to think students are really Bayesian-updating based on new information

about the c(e) for law from a television show, because most pre-law students have a lot of information in

the first place, or can gather objective information, and the television show is not meant to be an accurate
