# How We Use It

The first step of putting design fiction into practice involves crafting

scenarios of possible futures. For example, in a project with a major

car insurance company, we analyzed information from urban mobility

trends, autopilot flight modes, Luc Besson’s notorious movie The Fifth

Element, and interviews with early electric car adopters to develop

scenarios of possible futures. These atypical data sources help spotlight

less obvious aspects that would otherwise remain unnoticed in the

strategizing process. In this example, from talking to an airline pilot

we understood how the risks will be shifting in an autonomous driving

ecosystem. Bumper shocks and losing control of the vehicle will not

happen anymore, but new risks such as system hacking and break down

of vital sensors will arise.
