# 206 Developmental Psychology

emphasis on behaviorist and normative development, its focus on experimental child psychology and social learning theory, was a sharp departure from the origins of the ﬁeld. What Cairns noted two decades ago is still true today: “An overview of the past suggests that today’s investigators are as much determined by history as they are makers of it. The major issues of the present appear to be, in a large measure, the same ones that thoughtful contributors to the science have addressed in the past” (Cairns, 1983, p. 90).

Why are we returning to the concerns of our distant past? One reason is that our forebears were wise in their choice of questions and raised enduring issues. Another reason is that, in the middle period, developmentalists took some detours away from the original goals of the ﬁeld in their enthusiasm for establishing a separate science on the basis of positivistic principles. The ﬁeld’s behavioristic focus promoted a prolif- eration of excellent methods and technological advances but ignored basic questions of biology, consciousness, and cogni- tion. Today, as the beneﬁciaries of both the early and the middle eras, we are in a position to ask again the old ques- tions and address them in more methodologically sophisti- cated ways.

THE BEGINNING YEARS (1880–1914)

The beginning years of the ﬁeld of development can be char- acterized in two ways. One way is to describe the ﬁgures who ﬁrst forged the ﬁeld; the other way is to describe their posi- tions in terms of modern theoretical distinctions.
