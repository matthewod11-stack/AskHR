## For example, a major ﬁnance institution’s HR director for the Asia-

Paciﬁc region was nervous about hosting a lunchtime talk about mental

health. “Asians don’t talk about mental health, because it is a private

matter,” she remembered being told by others in the region. Plus, being

Asian herself, she had been socialized for a long time to not talk about

such “shameful” topics, so was sensitive to the broader context around

the stereotype. But she wanted to encourage colleagues to think about

mental health as she knew it was important.
