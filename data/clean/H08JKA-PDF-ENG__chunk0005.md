What can these CLOs learn from their colleagues who feel more closely

connected to their company’s strategy? My interviews identiﬁed ﬁve

distinct practices they can adopt.

Apply an agile approach to developing learning programs.

Most companies take far too long to develop large workplace learning

programs. LinkedIn’s recent report found that between 2022 and 2024,

fewer than 5% had made it to their ﬁnal phase. These delays are likely to

increase the gap between workplace learning and strategic priorities —

and increase frustration among business stakeholders.

To speed up, some companies are adopting a more agile approach

to L&D programs, in which cross-functional teams of designers,

content developers, and business stakeholders collaborate on learning

experiences that are continuously improved with feedback and testing.

Standard Chartered is one company that’s adopted this approach.

Its L&D team went from having dedicated account managers serving

each line of business to having multidisciplinary teams who are more

able to “grasp all the creative possibilities” for a given learning need,

according to Dr. Amelie Villeneuve, the bank’s global head of learning.
