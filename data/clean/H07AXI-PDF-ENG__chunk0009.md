## HBR / Digital Article / How LinkedIn Redesigned Its HQ for Hybrid Work

we’ve put new thinking on hybrid work to the test in designing

LinkedIn’s 250,000 square foot global headquarters, called B1, on the

existing 29-acre campus in Silicon Valley.

Although this eﬀort started before the pandemic, we’ve worked together

to adapt our plans for this moment in work history. Through research,

design, and now the adoption of the new space, including norms around

its use, the process has been one of testing and reﬁnement — balancing

in-person, hybrid, and remote work in a way that supports employee

well-being while continuing to move the company forward.

Here are three of the central lessons we’ve learned so far.

Optimize the office for all use cases.

The oﬃce should accommodate diverse roles and preferences. For

working parents, that might be a station where they can do heads-down

work away from the distractions and responsibilities of home. For many Gen Z employees, the return to the oﬃce is a welcome opportunity to

ﬁnd what they’ve been largely missing during the pandemic — space

for in-person mentoring, learning opportunities, and growth. Most

employees are looking for places to build (or rebuild) the social capital

— which McKinsey deﬁnes as “the presence of networks, relationships,

shared norms, and trust” — that has eroded over the last two years.

That’s why LinkedIn’s new HQ incorporates spaces that accommodate

all of these use cases: focus, collaboration, learning, and socialization,

as well as rest. We oﬀer everything from a quiet library to a bustling

café, and employees can choose to work wherever they want whenever

they want. We learned during lockdown that productivity goes up when

workers have more personal agency. Workplace design has to allow

people to ﬁnd individualized routines and rhythms that feel good for

them. This includes working from home when that feels right.
