team’s holidays, festivals, and time off can be another helpful wayto show your respect.If you’re not sure what hours a colleague follows, you can askthem:

I’d like to plan our next meeting. Do you have ﬁxed hours foryour lunch break?

I’d like to plan the kickoﬀ meeting in the ﬁrst week of June. Canyou let me know what your working hours are this summer?

We plan to beta test in the week of July 1-5. Do you have anyholidays or are you taking any time oﬀ I should know about?

On a global team, it’s important to discuss the way you prefer towork, and open the door for others to share their preferences aswell. For example, when I begin to collaborate with newinternational colleagues, I’m open about the way I communicate,and the influence my culture may have on the interaction. InFrance, for example, we tend to interrupt each other duringconversations, but that can be considered impolite or distrustfulin American work cultures. Letting others know ahead of time canbe helpful to avoid any miscommunications.You can also ask your colleagues directly about theircommunication preferences. For example:

Do you prefer communicating via phone, email, or is instantmessaging better?

Are you comfortable being on video during our meetings?
