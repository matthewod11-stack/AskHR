# Matt Carlson

The generally accepted framework for working at a job is either you do

it or you don’t. The expectation is that, if you’re working, you’re fully

committed. All in. Giving it 110%, as the saying goes. Or else you’re

taking a full leave of absence to manage an illness, for example, or to

take a sabbatical.
