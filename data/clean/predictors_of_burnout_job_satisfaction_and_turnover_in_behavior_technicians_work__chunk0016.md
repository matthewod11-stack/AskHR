## Fig. 1 Results of systematic literature searches

portions of the samples in Gibson et al. (2009) and Griffith et al. (2014) were reported to have supervisor-level roles (e.g., lead therapist, supervisor).

To be included, the reviewed studies must have explored turn- over, burnout, and/or job satisfaction as a dependent variable. Burnout was explored most often and was included as a de- pendent variable in four of the studies (Gibson et al. 2009; Griffithetal.2014;Hurtetal.2013;KellyandBarnes-Holmes 2013). To evaluate burnout across participants, two of the included studies (Gibson et al. 2009; Griffith et al. 2014) used the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; Maslach et al. 1986). The MBI assesses three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion (i.e., feeling emotionally overextended by one’s occupation), depersonalization (feeling impersonal towards those receiving one’s services or care), and personal accom- plishment (feeling capable and successful in one’s occupa- tion). The remaining studies used different versions of the MBI to measure burnout. Kelly and Barnes-Holmes
