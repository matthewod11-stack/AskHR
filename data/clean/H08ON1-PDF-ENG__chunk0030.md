## key to the success of the cultural integration process. Their people

are directed to go to them with questions, and they are the ones

who must translate the big-picture vision of the integration into day-

to-day eﬀorts. (As one acquired employee relayed to us, whether

or not acquired employees felt heard during the integration process

depended entirely on their manager.) But, as we’ve seen in our work

and elsewhere, often mid-level managers are left on the periphery of

integration conversations. And while they are often quite motivated by

early integration announcements, their excitement tends to fade when

they aren’t given the information or tools they need to execute.
