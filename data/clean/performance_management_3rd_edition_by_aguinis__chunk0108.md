of understanding how the legal environment has a direct impact on performance management practices worldwide.

- Types of learning that can take place as part of the team development plan in the perform- ance planning stage (Chapter 11). This material will be useful in terms of providing a deeper understanding of specific interventions aimed at improving team learning and performance. Further, the following is a nonexhaustive list of specific topics that have been updated and

expanded in each chapter:

- The discussion of voice behavior (i.e., constructive criticisms that challenge the status quo and promote innovative improvements) as an important contribution of performance management systems, performance management’s contribution to minimizing employee misconduct, an expanded discussion of allowances, an expanded discussion of the four dif- ferent dimensions of fairness (i.e., procedural, distributive, interpersonal, and informa- tional justice), the additional strategic purpose of performance management systems as a catalyst for onboarding (i.e., processes helping new employees to transition from organiza- tional outsiders to organizational insiders), and the importance of implementing a system that is congruent with the cultural norms of the organization as well as the culture of the re- gion and country where the organization is located (Chapter 1).

- An expanded discussion of how rater accountability leads to improved accuracy in perform- ance ratings (Chapter 6).

- An expanded discussion of how to evaluate whether the performance management system is working as intended, and a new section on the implementation of online performance management systems (Chapter 7).

- A description of the performance review meetings as work meetings—each one with spe- cific purposes, the need to separate the performance review meetings to minimize negative surprises, an expanded discussion of how to deal with employee defensiveness during the performance review meeting, and the need to consider an employee’s personality (e.g., core self-evaluations) in the process of giving feedback (Chapter 9). • An expanded discussion of nonfinancial rewards (Chapter 10). • New material regarding challenges faced in implementing performance management with expatriate teams (Chapter 11).
