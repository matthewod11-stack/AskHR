2009). For instance, IBM Corporation’s recent promotion of an existing female employee to CEO, albeit this was a ﬁrst the 100-year-old company, speaks to equal opportunity; however, the exclusion of female members to a private golf club with instrumental ties to IBM and its past male CEOs speaks of cultural subordination, poten- tially undermining her actual legitimacy in the position. Also, consider an example from academia where males comprise a disproportionate share of tenured faculty despite a slightly higher proportion of females than males receiving Ph.D.’s (American Association of University Professors [AAUP] 2006). The explicit opportunity for advancement is available to both sexes, but the institu- (e.g., tionalized norms demanding work hours over an extended number of years) favor those not encumbered with childbearing and child- care—or historically cultural males (AAUP 2006). Some universities have counteracted this inadvertent cultural subordination with policy changes that go well beyond basic pregnancy leave, such as temporary modiﬁed work schedules for childcare (e.g., Stanford University), part time tenure-track positions (e.g., University of California, Berkeley), and extended tenure clocks (e.g., Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Of course preceding this advent was recognition for the need of such ‘‘recognition,’’ in other words, a broader understanding of equality such as presented herein.
