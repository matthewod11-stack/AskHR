## The Perspective Starting from “How the Brain Works”

My method for illustrating the possibilities now emerging for the second approach

will be to consider a few examples of striking developments in psychology and

their possible significance for economists’ views of organization. I have focused in

33] think this distinction raises important choices for economics: the economics of organization that meets the needs of economics’ other fields (finance, health, labor, macro, ...) may not need to take into account the full richness of contemporary psychological research, or the full complexity of what we see going on in real organizing. Or it may.... But “real economists” have far more wisdom about this question than I do, and so I will devote myself to extending the portrait of what I believe is going on, leaving for those within economics the problems of judging how much of the development needs to be assimilated, and of how that can be done without losing the inferential power of current theoretical formalizations.
