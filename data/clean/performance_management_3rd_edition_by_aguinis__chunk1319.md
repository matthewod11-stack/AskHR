# Summary Points

- Some important steps need to be taken before the performance management system is implemented. These include implementing a communication plan and an appeals process, which will help gain system acceptance; training for raters, which will programs help minimize errors in performance ratings; and pilot testing the system, which will allow revisions and changes to be made before the system is actually implemented. Careful attention to these presystem implementation steps will help improve the success of the system.

- The main goal of the communication plan is to gain support for the system.

A good communication plan addresses the following questions:

- What is performance management? What are its general goals? How have performance management systems been implemented in other organizations?

- How does performance management fit with the organizational strategy? • What are the tangible benefits of the performance management system for all parties involved?

- How does the system work? What are the various steps in the process? • What are the roles and responsibili- ties of each organizational member?
