In addition, by assessing only the positive or negative nature of the affective state, we miss the discrete emotional experience. Moods may be well captured by di- mensional reductions, but discrete emotions are not. In these kinds of data, we fail to discriminate among these different kinds of experiences.

Nonetheless, these data can help us make a few points about af- fective states. Simple observation of these data illustrates the mo- mentary and transient nature of affective states. They also show that individual affective experiences examined over time have distinc- tive patterns and that various parameters can be used to describe these patterns. For example, observers can see that individuals ap- pear to vary in their average levels of positive and negative affect. They also vary in the variability of affect itself, the intensity of peaks
