# CASE STUDIES AND LIFE HISTORIES IN PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY: A HISTORY OFAMBIVALENCE

Psychology is proud of its laboratories, with their apparatus for careful experimentation and measurement. It is proud also of its array of tests for measuring the individual’s performance in many directions. It is pleased when its data can be handled by mathematical and statistical methods. (Woodworth, 1929, pp. 7–8)

When Robert S. Woodworth revised his inﬂuential introduc- tory psychology text in 1929, he expanded his ﬁnal chapter on “personality”—“the individual as a whole, and his social ad- justments” (Woodworth, 1929, p. 552), citing several recent studies involving personality tests. Woodworth also revised his treatment of “the methods of psychology” (p. 6), includ- ing a new discussion of the “case history method” (p. 8). However, the status of this method in Woodworth’s hier- archy of methods was clear: It belonged at the bottom. Woodworth ﬁrst described the experimental method, “pre- ferred as the most trustworthy way of observing the facts”

The authors would like to thank William McKinley Runyan for his helpful suggestions.
