Measure results. Finally, you’ll want to conﬁrm that the return-to-oﬃce

mandate is doing what it’s supposed to. “Continuing to take a look at

the policy shows you’re willing to use data to inform decisions,” says

Markman. He recommends talking with upper management before the

mandate is in place, to determine clear success criteria for it.

Once it’s up and running, keep an eye on metrics like productivity and

absenteeism — as well as retention. Research from Gartner found that

the intent to stay among knowledge workers was 8% lower at companies

with strict RTO mandates. For high-performing employees, it was 16%

lower. Pay attention to how long it takes your team to get things done

and if it’s tougher to hire with the mandate in place.

Then, take a good, hard look at the data. “It could show that

your strategies are working and that everyone’s still motivated and

engaged,” says Kulik. “Or it might reveal that people were actually more

productive working from home.” The goal is to ﬁnd a balance between

company policies and your people’s needs, adds Markman. “Make sure

the mandate makes sense for your team,” he advises. If it doesn’t, be

prepared to adjust or revisit.
