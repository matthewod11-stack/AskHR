Individuals’ perceptions of gender inequality can cause stress to repeated cases of gender discrimination and worry that one can be a victim of gender inequality. Together, these consequences call for a more longitudinal empirical research that may identify concrete actions that should be taken into force in order to eradicate both the perceived gender inequality and the actual one.

To conclude, I would like to mention that more studies should investigate the issue of individuals’ perceptions of overall gender inequality because a broader analysis of individuals’ perceptions and opinions may enlarge our understanding of the reasons and peculiarities of gender inequality. This may, in turn, provide an alternative solution for eliminating gender inequality not only in Finland but elsewhere.
