# HBR / Digital Article / For Female Founders, Fundraising Only from Female VCs Come…

Interestingly, research has identiﬁed similar eﬀects with respect to aﬃrmative action. When people are told that a female employee was an aﬃrmative action hire, they perceive her as less competent than equally qualiﬁed men or women who were not aﬃrmative action hires. Even

if two women have objectively identical levels of competence, just the knowledge that one was hired as part of an aﬃrmative action program is

enough to make her seem less competent.

So, what does this mean for female founders looking to raise capital?

We are not suggesting that women should never raise capital from other

women. Female investors might be more responsive to female founders,

and more able to see their potential. Networking between women can

also be more comfortable and less fraught, and a female founder may be

more likely to establish a trusting mentorship relationship with a female

VC, which can bring substantial long-term beneﬁts to both.

However, this can be a risky strategy when it comes to a startup’s long-

term success. There are still very few female investors, and they tend to

be concentrated in funds that focus on earlier-stage investments, where

risk is higher and funds invested are smaller. Today, female VCs simply do not control suﬃcient assets to continue to invest in female-led ﬁrms

as they scale. This means that female founders will ultimately need to

attract male investors in order to grow — and if you’re a woman, our

research shows that’s a lot easier to do if you raise at least some capital

from men from the start. As one female founder we spoke to put it:

I think there’s deﬁnitely a problem, if you’re a female entrepreneur,

backed by a female investor, and you want to get more capital, and

now the only people around the table are these two women. It’s almost

like, you’d want to do the hard thing ﬁrst, and get a few men brought
