# competent.

This is because of an eﬀect psychologists call attribution bias: the

tendency to assume that someone’s identity or character, rather than

outside factors, are responsible for the situation they’re in. When people

see that a female founder has a male investor, they assume she must

have received his investment because she is competent, and her startup

is strong. But when people see that a female founder has a female

investor, they attribute her investment success to her gender rather

than her competence. As a result, new potential investors assume that

a female founder is less competent if they see that she has only been

backed by female investors — regardless of her actual qualiﬁcations.
