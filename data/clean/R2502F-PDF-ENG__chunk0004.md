panese executive oﬀers an instructive example. Instead of assuming

that his counterpart would exhibit common Japanese cultural traits

## such as a preference for indirect communication, formality, or long

investments in relationship building, the British negotiator observed

how she actually behaved.

From the start, he saw that she was extremely friendly, shook his hand,

greeted him in English with a slight American accent, and explained

that she valued quick decision-making and innovation, having worked

at a tech startup in Silicon Valley for many years prior to creating her

own venture in Japan. She was candid, quick to share ideas, and clearly

signaled her intention to collaborate. Noticing those traits, the British

negotiator reciprocated with an equally open, collaborative style, which

helped them establish a strong working rapport.

# Identify Your Counterpart’s Intentions

All negotiations should begin with the question, “Does my counterpart

want to work with me or against me?” The role culture will play in the

negotiation is largely determined by the answer to this question.

If the counterpart is a win-win or, better still, a value negotiator—

that is, someone who is ready to pursue his or her goals without the use of power—cultural diﬀerences become operational challenges to

be solved together. But if the counterpart is a win-lose or, worse, a

power negotiator—ready to use whatever power is in his or her arsenal

to secure negotiation success—the person will harbor adversarial

intentions and is likely to use cultural diﬀerences as a tool for

exploitation. That was the case for a Singaporean executive negotiating

with a Swedish counterpart. He intentionally drew out discussions

and withheld clear responses, capitalizing on the discomfort people

from the Swedish culture tend to have with ambiguity. The Swedish

negotiator fell into the trap and started to concede on certain points just

to move things forward.

In another deal we studied, one of the negotiators, perceiving a slight

power advantage, intentionally set tight deadlines and emphasized the

need for quick responses. Her goal was to pressure her Vietnamese

counterpart, recognizing that his preference, typical of his culture, was

for consensual decision-making and conﬂict avoidance. She justiﬁed

her moves by claiming that they were standard procedures in her

culture and that since they were negotiating in her country, the

Vietnamese executive should adapt. Through these power tactics, she

pushed the Vietnamese negotiator into operating outside his comfort

zone, which caused him to make mistakes and bad decisions. He

ultimately ended up making an unfavorable deal.

The best way to gauge your counterpart’s intentions is to make your own explicit, because this typically encourages reciprocal behavior.

No amount of cultural savviness will stop win-lose negotiators from

trying to use power-based moves—such as lies, threats, abuses,

manipulations, and ultimatums—to get what they want, often at the

counterpart’s expense. Win-win negotiators choose collaborative, non-

power-based strategies to reach a favorable deal with their counterparts.

They rely on enhanced communication, trust building, emotional
