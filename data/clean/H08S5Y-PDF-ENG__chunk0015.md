# schedule multiple meetings.

Becoming a leader of leaders is a change of both scope and attitude. Your decisions may now aﬀect dozens (or hundreds) of employees. Your

results depend on how well other experienced professionals do their

jobs, not on what you can personally make happen. Stepping into these

shifts doesn’t happen overnight and it can feel nerve-wracking for a

while. But once you make peace with—and embrace—this new version

of leadership, you’ll unlock new levels of impact and satisfaction you

never imagined.
