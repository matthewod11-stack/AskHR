## HBR / The Big Idea / The Case for Sabbaticals — and How to Take a Successful One

In an eﬀort to encourage more people to pursue sabbaticals — and to

reap the career and life rewards — I have spent the past seven years

studying the ins and outs of successful sabbaticals. Here I’ll answer the

most common questions about them: What distinguishes a sabbatical

from a long vacation? Who takes them and why? What challenges must

be overcome to do so, and how do you ensure a meaningful experience?

(To share your sabbatical experience and be included in my research,

take this survey.)
