of performance problems and given a chance to improve their performance, and ratings from multiple raters are consistent. Interestingly, an analysis of appellate court cases suggests that conservative courts (e.g., th Circuit) are more likely to base their decisions on the validity and accuracy of the performance appraisal instrument, whereas liberal courts (e.g., th Circuit) are more likely to base their decisions on fairness issues (Lee, Havighurst, & Rassel, ).

Although training supervisors to evaluate performance is essential to a sound and legal performance appraisal system, few organizations spend the time and resources necessary to do this properly (Hauenstein, ). This lack of training is surprising given that research has indicated that training supervisors to become aware of the various rating errors and how to avoid them often increases accuracy and reduces rating errors (Hauenstein, ), increases the validity of tests validated against the ratings (Pursell, Dossett, & Latham, ), and increases employee satisfaction with the ratings (Ivancevich, ). This is especially true when the training technique uses discussion, practice in rating, and feedback about rating accuracy rather than lecture (Smith, ). These training effects, however, are short-lived (Noble, ) unless additional training and feedback are provided, and they can even reduce the accuracy of ratings by substituting new errors (Bernardin & Pence, ).

The effectiveness of rater training also is a function of training format. Raters who receive frame-of-reference training make fewer rating errors and recall more training information than do untrained raters or raters receiving information about only job-related behaviors (Athey & McIntyre, ; Day & Sulsky, ; Sulsky & Day, ). Frame-of-reference training provides raters with job-related information, practice in rating, and examples of ratings made by experts as well as the rationale behind those expert ratings (Hauenstein & Foti, ). The goal of frame-of reference training is to communicate the organization’s definition of effective performance and to then get raters to consider only relevant employee behaviors when making performance evaluations (Uggerslev & Sulsky, ).

Though training raters is certainly important, it is also important to explain the performance appraisal system to employees. Not surprisingly, the better that employees understand the performance appraisal system, the greater is their satisfaction with the system (Whiting, Kline, & Sulsky, ).
