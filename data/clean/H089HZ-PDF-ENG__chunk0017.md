# repercussions.

Leaders must publicly recognize these very real ramiﬁcations,

acknowledge how the organization contributed to them with past policy

mean walking away from policies because they’re unpopular, but rather

recognizing that your employees may be facing very real and scary

challenges and considering ways to help solve them.
