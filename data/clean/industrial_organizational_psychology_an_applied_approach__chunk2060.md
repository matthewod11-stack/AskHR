to offer, the supervisor can provide some. A sample conversation might go something like this: Employee: I know I shouldn’t be missing work, but I’m so tired in the morning and often don’t hear the alarm. Supervisor: Can you think of things you can do so that you will not be so tired in the morning? Employee: I could go to bed earlier, but I love to watch David Letterman and then SportsCenter on ESPN. Supervisor: Could you try watching the early edition of SportsCenter and tape the David Letterman show so that you can watch it when you get home from work? Employee: I guess I could give that a try. After arriving at a solution, the supervisor and the employee should then set a specific goal. For example, they could agree that the employee will be on time every day for the next week.
