## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Reimagine Scale

experimentation process that led to Rent the Runway, but because this

business has inherent limits to scale tied to renting physical assets,

some have pushed back on the example because “it didn’t really scale.”

While we all understand the motivation for these questions, somehow,

these critiques also feel slightly misplaced. But can we say it out

loud? Can we say why getting bigger does not always equal success?

Others have done so, including famed economist E.F. Schumacher in

his book, Small Is Beautiful. There is a ﬂaw at the heart of the concept

of scaling, though it can be hard to articulate in the face of “bigger is

better.” Looking back to the roots of “scale” can help us pinpoint what

conventional wisdom might be missing.
