## Predicting Performance Using Applicant Training and Education

For many jobs, it is common that applicants must have a minimum level of educa- tion or training to be considered. That is, an organization might require that man- agerial applicants have a bachelor’s degree to pass the initial applicant screening process. Though degree requirements may seem logical, the research literature has found inconsistent results regarding their validity. A meta-analysis by Hunter and Hunter () found that the validity of education was only . and that it did not add any predictive power (incremental validity) over the use of cognitive ability tests. However, a meta-analysis of the relationship between education and police performance found that education was a valid predictor of performance in the police academy (r = ., ρ = .) and performance on the job (r = ., ρ = .) and added incremental validity to cognitive ability tests (Aamodt, ).

Meta-analyses indicate that a student’s GPA can predict job performance (Roth, BeVier, Switzer, & Schippmann, ), training performance (Dye & Reck, ), promotions (Cohen, ), salary (Roth & Clarke, ), and graduate

school performance (Kuncel, Hezlett, & Ones, ). GPA is most predictive in the first few years after graduation (Roth et al., ). As with many measures of cognitive ability, the use of GPA will result in high levels of adverse impact (Roth & Bobko, ). Another factor complicating the use of education and GPA to select employees is the increased use of homeschooling; more than  mil- lion children are currently being homeschooled in the United States (Beato, ).
