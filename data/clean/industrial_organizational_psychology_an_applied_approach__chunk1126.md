## Predicting Performance Using Applicant Knowledge

Used primarily in the public sector, especially for promotions, job knowledge tests are designed to measure how much a person knows about a job. For exam- ple, applicants for a bartender position might be asked how to make a martini or a White Russian, and applicants for an HR position might be asked how to conduct a job analysis. These tests are similar to the exams given several times a semester in a college class. They are typically given in multiple-choice fashion for ease of scoring, but they also can be written in essay format or given orally in a job interview. Common examples of job knowledge tests include tests of computer programming knowledge, knowledge of electronics, and knowledge of mechanical principles. Standardized job knowledge tests are commonly used by state licensing boards for such occupations as lawyers and psychologists.

Job knowledge tests have excellent content and criterion validity (Schmidt & Hunter, ), and because of their high face validity, they are positively accepted by applicants (Robertson & Kandola, ). Even though job knowledge tests do a good job of predicting performance, they often result in adverse impact and can be used only for jobs in which applicants are expected to have job knowledge at the time of hire or promotion.
