# Implications for practice

Learning is leveraging advances in technology and social media.

How do the characteristics of various technologies used for learning delivery and instruction influence what is learned, the time spent learning, learning difficulty, and transfer of training? What are the mechanisms through which simulations, games, and social media contribute to learning? How should social media tools be designed to maximize learning? What learning outcomes are influenced by social media?

Theuseof onlineandmobiletechnology for learning delivery and instruction can reduce training costs for geographically dispersed employees. However, to realize benefits, designers and managers must focus on how to maximize learning and transfer of training considering the learning objectives.

Prelearning interventions and design elements can facilitate learning and transfer of training.

What are the appropriate timing and intensity of transfer of training interventions? How does the structure of after action reviews (AARs) influence their effectiveness, especially with respect to knowledge acquisition?

Organizations shouldadoptprelearning interventions and AARs to facilitate learning and transfer of training.

Learning through gaming and simulation can be done on- or off line, with single or multiple players(Castranova 2005, Malaby 2006). It deeply engages the learner while providing a fun and stimulating way to learn from meaningful scenarios that approximate reality (Kriz 2009). Recent taxonomies of game attributes can help researchers investigate the characteristics of effective gaming and simulations. Wilson et al. (2008) proposed varying relationships between game attributes (adaptation; assessment; challenge; conflict; control; fantasy; equipment, interpersonal, or social interaction; language/communication; location; mystery; pieces or players; progress and surprise; representation; rules/goals; safety; sensory stimuli) and learning outcomes (cognitive, skill-based, or affective learning). Based on the judgments of subject matter experts who were serious gamers, Bedwell et al. (2012) developed a more parsimonious taxonomy of gaming attributes including action language, assessment, conflict/challenge, control, environment, game fiction, human interaction, immersion, and rules/goals.

In a meta-analysis of computer-based simulation games, Sitzmann (2011) found that learnersâ€™ self-efficacy and knowledge were higher for those trained using simulation games compared with those trained using other methods. Simulation games were most effective when the learners were actively engaged with the content, they could access the simulation as many times as they wanted, and the simulation was supplemental rather than the primary instruction method.

Social media, including Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, has merged online context with a social element, providing a potential catalyst for learning through opportunities to network, meetnewpeople, andinteractwithconsumers. Individualswhohavegrownupinthesocialmedia revolution may actually learn in a different way than do those from previous generations (Dabbagh & Kitsantas 2012). The heightened interest in how learning can occur through social media has been augmented by the increased availability of smartphones and tablet computers. Lewis et al. (2010) argue that it is not just faster technology, offering continuously accessible social
