# Planning for Stress

Some of the techniques that are suggested to proactively reduce stress should also be considered during times you are actually engaged in stress. These are dis- cussed in the following sections.

Exercise Exercising not only keeps your heart strong and resistant to the effects of stress, but can also help reduce your stress levels during particular stressful moments. It is a good idea to incorporate some kind of exercise program into your life at least three or four times a week for  minutes. You can reap great benefits from walking, swimming, running, playing sports, or climbing stairs because these strengthen your cardiovascular system, thereby making you more resistant to the effects of stress. Even such household chores as mowing the lawn, vacuuming, or washing your car can help your cardiovascular system. The good news is that not all exercise has to be strenuous. Certain good prestress relaxation techniques (explained later in this section) can be used during and after stress.

To begin an exercise program, start with “baby steps.” For instance, instead of taking the elevator at work or school, walk up the stairs. Or consider this: Stop driving around the mall parking lot  times looking for the perfect parking spot! Instead, make a conscious effort to park farther away and walk the distance. From these baby steps, make the transition into a more serious exercise routine. Just remember to pick a program that works for you, which might not be the one your friends use. If you don’t like running, don’t do it. There is no need to add to your stress by choosing exercises that you absolutely can’t tolerate. As a good example, many of my graduate students lift weights to reduce stress. They have repeatedly asked me to join them, but I decline because I know that their plan of “We’re going to work on abs for an hour this morning and then shoulders for an hour this evening” involves more time than is practical for my Type A personal- ity. Instead, I stick to the trusty Bullworker I purchased in the s (they actually still make the Bullworker—an isometric piece of exercise equipment).

Organizations realize how important exercise is to managing the effects of stress, as evidenced by the increase in worksite fitness and health programs over the last  years. Research shows that exercise can reduce coronary heart disease by reducing blood pressure and lowering cholesterol (Gebhardt & Crump, ). In addition, meta-analysis results indicate that employee wellness programs, which often include exercise, result in lower levels of absenteeism and perhaps higher levels of performance (DeGroot & Kiker, ).

A good example of the effectiveness of wellness programs can be found at the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in Catawba County, North Carolina. Prior to initiation of its wellness program, the EMS was losing an average of two para- medics a year to work-related injuries. To increase wellness, the EMS conducted medical screenings and offered memberships to a local gym. After one year, absenteeism dropped from an average of  hours per employee to  hours; two employees quit smoking; and % of the employees lost body fat (Bradley, ).

Laughter Humor has been shown to buffer stress in several ways (Chubb, ; Singer, ). First, it can help you put a new perspective on a stressful situation. You have probably heard many jokes about death—many of which are told by police officers, doctors, and morticians! The purpose of such jokes is not to hurt feelings or show

callousness but to better deal with an uncomfortable topic that we all must face sooner or later. It is better to laugh at it than to dwell over what we can’t control. But be careful when telling such jokes: Not everyone will appreciate the humor, and a little sensitivity and common sense should be exercised before sharing it.

Second, when you are upset and in what seems to be a difficult situation, going to a funny movie, listening to a comedian, or watching a funny television show can help distance you from the situation until you have calmed down enough to begin thinking rationally again.

Physically, laughter can reduce your blood pressure. Studies show that laugh- ing through a funny movie has the same effect on your heart as  minutes on a rowing machine (Stanten, ). So next time you have the opportunity to go to a funny movie, go! Or, if you have a favorite comedy show that comes on more than once a week, try to watch as many episodes as possible (but don’t forget to study for this class).

Though much has been written about the potential stress reduction bene- fits of humor, a qualitative literature review by Martin () suggests that more research is needed to determine whether humor is as useful as thought to be. Martin’s review does not conclude that humor is not useful, but instead con- cludes that the jury is still out.

Diet Foods that have been shown to counteract the effects of stress include fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nonfat yogurt, which contains the B vitamin considered to be lost during high-stress periods of time (Ornish, ). A daily dose of one or more of these can help you meet stress head on! Also, decrease your intake of fat, because your body has to work overtime to digest fatty foods, adding to your level of stress (Carpi, ). To help reduce the effects of stress, many organizations are including healthier items in their vending machines.

Drinking water helps keep your body hydrated and able to cope with daily stressors (maybe all that running to the bathroom is an added bonus to reducing

stress and keeping you fit!). Caffeine should be gradually eliminated from your diet altogether. But before your stress level elevates from thinking about going without your daily caffeine boost, notice I said “should be” eliminated. If you can’t eliminate caffeine, at least reduce your daily intake. Any change in that area is better than none. Be aware of just how much caffeine you are getting: You may be getting more than you think. It’s not just cola and coffee products that contain caffeine; chocolate and many types of medicines and other foods have caffeine as well. If you decide to eliminate caffeine from your diet, do it gradually. Most people who are used to large amounts of daily caffeine experience withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, severe headaches, and fatigue if they go “cold turkey.”

Smoking Reduction Though many smokers say smoking decreases their feelings of stress, research indicates that smoking increases the physiological characteristics associated with stress (Kassel, Stroud, & Paronis, ). This is an important finding because research also indicates that smokers increase their smoking when they feel stressed (McCann & Lester, ). Thus, smoking and stress become a vicious cycle in which people smoke because they are stressed and then become more stressed because they smoke.

Sleep There is no one study that says absolutely just how much individuals need to sleep. What studies show is that sleep deprivation or lack of sleep can cause nega- tive behavior such as irritability, fatigue, lack of concentration, and even depres- sion. Alcohol can severely affect your sleep, although it may seem that it helps you go to sleep. Studies show that the sleep of people who have had as little as two drinks before bed is interrupted several times a night. In addition, stay away from caffeine at least six hours before going to bed.
