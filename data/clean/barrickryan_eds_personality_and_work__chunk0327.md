# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 103

A third component of motivation that can be inﬂuenced by personality is psychological motives. Motive-based theories focus on the inﬂuence on behavior of one or more psychological mo- tives (for example, altruism, personal development, competence), recognizing that people may have very different purposes for ex- hibiting the same behavior (Borman & Penner, 2001). The types of motives that are likely to be inﬂuenced by personality are val- ues, interests, preferences (Dawis, 1991), and attitudes (Penner, Midili, & Kegelmeyer, 1997). Motives are expected to inﬂuence proactive cognitive processes directly (Kanfer, 1992). The follow- ing sections review how personality has been shown to be related to each component of motivation.
