## Two types of cased brought before the courts, disparate treatment and disparate

impact. Disparate treatment is when an agent of employer knowingly is treating person( s)

employed differently based on one or more of the prohibited factors. For instance refusing

to hire women for construction jobs, is knowingly treating women different from men,

therefore this is sex discrimination (Frierson, 1994). McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green

was a landmark case which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiff in a disparate

treatment case must prove four elements one, plaintiff belonged to a protective class two,

was qualified for the job involved t1'.Jee, ,vas treated L.~ &~ adverse way ( de:firied as not

hired, promoted, or discharged) and four, was treated differently from members of another

41

class (Frierson, 1994). If these elements can be proven, then the defendant-business must

be able to present a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, business reason for its conduct.

Conversely, the plaintiff can still prevail if he or she can demonstrate the reason given by

the defendant was merely a pretext for discrimination and not the real reason behind the

employers' actions. Disparate impact, is simply accidental discrimination, consequently it

is still illegal. For instance, an employer hiring unskilled workers, which require

employees to have a record free from criminal arrest, will violate this law based on two

elements. The first element is this rule has a different affect on one covered group as

compared to another. Once you factor in statistical data and geographic locations of the

company and where they hire, this will dramatically affect the equation and the result.

Second element, a business rule did not rest on a valid job requirement otherwise know as

a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ). In such cases the courts can award to the

plaintiff back pay, order hiring, promotions or other equitable remedies and assess the
