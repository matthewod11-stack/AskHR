## volunteer work — just as they would a traditional work experience.

Employers are launching career reentry programs at unprecedented

rates. Recruiters are recognizing that people who’ve temporarily left the

workforce are a “hidden” talent pool — and that in most cases, their

decision to take a break from paid work has nothing to do with job

career re-entry programs require that applicants have a minimum of a

one-to-two-year career break to be eligible. However, many job seekers
