and promised its workforce of 275,000 that all employees who agreed

to undergo it, even those whose roles were eliminated by automation,

would have a job with the company, though it might not be the same job.

Internal job markets help current employees move to new positions in

their organizations where the growth is and where they can learn new

skills. They not only cost very little but also save enormous amounts

of money by reducing turnover and the need to hire from the outside.

Though internal job markets date back to the dot-com days of 1995 to

2000, they were scaled down after the Great Recession under pressure

from line managers who didn’t want to let their good employees leave

them, even if it was for better jobs in the same organization. Now these

programs are being revived, often under the name “talent marketplace.”

HSBC says its talent marketplace was critical to its transformation into a

digital-ﬁrst bank. Unilever’s former CEO Alan Jope praised its revamped

internal job market, Flex Experiences, for helping the company

rearrange talent in a way that allowed it to weather the pandemic

and become more agile. A few years ago Flex expanded into matching

employees with learning opportunities on projects, particularly those

with ESG objectives. Since 2018 Unilever has reallocated 500,000

employee hours toward more than 4,000 business-critical projects,

improving overall productivity by 41% in the process. Seventy percent

of the assignments in those projects were cross-functional, helping

employees build skills that will make the organization even more agile.
