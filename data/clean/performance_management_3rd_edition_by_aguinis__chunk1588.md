system in place, you have all necessary steps in place. However, consulting with HR is a good idea to ensure you are following all appropriate steps.

Avoiding the above pitfalls will minimize the possibility of problems during the formal disciplinary process. If the goals are not reached, there will be a need for a termination meeting. This meeting is of course extremely unpleasant for all involved, to say the least. However, it is the right and fair thing to do at this stage. Suggestions for the termi- nation meeting are as follows:44

- 1. Be respectful.

It is important to treat the terminated employee with respect and dignity. Keep the information about the termination confidential, although it is likely others will learn about it in subsequent days.

- 2. Get right to the point. At this stage, the less said, the better. Summarize the per- formance problems, actions taken to try to overcome these problems, outcomes of these actions, and the decision about termination that you have reached.

- 3. Wish the employee well. The purpose of the meeting is not to rehash every single reason why you are letting the employee go and every single instance of poor performance. Instead, use the meeting to wish the person well in her next job and endeavors, and tell her that she will be missed.

- 4. Send the employee to HR. Let the employee know that he needs to go to HR to receive information on benefits, including vacation pay, and to receive informa- tion on legal rights. If you are working in a small business, seek outside legal counsel regarding the information to give to the terminated employee.

- 5. Have the employee leave immediately. Keeping the terminated employee on-site can lead to gossip and conflict, and disgruntled employees may engage in sabotage. It is better to conduct the termina- tion meeting at the end of the day so that the employee can leave the office as everyone else when there are fewer people around.

- 6. Have the termination meeting at the end of the day.

The aforementioned information regarding the disciplinary process and termina- tion may be used as a follow-up to a formal performance review meeting held because of a lack of remedial action on the part of the employee. So, let’s discuss performance review meetings next, which may or may not lead to the disciplinary process and termination we just discussed.
