 Provide workers with a safe space to voice their concerns.

 Benchmark key aspects of your organization’s culture—and understand the employee

experience—before making changes to promote inclusivity.

 Remember that daily interactions are the most telling sign of whether or not your

company has an inclusive culture.

According to Cox and Lancefield (2021), ‘There’s widespread agreement on the need to

improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace. But it’s not easy to deliver on the promises

made. It’s time to adopt a more systematic, coherent approach. By following these five

strategies, leaders can make more progress and create a more representative, fair, and high-

performing workforce’.
