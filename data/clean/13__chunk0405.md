# yi ¼ bXi þ Zici þ (cid:1)i

(11)

where yi is a 1 (cid:1) ni vector of outcomes (i.e., job performance) for individual i, Xi is a b (cid:1) ni matrix of ﬁxed effects, Zi is a g (cid:1) ni matrix for the random effects, gi is a 1 (cid:1) g vector of random effects, and b is a 1 (cid:1) b vector of ﬁxed effects parameters. Residuals between any two individuals are assumed to be uncorrelated, but residuals within an individual have a particular covariance structure. The ﬁxed effects component (b) are constant across (Zi) are different across individuals; individuals, hence the indexing subscript i. The random effects (gi) are assumed to be distributed independently across individuals, with the following distribution:
