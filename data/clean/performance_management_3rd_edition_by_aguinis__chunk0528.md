## Part I â€¢ Strategic and General Considerations

The human resources (HR) function plays a critical role in creating and implementing the strategies that will allow the organization to realize its mission and vision. Specifically, the HR function can make the following contributions:

- Communicate knowledge of strategic plan. The HR function can be a good conduit to communicate the various components of the strategic plan (e.g., mission, vision, and goals) to all the employees.

- Outline knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed for strategy implementation. The HR function, through job analyses and the resulting job descriptions, serves as a repository of knowledge regarding what KSAs are needed for a successful imple- mentation of the strategic plan. Thus, the HR function is in a unique situation to provide information about whether the current workforce has the KSAs needed to support the strategic plan and, if not, to offer suggestions about what types of employees should be hired and what types of plans should be put in place to develop the needed KSAs internally.

- Propose reward systems. The HR function can provide useful information on what type of reward system should be implemented to motivate employees to support the strategic plan.
