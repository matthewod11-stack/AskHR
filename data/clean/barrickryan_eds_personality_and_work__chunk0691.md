# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 235

nity frame of reference generally led to higher self-efﬁcacy going into the program and ultimately to better learning. Quiñones (1995) examined different effects of framing training program assign- ments on learning outcomes. Assignments to a training program were described as remedial or advanced. Results indicated that the framing had an impact on attributions for past performance as well as fairness perceptions, motivation to learn, and learning out- comes. Quiñones notes that context really does matter and advo- cates designing interventions focusing on contextual factors that increase motivation to learn across participants rather than neces- sarily tailoring motivational interventions to individual trainees. Very few studies have investigated the effects of various types of strong situational presses prior to or during the training experi- ence itself.
