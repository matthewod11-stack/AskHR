# 03 Compensation and motivation

Compensation has a significant impact on employees’ motivation and job satisfaction. When pay is below market standards or does not clearly reflect an employee’s contributions, it can lead to feelings of underappreciation and disengagement. Ambiguous compensation plans, such as unclear performance incentives or overly complex bonus structures, can further discourage employees, eroding motivation. Employees who feel their compensation does not match their efforts are often less productive and may seek opportunities elsewhere, which can lead to higher turnover and costly rehiring.
