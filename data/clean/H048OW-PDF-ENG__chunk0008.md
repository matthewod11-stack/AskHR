## whether the cultural values that CEOs inherit from their parents and

grandparents affect their decision-making and their ﬁrms’ performance.

Our sample consisted of 610 U.S. bank CEOs who were born in the U.S.,

which we separated into three groups: those whose parents were

immigrants to the U.S., those whose grandparents were immigrants to the

U.S., and those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.

(our control group). We chose this design as a way to isolate the effect of

cultural heritage: while CEOs born to immigrant parents or grandparents

are exposed to the same legal, social, and institutional inﬂuences as other

CEOs, they’re likely to possess a distinct cultural heritage. Research has

long shown that cultural values are deeply rooted and that immigrants to

the U.S. show a degree of cultural distinctness over several generations.

the role of women in society have been found to parallel those found in the
