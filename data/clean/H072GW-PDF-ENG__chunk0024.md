## HBR / Digital Article / An Intersectional Approach to Inclusion at Work

Not only is this suboptimal for any analyst because data analysis

requires deep work, but it would be a major barrier for autistic people,

who pay a higher psychological price for distraction. Many autistic

professionals have lost their jobs because their responsibilities were

changed to include excessive multitasking, they were moved into noisy

areas, or they were otherwise precluded from exercising their strengths

— without their input. It’s more eﬀective to involve individuals in

crafting their jobs than attempting to design for them, even if using

empathy. Empathy is constrained by similarity, and those who have

not experienced autistic focus may think of an interruption as a minor

inconvenience, not the sensation of being hit with a baseball bat.
