# necessary due to a qualifying exigency.

When the need for leave is foreseeable, an employee must give the employer at least 30 days notice, or as much notice as is practicable. When the leave is not foreseeable, the employee must provide notice as soon as

practicable in the particular circumstances. An employee must comply with the employer's usual and

customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances. In

requesting leave an employee need not speciﬁcally reference the FMLA but must provide suﬃcient information

for the employer to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request. By contrast, when the employee seeks leave for a qualifying reason for which the employer has previously provided the employee

FMLA-protected leave, the employee must speciﬁcally reference the qualifying reason for the leave or the need

for FMLA leave.

An employer may require that a serious health condition, or a serious illness or injury of a covered

servicemember, be supported by a certiﬁcation from the employee's health care provider, the employee's family member's health care provider, or an authorized health care provider of the covered servicemember. An

employer may also require periodic reports of the employee's status and intent to return to work during the

leave. Additionally, under certain conditions, an employer may require that an employee who takes FMLA leave

for his or her own serious health condition submit a "ﬁtness for duty" certiﬁcation from the employee's health

care provider that the employee is able to return to work.

An employee who returns from FMLA leave is entitled to be restored to the same or an equivalent job with

equivalent pay, beneﬁts, and other terms and conditions of employment. The employee may, but is not entitled

to, accrue additional beneﬁts during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. However, the employer must return him or

her to employment with the same beneﬁts at the same levels as existed when leave began.
