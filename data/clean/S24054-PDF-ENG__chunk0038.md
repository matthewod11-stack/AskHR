## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

been part of such a system, I have a strong sense of humility about my

—or any individual player’s—ability to inﬂuence team performance. As

the Patriots’ quarterback and captain, I could have perfectly carried out

every one of the seven behaviors I just described, but without the other

elements of our system, we might have had far less success.

It can be hard for individual team leaders to inﬂuence change across

large organizations. A pro football team has 53 players, 20 or so coaches,

and 20 or so key support staﬀ, so call it about 100 people. One or two

peer leaders can have an inﬂuence on a group that size. Compare that

with Delta Air Lines, where I’m now a strategic adviser. It has 100,000

employees. Delta is a great company, and many of its employees feel

a sense of ownership and pride. But creating a culture where people

care about one another in a company that big is challenging. Assessing individual performance can be more diﬃcult too.

A leader’s style and inﬂuence will take time to evolve. It can take years

for a leader’s style to become natural and eﬀective. During my ﬁrst

season in the NFL, I was a third-string quarterback. No one outside the

Patriots thought of me as a team leader. But inside the locker room, I

was showing leadership in small ways. For example, I regularly pulled

younger guys aside after practice to run extra plays. “The starters are

playing more than we are, so we need to do more to keep up and to

get better,” I’d tell them. Within my small group—the oﬀensive players

who weren’t starters—I was taking charge. I also focused on showing

conﬁdence so that more-experienced teammates would trust me when

I began playing in games. By the time I was in my 40s, I was leading in

a much diﬀerent style. Some younger players who’d grown up watching

me on TV felt intimidated by me, so I worked on being approachable

and showing humility. And by that point, I didn’t have to try to appear

conﬁdent because I had developed real conﬁdence.
