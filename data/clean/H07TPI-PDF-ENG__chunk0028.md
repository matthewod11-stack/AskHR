## A systems-level perspective draws attention to the fact that the

interactions and connections between people in organizations are

diverse and complex. As my research demonstrates, when policies

reverberate, they can harm groups or subgroups in ways that are

entirely unanticipated by organizational leaders and policy designers.

For instance, well-intentioned “ban the box” initiatives aimed at

preventing discrimination against people with criminal records — and

adopted by many companies and mandated in over a hundred states,

cities, and counties in the United States — have also been found to

in some cases increase racial discrimination against Black applicants,

because when these policies are in place, it seems employers are more

likely to incorrectly presume Black applicants have a criminal past.
