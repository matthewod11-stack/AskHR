2.1 SHG performance SHGs are formed with the objective of eradication of poverty in the society through the empowerment of women. This is so much so as a country the women should be brought to the forefront Performance of the SHGs are closely connected to the alleviation of poverty and improvement of financial and social status. Therefore it is very important that the SHG performance be measured comprehensively. Unfortunately, most of the studies held are focused on the financial parameters and leave the organizational and social parameters which leads to narrow and incomplete assessment of the group performance.

In a study conducted by (S.C Bharamappanavara etal., 2015), it is concluded that Organizational and soci o economic factors influences the SHG performance. Study concluded that there is positive correlation between overall group performance and organizational parameters like attendance, transparency, trust,decision making with consensus etc.

2.2 Demographic variables and group performance Manimekalai and Rajeshwari (2001)showed in their studies that SHGs have improved their performance when they were provided loans and the groups have also developed belongingness and attained skills which lead to increased performance.

In a study conducted in Karnataka (Nagaraj, N; et al, 2009) it is inferred that education plays an important role in group performance. But here the case is such that the area of study is conducted in Hatenhalli which has a literacy rate of only 21%.In our study the ar ea under study has a literacy rate of more than 95% and hence the validity of the result may not be significant.

In a study conducted in Bihar(Meena et al.,2011) there is a positivecorrelation between education and training to the attitude of group members.Education and training seem to have lead to an increased performance of SHGs.
