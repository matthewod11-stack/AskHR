The scope and present status of the science [Industrial Psychol- ogy], the rapidity of its development, can only be fully under- stood by considering economic, social, and psychological factors which have contributed to this development. (Viteles, 1932, p. 5)

While studying great discoveries and individuals in the his- tory of industrial-organizational (I-O) psychology in the past several years, I found myself frequently asking, “Why were psychologists studying behavior in work settings and apply- ing psychology to improve the workplace?” To answer this question, I realized that the evolution of I-O psychology must be examined within the overall social, cultural, and political contexts of the times, an approach referred to as a new his- tory of psychology (Furumoto, 1988). Pate and Wertheimer (1993), for example, stated, “The history of a discipline such as psychology involves describing major discoveries, illumi- nating questions of priority, and identifying ‘great individu- als’ in the context of a national or international Zeitgeist” (p. xv). This chapter is a nascent effort to describe the zeit- geist or social-historical context of I-O psychology by identi- fying various dynamic forces that shaped the rise of the discipline during the past 100 years in the United States.
