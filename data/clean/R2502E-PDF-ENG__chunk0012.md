Our research has shown that women aren’t earning the same amount

of experience capital as men. There are multiple systemic issues at

work here that need to be addressed if we want to solve this problem,

including biases in hiring and promotion, but in the meantime there’s

plenty that women can do to help themselves. That’s what this article

is about: the actions that women can take. By distilling what we’ve

learned in more than a decade of research and through interviews

with successful female leaders, we’ve developed a set of strategies and

practices for developing experience capital that can help women set

themselves up for success—in a way that will beneﬁt not just them but

also the people and companies they work with.
