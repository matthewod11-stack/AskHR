## the program, and which stakeholders (vendors, suppliers, partners, etc.)

will be held to these same standards.

Why does this matter? Because how you roll out your program across

multiple markets informs what enterprise-wide procedures and metrics

you choose down the line. If, for example, you decide to roll out the

program consistently across all markets, then you can have a consistent

set of procedures and metrics across those markets. If, on the other hand, the program is diﬀerent depending on the market (e.g., in the way

you uphold GDPR in the European Union but not in the United States), then diﬀerent procedures and metrics of success are appropriate.
