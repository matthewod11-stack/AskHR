# Deciding What to Delegate

Before you can successfully delegate, you need to learn to diﬀerentiate

between the work you should keep—and, indeed, do more of—and the

work that is better left to a team member. My advice is simple: When

considering any meeting, task, or responsibility, always ask yourself,

“Am I the best and cheapest person to get this done?” If the answer is no,

delegate the work and give the person you’re handing it to the context

needed to succeed.

Context-setting includes explaining why the work needs to be

done (following an organizational strategy, entering a new market,

onboarding a client, or investing in a project, for example); the results

the person or group is expected to deliver; the deadline for the work;
