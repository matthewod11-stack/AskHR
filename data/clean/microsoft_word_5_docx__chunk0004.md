# Abstract

In the last few years, we have experienced a global economic crisis, but also a crisis in the social world and in the sports world. During the past decade, sports management directed an institution focused on competitive sports, and characterized by ignorance of the educational level of the staff, limited training and lack of continuing education for the trainers, and under-utilization of human resources. An analysis of the role of leader in sports management will permit the study of ways to improve the organization with the resources at hand. The leader has taken responsibility for a change in the cooperative relationship in the institution as evidenced by a closer relationship among all the personal, employeesâ€™ confidence in important decisions made by the leader, and customer loyalty.
