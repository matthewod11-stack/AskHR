ratings for predictor and criterion variables will help address this problem, and longitudinal designs will help clarify problems with ambiguous causality. Importantly, both problems can be addressed by well-designed literature laboratory research, which is underutilized in the humor (see Martin, 2001, and Ziv, 1988 for exceptions).

An examination of humor and culture in organizations also raises a number of applied issues that could bear on the utility of humor use in organizations. Some of these were raised by Malone (1980) and Duncan (1982), and have gone largely unanswered in the last two decades. For example, Malone questioned whether humor can be used effectively as a managerial tool, and if so, can it be used by just anybody? That is, can an ability to produce humor in socially appropriate contexts be learned, or is it dependent on humor-related traits? Similarly, one might ask how important humor appreciation is as a component of humor’s ability to inﬂuence organizationally relevant outcomes.
