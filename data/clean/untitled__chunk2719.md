# PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE

How does one integrate equally successfully into both cul- tures, the mainstream majority culture (Anglo-Saxon) and the mainstream minority culture (ethnic-minority)? It has always been my intent to have an impact in the ﬁeld of psy- chology as a neuropsychologist who was Cuban. For the ﬁrst 15 years of my career, I published exclusively on noncultural issues, primarily biopsychosocial variables in neuropsycho- logical assessment.

All the while, I have held positions in APA governance (e.g., two terms on Council of Representatives) and have been mentored by Richard Suinn, past-president of APA. In these positions, I have both self-identiﬁed and been identiﬁed as an ethnic-minority. Though I value this work, I often see myself as an outsider both within these ethnic- minority groups as well as with “majority” groups whose interests have little, if anything, to do with ethnic-minority concerns.

Perhaps both groups, majority and minority, can consider their mission the development of a psychology of variance (Puente et al., 1993) rather than a psychology of central tendencies. I believe that would make a more interesting, and truer representation of the history of psychology.
