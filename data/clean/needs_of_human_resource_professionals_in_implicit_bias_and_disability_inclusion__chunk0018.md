RESULTS: Researchers identified four major themes regarding guidelines for training development: 1) educational information on implicit and explicit bias, 2) disability inclusion information and strategies, 3) consideration of multiple learning modalities, and 4) case studies.

CONCLUSION: Training interventions incorporating these needs and preferences of HR professionals may more effectively increase awareness of implicit bias in the workplace. Sharing evidence regarding implicit and explicit bias, along with current information on disability inclusion, while using varied instructional strategies may lead to a reduction in disability-related stigma and discrimination in the workplace.
