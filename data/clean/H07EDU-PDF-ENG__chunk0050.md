## HBR / Digital Article / What Companies Still Get Wrong About Layoffs

We treated your colleagues well. We have a credible strategy to improve

the company’s prospects. There is a clear role for you to play in the

future success of the company. People trust in actions, not words, so the

real test will be making sure that each of these statements syncs with

things you have done and will keep doing.

Be prepared to publicly apologize.

In the past, corporate leadership refrained from making public

apologies for reducing staﬀ. Today, in contrast, the trend is for CEOs

to apologize for eliminating jobs.

How you apologize matters. When making a company apology,

researchers have identiﬁed three essential elements for restoring lost

trust: 1) Acknowledge harm and say you are sorry for it; 2) explain why

you acted as you did; and 3) make an oﬀer of repair that genuinely helps

the person you harmed. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison’s recent email to

employees in which he announced a 14% reduction of staﬀ succinctly

communicates an eﬀective apology. Collison’s tone conveyed sincerity

in acknowledging mistakes: “We’re very sorry to be taking this step and

John and I are fully responsible … We overhired for the world we’re in.”

It’s hard for leaders to make this type of public apology without inviting

cynicism, and today, social media and online news archives make it

easy for anyone to ﬁnd contradictions in a CEO’s message.

. . .

Successfully managing workforce changes within today’s landscape

ultimately requires evaluating your actions against the backdrop of

trust. Your company will weather the storm of layoﬀs more successfully

if you can maintain trust with three groups who will determine your

success in the future: employees you let go, employees you retain, and

employees who don’t yet work for you.
