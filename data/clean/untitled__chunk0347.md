# STRUGGLES FOR PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY

As early as 1915, consulting psychologists had petitioned the APA to recognize the growth of applied psychology by com- mitting some program time at the annual meeting for discus- sion of professional issues. But APA leadership had balked, citing the APA’s sole stated objective as an organization that existed for the advancement of psychology as a science.

When the American Association of Clinical Psychologists (AACP) had been founded in 1917, there was concern within the APA that the group would lead to a rupture in organized psychology. In negotiations between the two groups, the AACP agreed to dissolve in 1919 and reorganize as the Clini- cal Section of the APA. The Clinical Section identiﬁed three goals: “promoting better working relationships within clinical and within allied ﬁelds, developing professional standards for practitioners, and encouraging research and publication on topics in clinical psychology” (Napoli, 1981, p. 26).

Two years later, in 1921, the APA created a second section onconsultingpsychology,andtheshort-livedcertiﬁcationpro- gramwouldstemfromtheeffortsofthisgroup.Theconsulting/ clinical psychologists recommended two additional APA sec- tions, one on educational psychology and the other on indus- trial psychology, but those two requests were denied.

As the professional opportunities for psychologists grew and as problems in professional practice occurred, these psy- chologists made additional requests of the APA. They called on the APA to develop a code of professional ethics. They soughthelpinprotectingthelabel“psychologist.”Theycalled for changes in graduate training that included additional ap- plied psychology experiences, including internships (which had begun as early as 1908 but were still uncommon, see Routh, 2000). And, they asked that psychology departments hire more faculty who had signiﬁcant practical experience. Except for some minimal gestures toward the applied group, theAPAlargelyignoredthoserequeststhatwereimportantfor the professionalization of psychology, reminding the group of its mantra that theAPAwas a scientiﬁc association.

Throughout the 1920s, more than a dozen applied psy- chology groups were formed, most of them state associations. The largest of those was the New York State Association of Consulting Psychologists, which had begun in 1921. By 1930, it was clear to the professional psychologists that the

APA was not going to support their efforts. In that year New York University psychologist Douglas Fryer led a reorgani- zation of the New York group, renamed it the Association of Consulting Psychologists (ACP), and extended its geograph- ical boundaries for membership to include the entire United States. TheACP, thus, became the ﬁrst “national” association for professional psychologists. In 1933, theACPpublished its code of professional ethics, the ﬁrst such document for psy- chologists. And, in 1937, it began publication of the Journal of Consulting Psychology, arguably the ﬁrst professional psychology journal.

ACP struggled to establish itself as the national associa- tion for professional psychologists; however, it was dominated by New York psychologists. In 1935, a plan was initiated to broaden the ACP membership by creating a federation of so- cieties. All the existing state associations were invited to join as well as the Clinical Section of the APA. Eventually the fed- eration plan was abandoned, and it was decided to create a wholly new organization, the American Association for Applied Psychology (AAAP), which began in 1938. The ACP and the Clinical Section of the APA both disbanded and became part of AAAP. The ACPjournal was continued by the AAAP—as its ofﬁcial organ.

The AAAP began with four sections: clinical, consulting, educational, and industrial psychology. Fryer served as the ﬁrst president of AAAP and was followed in later years by such important applied psychologists as Walter Van Dyke Bingham (1880–1952) and Carl Rogers (1902–1987). The AAAP’s success was manifested largely through its sections in which psychologists with similar needs could work to- gether on issues of common concern. Each section wrote its own by-laws, elected its own ofﬁcers, created its own com- mittees, and planned its own program at the annual meeting of the AAAP.

Even though most of the AAAP members retained their mem- berships in the older APA, many identiﬁed more strongly with the new organization than with APAbecause AAAPprovided the professional identity, the collegial relations, and the professional assistance that APA had been unwilling to offer. (Benjamin, 1997, p. 728)

Although the AAAP was quite successful in serving the needs of professional psychologists, the organization lasted only slightly more than seven years. Its demise had nothing to do with the service it was providing for the growing profes- sion of psychology. With the United States at war in 1942, there was federal government pressure on the various psychological organizations to come together with one voice for the national good. Negotiations among several groups (including the Society for the Psychological Study of Social
