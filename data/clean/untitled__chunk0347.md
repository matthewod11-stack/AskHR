The new APA also had a new statement of objectives which read: “to advance psychology as a science, as a profession, and as a means of promoting human welfare” (Wolﬂe, 1946/1997, p. 721). The “professional” goal had come, of course, from the AAAP, and the “human welfare” goal from the SPSSI. The APA looked and sounded like a new kind of organization, one that had ﬁnally acknowledged the presence of the profession of psychology. However, professional psy- chologists would soon learn that they had little real support (or power) within the new association. It would be almost 30 years before that situation changed in any dramatic way.
