# meetings.

After receiving feedback, the CEO started to make a point of asking

himself how his team was feeling before he stepped into a meeting

to share his perspective with them. He got better at acknowledging

the team’s concerns, needs, and successes—not just challenging them. As a result, the team felt like he understood the diﬃculties they were

facing, cared about their well-being, and genuinely wanted to help them

to be successful. This created a more motivating environment for all

concerned.
