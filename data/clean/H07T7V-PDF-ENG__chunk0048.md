# the time.

A norm is a behavior that the people around you expect. Maybe

it’s written down in the employee manual. Very often it’s not. It’s

community policing. It’s what the people around you expect. If you go

out of line and violate a norm in a community, you will know that fairly

quickly and you will either come back into line or you’re just not going

to stick around very long.
