# boundaries, and time zones.

We worked with the leadership team of a fast-moving consumer goods

company’s EMEA region on realigning their meeting practices. They

were suﬀering from meeting proliferation, where their entire days were

spent sitting in meetings, leaving little time to get “actual work” done.

We challenged them to be as speciﬁc as possible, considering questions

like: Who must really be in the room, and who can receive the minutes

afterward? What preparation is expected? What are our practices for

virtual and face-to-face meetings, including length, how to ensure all

voices are heard, and how much time to spend on checking in? And

after the meeting itself, is there time for debrieﬁng and sensemaking?

After going through that exercise, the team created—and upheld—new

standards, and meeting quality improved dramatically.
