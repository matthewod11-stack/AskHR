# Group-Level Performance Variables

Research with teams has advanced our thinking about the impor- tance of and differential prediction of group-level outcomes, but we have barely skimmed the surface. Jackson (1992) identiﬁed six types of team effectiveness outcomes: creative decision making, problem solving, task execution, internal group processes, group stability, and external liaison. Cohen and Bailey (1997) categorized team effectiveness criteria into somewhat different categories: per- formance, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes. In their sum- maries, Jackson (1992) and Cohen and Bailey (1997) reviewed previous research, concluding that criterion type moderated the relationship between predictor variables and team effectiveness. Perhaps a hierarchical (or nested) taxonomy that integrates both sets of group-level criteria (Jackson’s and Cohen and Bailey’s) would be useful.

A test of a multilevel model found that group-level processes affect group-level creativity; they moderate the relationship be- tween aggregated individual creativity (group-level predictor) and group-level creativity (Taggar, 2002). Emerging evidence also sug- gests that individual- and group-level personality characteristics pre- dict different individual- and group-level performance variables and have different types and forms of relationships with group-level performance variables as compared with individual-level perfor- mance variables. These complex ﬁndings are described in some- what more detail later in this chapter.
