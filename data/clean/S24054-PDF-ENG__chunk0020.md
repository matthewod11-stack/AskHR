## diﬀerent people express and receive love diﬀerently in relationships—

and it’s an essential skill that leaders must learn.

Let me give you some examples. During the middle part of my career

at the Patriots, I played with two wide receivers, Julian Edelman

and Randy Moss. If you wanted Julian, who had incredible mental

toughness, to play his best, the way to do it was to tick him oﬀ. I would

say something like “Jules, wow, you look really sluggish today.” He’d

glare at me and be so angry, but I knew he’d channel that energy to

prove me wrong and go out and play great. Randy, who’s a Hall of Fame

receiver, responded better to validation: “Man, Randy, you look amazing

out there.” Even in practice, if I went too long without throwing the ball

to him, I’d go over and say how much I valued him and remind him that

I was always looking for him on every play. I wanted to make sure he

never slowed down.

Whether you’re a coach or a team captain, you learn that you spend

90% of your time working with the 10% of players who are the

most challenging. I had one particular teammate who was a naturally

gifted oﬀensive player. But he had faced many adversities during his

childhood and young adult life. I spent a lot of time with him, and

I felt that he had unhealed traumas that led to insecurities. It was diﬃcult for him to trust anyone or control his emotions. He didn’t

recognize that his behaviors were self-destructive and distracting to

his teammates. I wish he’d found some professional support that could

have shown him a way to take advantage of the opportunities he had in his career. It’s very diﬃcult to see people struggle like that, but you

have to keep trying to ﬁgure out what might work to motivate them

and try to help them achieve their potential. The time spent managing

challenging teammates is worth it because you’re not just bringing
