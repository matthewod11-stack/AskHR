## HBR / Digital Article / The Strengths and Weaknesses that Set Founders Apart

Our research revealed that while no founder CEO is the same, they

do exhibit distinctive characteristics as a collective. Founder CEOs are

“spikier” than their professional counterparts. Their strengths are more

pronounced, but so are their weaknesses. For example, founders often

possess extraordinary creativity, vision, and persistence. These traits are

not just slightly better than average — they can be exceptional.

On the ﬂip side, their weaknesses are often just as extreme. For instance,

their hiring mistakes might be more than just occasional missteps,

veering into systemic issues that permeate the organization.
