## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 77

reduced levels of performance (Brotheridge & Grandey, in press; Wright & Cropanzano, 1998). Personality traits like Emotional Sta- bility and Extraversion are likely to be important predictors of burnout. Consequently, there may be value in assessing the emo- tional demands associated with various jobs on the personality— performance relationship. A taxonomy of emotional demands could focus on “emotional taxes” due to task demands (as with sur- geons who face life-and-death decisions), interpersonal demands (such as sales representatives who have frequent interactions with challenging customers), and emotional control required by the job (for example, ambulance technicians who encounter emotionally demanding circumstances). With the development of a theoreti- cally relevant taxonomy of emotional demands, we believe re- searchers could explore the effect these emotional factors have on the nature and magnitude of the relationship between speciﬁc per- sonality traits and performance or affective outcomes.

Research on cognitive ability has illustrated that complexity of the job, as determined by job knowledge requirements, is an im- portant determinant of the relationship between ability and perfor- mance (Hunter, 1986; Schmidt, Hunter, Outerbridge, & Trattner, 1986). Consequently, models of job performance must also include job complexity as an important situational variable. Is job complex- ity likely to be an important moderator for personality? We do not know. However, if it is, it may be because complexity is associated with greater discretion or autonomy, in addition to a need for more job-speciﬁc knowledge. Furthermore, if the job is too simple or too complex for the person’s skills, it may have implications for motiva- tion (not intrinsically motivating if too simple a job) or anxiety (if too difﬁcult, it may increase the emotional labor of the job). Given this, research that extends our understanding of the role of job com- plexity on personality-performance relationships is important.

While these alternative perspectives suggest areas where our model will likely be reﬁned, we believe that both our general model of the effects of person and situation variables on behavior and our speciﬁc model of how four personality traits relate to motivation and subsequently to performance can guide research. In the gen- eral model, we have proposed that at least two situational con- structs (cooperative demands and competitive demands) are required to explain the relationship between the two interpersonal
