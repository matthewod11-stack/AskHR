Therefore, to fulfill the above- mentioned conditions, it becomes imperative that employees in these companies in particular and in all organizations in general ought to be motivated by management using appropriate motivational strategies to bring about job satisfaction and enhanced production. It was on this basis that Drucker (1980. 230) emphasized that “the work of management is to make people productive” so as to achieve superior performance, and gain competitive edge in the organization. In doing so organizations do set their objectives on profitability, sales volume, delivery schedules, quality and so on which are often reflected in their mission and vision statements. These statements can only be achieved if employees are motivated to increase performance and productivity in the organization.
