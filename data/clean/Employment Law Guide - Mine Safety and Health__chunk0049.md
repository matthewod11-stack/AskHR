# notiﬁcation of a violation; and

vi. The eﬀect of the penalty on the operator's ability to continue in business.

The higher penalties in the ﬁnal rule are intended to increase the incentives for mine operators to prevent and

correct violations. Penalties, however, increase more signiﬁcantly for large mine operators, operators with a

history of repeated violations of the same standard, and for operators whose violations involve high degrees of

negligence or gravity. The maximum penalty for a regular assessment is now $70,000.

Some violations are of such a nature or seriousness that use of the formula would not result in an appropriate penalty. In these cases â€” most often involving fatalities, serious injuries, and unwarranted failure to comply

with standards â€” MSHA may waive the formula and propose a "special assessment." In developing such an

amount, the facts are independently reviewed to determine a penalty amount that will have the deterrent eﬀect

contemplated by the Mine Act. Title 30, Section 100.5 of the Code of Federal Regulations contains the regulations governing this civil penalty process.
