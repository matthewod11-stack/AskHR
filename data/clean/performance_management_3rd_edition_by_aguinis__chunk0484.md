- Organizational structure. For example, is the current structure conducive to fast and effective communication?

- Organizational culture. Organizational culture includes the unwritten norms and values espoused by the members of the organization. For example, is the current organizational culture likely to encourage or hinder innovation and entre- preneurial behaviors on the part of middle-level managers?

Think about your current employer (or last employer, if you are not currently employed). Take a look at Table 3.2. Where does your organization stand in regard to each of these important internal and external issues? Regarding the external issues, what are some of the opportuni- ties and threats? Regarding the internal issues, what are some of the strengths and weaknesses?

After external and internal issues have been considered, information is collected regarding opportunities, threats, strengths, and weaknesses. This informa- tion is used to conduct a gap analysis, which analyzes the external environment in relation to the internal environment. The pairing of external opportunities and threats with internal strengths and weaknesses leads to the following situations (ranked from most to least competitive):

- 1. Opportunity + Strength = Leverage. The best combination of external and internal factors occurs when there is an opportunity in the environment and a matching strength within the organization to take advantage of that opportunity. These are
