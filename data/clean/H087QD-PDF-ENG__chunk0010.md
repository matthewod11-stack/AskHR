# Our Findings

We asked our full-time workforce in the U.S., across all of our lines

of service and at every level of our organization, to tell us about

key dimensions of their work experience, including engagement, well-

being, and perceived opportunities for learning and advancement. We

had over 27,000 responses, which we were able to map to respondents’ diﬀerent ways of working: in person, remote, or hybrid.

Knowing that there likely wouldn’t be a one-size-ﬁts-all solution for all of our teams, particularly given the diﬀerent kinds of work they perform

and clients they serve, we hoped to ﬁnd clues as to the best way to

optimize our teams’ experiences.
