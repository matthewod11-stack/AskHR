# Intelligence

Binet and Simon (1916b) distinguished between two types of intelligence: ideational intelligence and instinctive intelli- gence. Ideational intelligence operates by means of words and ideas. It uses logical analysis and verbal reasoning. In- stinctive intelligence operates by means of feeling. It refers not to the instincts attributed to animals and to simple forms of human behavior but to lack of logical thinking. This two- process kind of model adumbrates many contemporary mod- els of thinking (e.g., Evans, 1989; Sloman, 1996), which make similar distinctions.

What are some examples of the kinds of problems found on a Binet-based test (e.g., Terman & Merrill, 1937, 1973; R. L. Thorndike, Hagen, & Sattler, 1986)? In one version 2-year-olds are given a three-hole form board and required to place circular, square, and triangular pieces into appropriate indentations on it. Another test requires children to identify body parts on a paper doll. Six years later, by age 8, the char- acter of the test items changes considerably. By age 8, the tests include vocabulary, which requires children to deÔ¨Åne words; verbal absurdities, which requires recognition of why each of a set of statements is foolish; similarities and differ- ences, which requires children to say how each of two objects is the same as and different from the other; and comprehen- sion, which requires children to solve practical problems of the sort encountered in everyday life. At age 14, there is some overlap in kinds of tests with age 8, as well as some different kinds of tests. For example, in an induction test, the experi- menter makes a notch in an edge of some folded paper and asks participants how many holes the paper will have when it is unfolded. On a reasoning test, participants need to solve arithmetic word problems. Ingenuity requires individuals to indicate the series of steps that could be used to pour a given amount of water from one container to another.

The early Binet and Simon tests, like those of Cattell, soon were put to a test, in this case by Sharp (1899). Although her results were not entirely supportive, she generally accepted the view of judgment, rather than psychophysical processes, as underlying intelligence. Most subsequent researchers have accepted this notion as well.
