Small moments reveal your intentions. When asking important

questions on, say, strategy or priorities, Kehimkar advises saying: “I

have a perspective on this, and I’d like to hear from you ﬁrst.” This

demonstrates that you care about their ideas, and you’re not just

pushing your own agenda.

Be the lightning rod.

Think carefully about what you expose your team to. “As the leader,

you need to be the point person for all cross-team communication

and shield people from the toxicity,” says Chatman. Put simply: You

get to decide how much of the organizational drama reaches them,

absorbing the criticism and tension yourself to spare the team. “This is

a sacriﬁcial act,” Chatman says. You’re not blocking information; rather,

you’re ﬁltering and framing it to preserve your team’s energy and keep

people moving forward.

Big challenges like layoﬀs and rising competition are obvious, but

there’s no need for a gloom-and-doom update that has no eﬀect on their

day-to-day work, adds Kehimkar. “Keep people in the loop and don’t

sugarcoat, but help them focus on the sphere they can control.”
