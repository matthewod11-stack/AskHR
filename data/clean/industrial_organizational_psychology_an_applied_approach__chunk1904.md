# Learning by Modeling Others

Also called social learning, modeling is a vitally important method of learning for training in organizations. As the name implies, employees learn by watching how other employees perform, or model, a behavior.

Modeling as a learning technique is astoundingly pervasive and is the basis of the behavioral modeling method of training discussed earlier. Think of how you first learned a sport such as baseball. You probably learned your batting stance by watching a favorite player. Why do you dress the way you do? Mostly because you

model the way your peers and idols dress. We are most likely to learn through modeling when we are unsure about how to behave. For example, in our first days on a new job, we watch how others act. Do they take only the allotted time on breaks? Do they treat customers politely? Do they pay attention to their work? We learn how to behave at work by watching others so that we will fit in. A theory of job satisfaction that will be discussed in Chapter  hypothesizes that we even decide how satisfied we will be in our job by matching our level of job satisfaction with the levels exhibited by other employees.

Modeling is most effective under certain conditions. These conditions mainly involve characteristics of the employee whose behavior is being duplicated and the characteristics of the person attempting to model that performance.

Characteristics of the Model Of course, we do not model everyone else’s behavior. Instead, we tend to model behavior of people who are similar to us, who are successful, and who have status. For example, if we were deciding what new clothes to purchase, who would we model? If male, would we pick Barbara Walters or Ted Kennedy? After all, both have status and have been successful. No, instead we would look for someone who was more similar to us in both gender and age.

Likewise, if we are going to model our golf swing after someone, who would it be? Almost certainly, we would choose someone on the professional tour because of his or her status and success. But which player would it be? It would not be one of the worst golfers on the tour. Instead, we probably would choose Tiger Woods, Anika Sorenstam, or another successful golfer. Finally, which successful golfer would it be? It would probably be the successful golfer who was most similar to us in terms of race, sex, hair color, hometown, style, and so on.

This raises an important point about models in industry. We tend to look for a model who is similar to us. For modeling to be effective, the appropriate role models for employees should be similar to them in significant ways. That is why it is essential that a school faculty have both minority and female teachers, that an organization have both minority and female managers, and that television shows portray all types of people in different occupational roles.

Characteristics of the Observer For an employee to model another’s behavior, three conditions are necessary (Bandura, ). First, the employee must pay attention to the behavior of other employees. All the role models in the world will be unable to effect a behavior change in an employee if the employee pays no attention to the role model.

Second, the employee must be able to retain the information that is being modeled. Have you ever watched a person dance, and then later tried the dance yourself? For most of us it is difficult to do if there are many steps to remember (for some of us it is difficult to do if there are only two steps to remember!). Thus, even though we might have been paying close attention, there were too many behaviors to recall or retain. That is why training techniques that use modeling concentrate on only a few behaviors at a time.

Finally, the employee must have the ability or skill to reproduce the behavior that is seen. For example, suppose a new employee observes a veteran employee winding coils. If the new employee does not have the proper dexterity, technique alone will not enable the employee to be as successful as the veteran. Thus, it is important to limit the scope of the behaviors being modeled, so that they are at a skill level that can be reproduced by the observing employee.
