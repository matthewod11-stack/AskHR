## unified explanation for strategic persistence with underperforming workers.

Another contribution is that we integrate insights on the effects of institutional and

social pressures on human resource practices (See Chiang & Birtch, 2010; Hayek et al., 2016;

Thomas & Inkson, 2007) with firm-level factors to develop an integrated framework of

factors to explain persistence with underperforming workers. In addition, although firms that

operate in high relational contexts are affected by different institutional factors (Peng, 2014),

to date, studies have not incorporated these into our understanding of underperformance.

Exploring this issue would help to not only enrich our cross-cultural understanding, but shed

light on the more intricate processes through which strategic persistence occurs. In so doing,

we capture the various factors that help to explain persistence with underperforming workers.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. First, we present a review of the

literature on the paradox of success, “too much invested to quit” perspective, nepotism and

legitimacy. The research context and method are then examined. We then set out our findings

on underperforming workers. The final section outlines the implications for managers and
