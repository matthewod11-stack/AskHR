It is therefore of utmost importance to conduct an exhaustive diagnosis in order to plan adequately for the medium- and long-term, using a participatory model based on the right balance between the commercial, public and social sectors (Rifkin, 1997). As we saw previously, at present and with an eye toward the future, municipal management should move towards carrying out six basic functions (Blanco, 2012): administer, coordinate, manage, integrate, invest, and plan. These functions should lead to the achievement of strategies based on actions and tasks that the municipalities can develop in an autonomous way and to their capacity to provide quality services.

Sharing common goals, managing talent, improving team work, and management’s leadership are key elements for the organization to function.
