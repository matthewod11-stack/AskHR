# Javier, Alfonso & Luis 59

In the late seventies, democracy came to Spain, and with it a change in expectations. People wanted quality of life, which brought about a new social reality. For this reason, the municipalities began to assume responsibility for the infrastructures and services necessary to narrow the gap between themselves and other surrounding European countries (Cecilio, 2000).

At the municipal level, the city councils constructed and equipped most of the installations in existence today. They also provided the funds for putting in place the management and development of sports policies aimed at disseminating what had been coined “sports for everyone”. They have therefore played a key role in the development and implementation of this concept (Andrés & Delgado, 1995). As a consequence, these installations are under municipal management. However, user satisfaction should not and cannot be considered separate from the business philosophy and objectives on which the future of the organization is based (Luna-Arocas & Mundina, 1998). Celma (2008) affirms that the generation of change witnessed in these past few years in Public Administration, and more specifically in the sports sector, stems from the different management forms and models they adopted in response to the essential need to adapt the organization and its services to the level of quality that citizens demand in regard to physical activities and sports. There are three important elements in sports management at the municipal level. They are:

- Active: participants, users, entities, associations - Structural: equipment, activity space - Organizational: administration and management

Applied sports management becomes a process that requires a coordinated and interdependent effort (Mestre, 2013) on the part of the manager of some basic elements, namely:

a) The sports needs and objectives of the population (socio-demographic profile) b) Legislation regarding sports c) The sports manager d) Sports organizations and their directors e) Planning as a work method f) Economic resources (budget) g) Sports programs h) The sports installation i) The trainers j) Ethics and values of sports k) The environment and its protection l) Quality

Among its various functions, one of the principal tasks of the City Councils is sports management. In Spain, municipal sport is the greater reality in regards to the different manifestations of sports in existence presently. Although it is not alone, municipal sports dominate “sports for everyone”, and consequently, all categories of sports events and activities, not only at the municipal level, but also at the national and international level.

According to Teruelo (2009), the people have a right to satisfy their need to practice and attend sports events, and it is the responsibility of the City Councils to create sports centers, team sports, and local competitions. Municipal sports managers need a space where they can measure and compare their areas of management with those of other municipalities with a similar population. This information is needed in order to share common criteria and to become aware of other criteria, thereby promoting innovation. There is also a need to set up work groups in various areas of management to evaluate the services provided and the sports installations in general (benchmarking).

Benchmarking is a systematic and constant evaluation of the products, services and work procedures of an enterprise, and is recognized as one of the best practices to improve an organization (Spendolini, 2005).
