By demonstrating the potential of a new style and eliciting positive

feedback, small wins start to shift the leader’s motivation from necessity

(“I need to be a better communicator”) to possibility (“I’m working on

communicating better because it will help me accomplish my goal”)

and identity (“I’m working on communicating better because that is

who I want to be”). These subtle changes help leaders become more

self-reﬂective and persistent—invaluable traits for anybody trying to

deﬁne and anchor a new self.
