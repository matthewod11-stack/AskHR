# Court Cases

It is important to point out that each case is based on the totality of the

circumstances. Courts in some cases to be a binding contract have interpreted the

language used in the employee handbook. "In the landmark case Toussaint vs. Blue Cross

and Blue Shield ofMichigan (1980), the Michigan Supreme Court rule in favor of an

employee when the company failed to follow the disciplinary procedure outlined in its

21

employee handbook prior to firing the individual" (Jenner, 1994, p. 23). The courts

position was it recognized statements created a contract of employment according to the

handbook. So, if the handbook clearly delineated the termination process and any action

that did not comply with what was written was a violation of corporate policy.

In another case, according to Jenner (1994), the New Jersey Supreme Court, in

Woolley vs. Hoffinann-La Roche, Inc. (1985) ruled that the company's policy written

statement on job security created a binding contractual obligation. One reason the court

may have ruled this way is because the employee had reasonable expectation of job

security, and that termination would not occur. It is also possible that said company may

have terminated employees in the past but never had verbiage that existed in their manual

challenged.

Another case involving Hoflinan-La Roche, Inc., which is a pharmaceutical firm

that had in its employee ha.ndbook five reasons an employee could be terw.inated. The five

reasons for termination from the pharmaceutical firm are retirement, resignation, layoff,
