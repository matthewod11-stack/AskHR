Falk and Ichino (2003) measured peer effects on output in an experiment, exploit-

ing the ability to assign workers to pairs randomly, which avoids the problem of

endogenous peer selection that is typical in most (though not all) field data sets.

They recruited subjects to stuff letters into envelopes for four hours for a fixed fee

(with no performance bonus). Some subjects did the activity by themselves; others

did it in the presence of a randomly assigned peer. Random pairing led to closely

matched output. The absolute deviation of output within each actual peer group

averaged 20.6—much smaller than 99% of simulated absolute deviations within

artificial pairs composed of solo subjects. Pairing workers also raised output on

average (about 10%). Pairs were more likely to escalate each others’ output than to

tacitly collude by goofing off. The estimated effect of a one-unit increase in output

on the peer’s output was 0.14 units, close to the 0.14-0.18 estimated from field data
