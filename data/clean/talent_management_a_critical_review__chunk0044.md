## R.E. Lewis, R.J. Heckman / Human Resource Management Review 16 (2006) 139–154

Without understanding the context of the decision to implement a multirater intervention (why that particular intervention was chosen and the goal in implementing it) it becomes impossible to evaluate its impact. Perhaps the high performing organizations that did not implement multirater tools facilitate feedback via other, equally effective, means and the organizations that experienced low returns did so because of factors other than the multi-rater tool.

Boudreau and Ramstad's (2005) call to develop a decision science that frames talent-related decisions thus warrants attention. Better specification of the decision framework also permits a more proactive use of the talent/resource classification approaches used so effectively by Zuboff (1988) and Barney (1991). For instance, Zuboff's observation that it is possible to “informate” a low-value/difficult-to-replace job and transform it to one of “high value” does not address the question of when one should informate a job. That is, the pre-conditions to that decision are not specified. Similarly, classifying talent as “hard to imitate” does not advance the discussion of when investments should be directed to making a talent pool hard-to-imitate.

Thus, while we know from the strategic HRM literature that well-developed practices can have an effect on organizational outcomes we have no clear theory or principles to guide when or which organizational pools should be targeted. These decisions are crucial — allocating organizational resources to one talent pool or another (or to talent in general rather than technology or marketing investments) should be defended not only on the basis of some outcome measure but also on the basis of a strong link to strategy and the framing of strategic options.

To that end it is possible to propose a high-level hierarchy of the components of a strategic talent management process (see Fig. 3). This hierarchy is by no means intended to be a fully specified model. Instead, it is a conceptual framework that begins to separate the questions that have been addressed in the TM and strategic HRM literature so as to provide perspective. The components of the hierarchy are in the left column. In the right column are the questions that arise as one moves down the hierarchy and, illustrating the systems implications of the hierarchy, questions that
