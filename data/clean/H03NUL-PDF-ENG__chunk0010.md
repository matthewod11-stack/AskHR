# HBR / Digital Article / Tech Companies Should Speak Up for Refugees, Not Only High-S…

These eﬀorts to directly help and advocate for refugees have been

admirable. But collective action from the tech sector would be more eﬀective for swaying the opinions of the courts and the public. The

amicus brief would have been the best opportunity for an industry-wide

statement that the government should welcome refugees, particularly

those who have already cleared stringent security checks to enter the

U.S.

A stronger stance would be in the companies’ best interest.

Corporations are facing greater pressure from their employees and

customers to take a stand on political issues and uphold certain values.
