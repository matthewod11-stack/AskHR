## naturally-occurring data (as well as experimental data).

The behavioral economics approach I describe in this essay is a clear departure from the “as if”

approach endorsed by Milton Friedman. His “F-twist” argument combines two criteria:

- 1. Theories should be judged by the accuracy of their predictions;

- 2. Theories should not be judged by the accuracy of their assumptions.

The empirically-driven approach to behavioral economics agrees with criterion (1) and rejects criterion

(2). In fact, criterion 2 is rejected because of the primacy of criterion 1, based on the belief that replacing

unrealistic assumptions with more psychologically realistic ones should lead to better predictions. This

approach has already had some success: This paper reports many examples of how behavioral theories

grounded in more reasonable assumptions can account for facts about market outcomes which are anomalies

under rational theories. More empirical examples are emerging rapidly.
