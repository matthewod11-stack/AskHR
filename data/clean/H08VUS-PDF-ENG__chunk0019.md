## you accountable and stick with your new pursuit, and that framing will

remove the pressure to achieve.

- 3. Embrace “productive discomfort.”

The feeling of being out of your depth is the point. Learn to recognize

it not as a sign of incompetence or failure but as an opportunity

for growth. If the challenge starts to feel easy, or you start to get

comfortable, raise the bar.

. . .

If you stick with something long enough, you’ll naturally improve, of

course, and that progress will feel rewarding. But your goal as a strategic amateur is not mastery. It’s the mental ﬂexibility that emerges from

repeatedly stepping into beginnerhood. For high performers, holding

back the instinct to measure, compare, and outperform is diﬃcult. But

that restraint is what makes this process powerful. Paradoxically, by

regularly making yourself a “nobody” in new contexts, you’ll become a more eﬀective “somebody” in your leadership role. So the next time

you feel you’ve arrived at the proﬁciency plateau, don’t double down on

what you know. Step into something you don’t.
