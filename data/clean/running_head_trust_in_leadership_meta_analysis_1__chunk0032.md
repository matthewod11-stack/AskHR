# Trust and Leadership

Trust plays a critical role in most work relationship theories (Ferris et al., 2009;

Fulmer & Gelfand, 2012). Yet, the conceptualisation of trust forms a topic of considerable

debate. Some scholars accept unidimensional definitions, describing trust as a psychological

state consisting of a willingness to be vulnerable due to positive expectations of another party

(e.g., Rousseau et al., 1998). However, multidimensional operationalisations distinguishing

between different trust bases are also widely adopted. The most popular describes cognitive

and affective forms of trust (McAllister, 1995). Cognitive trust refers to rational assessments

of qualities such as ability and reliability that are built on the outcomes of previous
