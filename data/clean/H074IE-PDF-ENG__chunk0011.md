# HBR / Digital Article / Expecting a Bad Performance Review? Here’s How to Prepare.

- Why do I think I will get a poor review, and why now?

- What specific results did I commit to that I didn’t deliver?

- How does my current performance compare to the past?

- Did I have an interaction with a client or coworker that did not go as I

planned? What happened? Why?

These questions and your answers will enable you to focus on the

specific work you need to do to improve rather than on an amorphous

goal. For example, did you commit to meeting X goal by Y date and

failed to do so? If so, is it possible to address this shortfall now and make

amends, showing your boss that you’re capable of graciously correcting

an error in a timely manner? By asking yourself Littlefield’s questions,

you may also discover that you’ve erroneously assumed that there’s a

problem when in fact, there’s no tangible justification for your fears.

If you found that your assumptions were off base, it may be that your

self-awareness needs a tune-up.
