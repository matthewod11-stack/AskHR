# Analysis

We carried out a single variable ANOVA where the dependent variables were the leadership dimension scores and the grouping variable was team participation. For significant ANOVA, follow-up univariate analyses were carried out. Finally, we examined the correlation between the number of seasons played and the level of leadership skill for each of the nine leadership dimensions measured.
