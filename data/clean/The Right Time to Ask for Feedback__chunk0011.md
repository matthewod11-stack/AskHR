Thisopenness to critique and constructive criticism not only leads toimproved work but also helps in fostering a growth mindset,which is essential for personal and professional development.When you prioritize learning and improvement over seekingaffirmation, you become more resilient in the face of setbacks andbetter equipped to handle the inevitable challenges that arisethroughout your career.
