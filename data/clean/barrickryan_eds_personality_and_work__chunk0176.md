## Job Characteristics That May Interact with Happiness

Based on current research on the functions of moods and emo- tions, we argue that any associations between happiness and pro- ductivity will not arise simply from an attitude-behavior link. In addition, although there are many general effects of well-being that may lead to slightly higher productivity, we do not expect many of these effects to be large. Instead, we believe that the most impor- tant effects of happiness and well-being on worker productivity are complex and varied, and most will interact with the nature of the tasks being performed. In this section, we speculate on the nature of job characteristics that could possibly interact with happiness to result in a more productive worker.
