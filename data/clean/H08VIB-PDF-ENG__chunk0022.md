# Don’ts

Don’t prepare alone. AI can speed things up, but don’t let that rush

you into working in isolation. Take time to pause, reﬂect, and share

your drafts with topic experts before distributing the memo to all

participants. This applies also to ready-to-use prompts you plan to

share ahead of the session. Pressure-test them with a colleague, gather

feedback, and ﬁne-tune before you hit send.
