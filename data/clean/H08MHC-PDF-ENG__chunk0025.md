# HBR / Digital Article / Design Your Transformation for Simplicity — Not Efficiency

Transformed workﬂows are much more complete when deployed.

To get to ROI as fast as possible, eﬃciency-focused organizations

typically adopt minimum viable workﬂows (i.e., incomplete workﬂows). This means eﬃciency-focused leaders are, in eﬀect, charging staﬀ with

the task of making an incomplete transformation work.

Conversely, with designed simplicity, new and revised workﬂows

don’t get deployed until they are complete, meaning there are no gaps or ambiguities staﬀ have to ﬁgure out on their own.

Necessarily, workﬂows, tools, templates, and playbooks are developed

before the transformation is implemented, not after. Though iterative

improvement will no doubt happen, any faults in such workﬂows are minor enough that delays in improvement don’t hamper staﬀ as they

put the workﬂow into practice.

Staff’s user experience and input are a priority. The eﬃciency-based approach relies on staﬀ to ﬁll in the gaps in incomplete workﬂows. While relying on staﬀ experience to compensate

for process deﬁciencies may work for smaller changes, transformations

are about fundamental changes to tasks or even entire value chains. In other words, the eﬃciency approach is predicated on staﬀ

compensating for workﬂow deﬁciencies using experience they don’t

have. Not only does this explain why the eﬃciency approach doesn’t

work, but it’s also why it’s associated with declining morale.

Consider a procurement function that hasn’t previously been

responsible for sustainability. Leadership decides to add this to

procurement’s remit – a transformation because it’s a fundamental

change in responsibility. As part of this transformation, procurement

must add sustainability metrics to its supplier selection criteria.

Ideally, the leaders who decided to undertake the transformation

will also have determined what speciﬁc KPIs are required and what
