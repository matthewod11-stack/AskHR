# Workplace Violence

chapter 

The problem with self-reports, of course, is that people may not know they are stressed or may not be truthful in their answers. So, in addition to self-report inventories, physiological and biochemical measures of stress can be used. Physi- ological measures include blood pressure, perspiration, heart rate, and muscle tension, and biochemical measures include cortisol and catecholamine levels (Sulsky & Smith, ).

In the past decade, the issue of workplace violence has received considerable interest from psychologists and HR professionals. In part this interest has been spurred by statistics such as these:

In ,  employees were murdered at work. In , .% of fatal workplace injuries in the United States were the result of homicide. Approximately . million incidents of workplace violence take place annually in the United States. Eighteen percent of violent crimes were committed while the victim was at work. Twenty-five percent of workers in the UK were victims of some form of bullying at work in the past five years.

Though the issue of workplace violence has received increasing interest, the homicide rate in the workplace has steadily declined from a high of % of all fatal workplace injuries in  to .% in .

Though more than % of homicide victims at work in  were men, homicide is only the fourth most common cause of fatal workplace injuries among men (traffic accidents, falls, and being struck by an object are the first three), but is the second most common cause of fatal workplace injuries among women (traffic accidents are the most common). The gender differences in work- place violence can be explained by the fact that men traditionally work in higher- risk occupations such as mining that have high levels of fatalities caused by such other means as driving and construction accidents.

Though these figures are certainly attention getting, from an HR perspective they can be misleading, as a relatively small portion of the homicides are com- mitted by current or former employees. Incidents of workplace violence can be placed into one of three categories. The first category, representing % of job- related homicides, is violence against an employee occurring as a result of a crime being committed. The most common examples are employees assaulted during the commission of a robbery. In fact, taxi drivers and convenience store clerks are the two kinds of workers most susceptible to workplace violence (working the graveyard shift at a -Eleven store may have more than chronological meaning).

The second category, representing % of job-related homicides, is violence against law enforcement officers (e.g., police officers, sheriffs, FBI agents) or security guards while they are in the line of duty. Law enforcement officers have a homicide rate of . per , employees, and the rate for security guards is . per ,. The average for all workers is . per ,.

The third category, representing % of job-related homicides, is violence against an employee or supervisor as an act of anger or vengeance by another

employee, a customer, or a jilted lover. It is this category of violence that most involves HR professionals and has captured the imagination of the public. Of the homicides in this category, % are committed by current employees, % are committed by former employees, % involve domestic violence, and % involve other causes (Grossman, ).

Employee violence against other employees is usually the result of interper- sonal disagreements. For example, an employee of Prescolite in Arkansas killed another worker and wounded seven others because the employee was upset that he was being harassed by his coworkers.

However, coworkers can be assaulted when employees take out their anger against a supervisor. Thirteen percent of workplace-violence incidents involve employees seeking revenge against a supervisor as a result of being fired, laid off, or subjected to some form of negative personnel action. Here are some examples:

An employee at the Connecticut State Lottery was upset with his supervisors for “not listening to him,” and the employee killed four coworkers before killing himself. Suicide is done by % of employees committing workplace violence. A Tulsa, Oklahoma, Wendy’s employee, angry because his boss asked him to start work early, fired  shots from a .-caliber handgun, wounding his supervisor and five other employees. An employee in a Micropure Plant in California killed two and wounded four employees because he was frustrated with his job. Gregory Gray, a former case manager for Conrad House Community Services in San Francisco, killed a former coworker because he was angry about being fired. Gray brought a handgun, shotgun, and ax to his former place of employment, and had his handgun not jammed, more people would have been killed. After being fired, Paul Calden killed three supervisors at Firemen’s Fund Insurance before shooting himself. Fernando Ruiz shot his supervisor at Dahn’s Fresh Herbs in Houston after his boss threatened to fire him. Larry Hansel used a -gauge shotgun to kill two company executives he believed were responsible for his being fired.

Recently, psychologists have expanded their studies of workplace violence to include behaviors referred to as mobbing and bullying. Mobbing and bullying consist of hostile, alienating, and unethical behavior among employees. Examples of such behavior include intimidating a person, excluding or isolating someone socially, spreading malicious gossip that is not true, yelling at a person, using pro- fanity, and belittling a person’s opinions or work. Research suggests that about one in five employees in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Can- ada report being the victim of bullying. This expanded definition of workplace violence has been adopted by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, whose definition of workplace violence includes the following actions:
