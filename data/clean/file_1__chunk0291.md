employees with higher education are expected to perceive both societal and workplace gender inequality to a greater extent than employees with lower education.

Hypothesis 4: there is a positive relationship between education and employees’ perceptions of (a) societal and (b) workplace gender inequality.

Place of living may also have an influence on employees’ perceptions of societal and workplace gender inequality. In many rural areas, the work of women is labeled as ‘unskilled’, and the work of men is defined as ‘skilled’, even if the tasks require similar and equal skills (Shunfeng and Aimin, 2006). Women are, thus, perceived as having lesser ability leading to a situation where male employees get better salary and treatment than female employees with same abilities. Furthermore, home-based and unwaged work done by women is often undervalued in rural areas, while work of men is more ‘visible’ in terms of monetary and physical terms (Shunfeng and Aimin, 2006). It might be thus suggested that gender inequality persists more in rural rather than in urban areas. Accordingly, living area is suggested to have an impact on whether and to what extent employees perceive both societal and workplace gender inequality to exist so that employees living in rural areas are proposed to perceive both types of gender inequality to a greater extent than employees living in urban areas.

Hypothesis 5: there is a positive relationship between living in a rural area and employees’ perceptions of (a) societal and (b) workplace gender inequality.

There is growing evidence that experiences and awareness of harassment contribute to social inequalities, including gender inequality (Walby, 2004). Harassment has been empirically found to be associated with a range of negative personal and organizational consequences such as poor health, lower job satisfaction, and depression of employees, whilst organizations can experience higher absenteeism, higher turnover, and lower productivity (Mikkelsen and Einarsen, 2002). Furthermore, experience of harassment can decrease employee’s employment status and hours worked. Since psychological harassment is strongly related to gender inequality, it can also increase people’s perceptions of gender inequality (Salin, 2009). Thus, employees, who experience either psychological or sexual harassment or both, are expected to perceive both types of gender inequality to a greater extent than those ones who do not experience harassment.

Hypothesis 6: there is a positive relationship between experience of sexual harassment and employees’ perceptions of (a) societal and (b) workplace gender inequality.

Hypothesis 7: there is a positive relationship between experience of psychological harassment and employees’ perceptions of (a) societal and (b) workplace gender inequality.

According to the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999), sector gender composition is one of the factors maintaining differential treatment of men and women. While in gender-balanced groups, gender-based differences are less salient, in work environments dominated by men or women, differences between genders become more salient (Gutek and Morasch, 1982; Kanter, 1977). Furthermore, working in an environment with disproportional representation of women effects women’s gender identity so that
