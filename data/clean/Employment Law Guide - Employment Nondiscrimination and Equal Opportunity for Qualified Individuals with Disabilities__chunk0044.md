# Penalties/Sanctions

OFCCP conducts compliance evaluations and complaint investigations assessing whether Federal

contractors and subcontractors are in compliance with Section 503. If a violation of Section 503 is found

during compliance evaluations or complaint investigations, OFCCP will ask the Federal contractor or subcontractor to enter into conciliation negotiations. If conciliation eﬀorts succeed, the contractor will enter

into a binding conciliation agreement with OFCCP that includes corrective actions the contractor will take and

may also include the submission of follow-up reports from the contractor, for a ﬁxed period of time, to assure

compliance. If conciliation eﬀorts fail, OFCCP may refer the matter to the Solicitor of Labor with a

recommendation for the institution of enforcement proceedings to enjoin the violations, to seek appropriate relief, and to impose appropriate sanctions, or any combination of these outcomes.

If OFCCP ﬁles an administrative complaint, the matter will be referred to an Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ"),

who hears the case and recommends a decision to the Department of Laborâ€™s Administrative Review Board (â€œBoardâ€). If the contractor, subcontractor, or OFCCP is dissatisﬁed with the ALJ's decision, they may appeal the decision to the Board. In both situations, the Board will then issue a ﬁnal agency decision. Thereafter, either party may ﬁle a petition with the Board for further review by the Secretary. If a majority of the

Board determines that the petition presents a question of law that is of exceptional importance and warrants

review by the Secretary, the Board will refer the case to the Secretary. Where the Secretary accepts review, the

Boardâ€™s decision does not become ﬁnal unless and until the Secretary completes the review. If the

Secretary does not accept review, the Boardâ€™s decision becomes ﬁnal. The Secretary may also exercise discretion to direct the Board to refer the case.

If the Board ﬁnds that a violation of Section 503 has occurred, it may order the contractor or subcontractor to

provide appropriate relief, which may include back pay and beneﬁts, and restoration of employment status, for

the victim(s) of discrimination. Depending on the circumstances, violations also may result in cancellation,
