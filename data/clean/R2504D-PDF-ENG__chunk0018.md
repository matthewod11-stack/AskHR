groundwork in a peace process. When Mitchell arrived in Northern

Ireland, he faced a centuries-old conﬂict and communities divided

by religion, politics, and blood. What distinguished his approach was

extraordinary patience and methodical foundation building. He spent

the ﬁrst months doing nothing but listening, conducting more than a

hundred in-depth interviews with people across Northern Irish society

—including paramilitary leaders, clergy, politicians, and ordinary citizens aﬀected by “The Troubles.”

Mitchell’s signature contribution was the Mitchell Principles—a set

of commitments to democracy and nonviolence that created a moral

framework for negotiations. Instead of demanding immediate solutions,

he acknowledged that peace required building blocks. His team

meticulously documented every agreement and concession, creating

what he called “gardens of agreement” in a landscape of conﬂict.
