# 10.6 PAY STRUCTURES

Regardless of whether organizations implement a reward system based on perform- ance, they face the question of what salaries to assign to new employees. An organiza- tionâ€™s pay structure classifies jobs into categories based on their relative worth. To return to the university example at the beginning of this chapter, how does this particular university assign salaries to new professors? Specifically, how does a university decide to create salary bands for each of five categories (i.e., instructor, senior instructor, assistant professor, associate professor, full professor)? How wide should these bands be? How many bands should be included in the system? Information to answer each of these questions is provided by what is called a job evaluation.
