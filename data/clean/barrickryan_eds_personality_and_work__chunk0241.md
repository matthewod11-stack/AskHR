# the strength of the relationship between relevant personality traits and work performance.

Research from an ecological perspective of personality simi- larly suggests cooperation and competition as fundamental fea- tures of environments. Central to this perspective is the concept of affordances, which Gibson (1979) deﬁnes as the fundamental util- ities or action possibilities that the physical or social environment offers. Baron and Boudreau (1987) extend this concept and argue that in social settings, the opportunity to engage in certain behav- iors is dependent on the actions of others. In particular, coopera- tive and competitive behaviors require reciprocal, coordinated behavior from others. Speciﬁcally, Baron and Boudreau suggest that “helpfulness requires a helper and a recipient, competition requires a rival, and dominance requires a subordinate” (p. 1223). Traits are thus expressed when other people in the organizational environment afford (allow and encourage) their expression. In particular, environments tend to differ on the extent to which they afford demonstrations of competitive and cooperative behavior (Baron & Boudreau, 1987).

In accordance with the ecological notion of affordances, our focus on cooperative and competitive demands is driven in part by an observation that behavior in social settings corresponds to key individual differences. The two personality traits that appear to have the strongest inﬂuence on social behavior are Extraversion and Agreeableness (Graziano, Hair, & Finch, 1997; Lucas et al., 2000). The typical extravert craves excitement, is adventurous, and tends to be assertive and dominant, as well as sociable. Thus, the social behavior of highly extraverted individuals is characterized by demonstrations of dominance and competitiveness (Lucas et al., 2000). In contrast, agreeable people are helpful, trusting, and friendly; they are cooperative and work well with others. Highly agreeable employees prefer social situations that are characterized by cooperation, close relationships, and interpersonal harmony and acceptance.

The effects of cooperative and competitive situational differ- ences on Extraversion and Agreeableness have been empirically demonstrated. In a meta-analysis, Mount, Barrick, and Stewart (1998) reported that Agreeableness was the most important per- sonality predictor of performance in jobs involving interactions
