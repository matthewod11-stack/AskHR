It is also important to note that organizational cultures might vary along some of the same dimensions as societal cultures. One manifestation of that might be a correspondence between the cultures of organizations and the characteristics of the broader societal cultures in which they are embedded (Schneider, 1988). The logic behind this parallelism is that societal culture inï¬‚uences shared managerial assumptions and values (Kanungo & Jaeger, 1990), and managers, in turn, shape the organizational culture. Work by Aycan, Kanungo, and Sinha (1999) supports a correspondence between societal culture and human resource management practices, and empirical studies by Chatman, Polzer, Barsade, and Neale (1998) and Robert and Wasti (2002) both support the existence of individualism and collectivism dimensions of organizational culture.
