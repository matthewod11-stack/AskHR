# Technological Environment

A recommendation for a technological environment is based on the author’s 15 years

of professional experience in Atlas Copco company. Currently, Atlas Copco uses too

many platforms across different parts of organization. SAP and more versions of this

system in different customer centers, Cloud for customer, SharePoint, Teams,

Yammer, Workfront, Clevork. While most of them should make life easier for

employees, it leads to inefficiency and employee frustration. A suggestion is to review

available platforms and see from employee’s perspective which platforms are the

most efficient for them and unify their usage. A second suggestion is link to employee

expectation regarding technological platforms to the available working device. The

author strongly recommends that employees working equipment should match their

private equipment, which today is not the case in every market.
