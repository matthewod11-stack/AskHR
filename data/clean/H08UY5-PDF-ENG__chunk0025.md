# the CEO’s vision.

To conﬁrm you’re staying focused, ask yourself:

- In which areas can you truly move the business? (As opposed to letting

what’s most visible or urgent capture your attention.)

- How will you plan to listen broadly enough to see the full picture—and

how will you act boldly to shape it?

- How are you managing your time between reacting and leading—and

what needs to shift?

- What are you concerned you might be missing—and who will you trust

to tell you the truth?

. . .

When you step into the CEO role, the pressure to have all the answers

is real. But no one expects you to solve everything overnight. What they

do expect is leadership that tackles the most important questions facing

the business and clear communication about what you’re focused on,

what you’re learning, and where challenges lie.

Taking the time to ask the right questions during your ﬁrst 100 days

can help you build a stronger foundation of trust, alignment, and

excitement to build on when it comes time to execute.

And as you reﬂect, one ﬁnal question is worth asking: Are you showing

up the way you intended—and would your team say the same?
