(because of the direct personal inﬂuence that psychology may have on its students), and possess both practical ingenuity and philosophical insight (because of the complex pedagogy required for the course). In short, “the teacher is everything” (p. 91). Wolﬂe (1942) reviewed more than 100 studies on the ﬁrst course in psychology, published after the 1910 reports, andconcluded:“Now,30-oddyearslater,wearestilldebating many of the same issues and being embarrassed by the same difﬁculties. Many of the same recommendations considered necessary in 1909 are still necessary in 1942” (p. 686).

Intradisciplinary concerns were often matched by interdis- ciplinary conﬂicts. Wolfe’s (1895) commentary on resource allocation in the sciences for “the new psychology in under- graduate work” (p. 382) predicted this competitive struggle on campuses. Hill (1929) described the conﬂicts over control of psychology personnel and curricular decisions in state uni- versities. In 1945, James B. Conant, president of Harvard, appointed six psychologists and six nonpsychologists from university faculties, corporations, and research institutes to a University Commission to Advise on the Future of Psychol- ogy at Harvard. Wolﬂe (1948), as secretary of the APA, reviewed The Place of Psychology in an Ideal University (Gregg et al., 1947/1970) and said: “By all means read this book. . . . Psychologists have been a vigorous, sometimes belligerent, but never well united group. . . . This scattering of psychologists all over the campus is bound to be puzzling” (p. 61). In his presidential address for the APA Division on the Teaching of Psychology, Pressey (1949) juxtaposed the prestige accorded psychology in the Gregg et al. report with an observation about Harvard’s Redbook: “Psychology ap- pears to have no recognized place in the program presented in General Education in a Free Society” (p. 149). Thus, on the eve of the post–World War II boom in higher education, psy- chology was still “getting its act together” on institutional status and curricular coherence.

Ratcliff’s (1997) analysis of curricula focused on the con-
