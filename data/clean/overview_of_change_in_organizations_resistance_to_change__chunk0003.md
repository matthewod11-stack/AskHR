Change management is not a distinct discipline with rigid and clear-cut boundaries. On the contrary, change management theory and practice rely on several disciplines and social science traditions. For example, management education and learning theories, which help us understand the behaviour of those in charge of change management, cannot be thoroughly discussed without reference to psychology theories. The latter, in their turn, cannot be discussed without “mentioning the theory of knowledge (epistemology), which is a genuine philosophical field per se” (Raza et al, 2018).

- 2. Literature review. Overview of Change in Organizations

Change is a migration from the current situation to a desired future situation. Change management as a practical activity is aimed both at configuring the desired situation and at managing the successive transition through several intermediary stages until the desired situation is reached. Change in organizations is represented by any change in the organization’s state of affairs. As a discipline, change management focuses on voluntary organizational change in response to environmental factors, or on the organization’s own initiative, a change that must be managed in order to achieve a desired future condition (Srivastava & Agrawal, 2020; Georgalis et al, 2015).

Change management has been also defined as “the process of continually renewing an organization’s direction, structure and capabilities to serve the ever-changing needs of external and internal customers” (Sundus et al, 2017, p.17). It also refers to the adoption of an idea, procedure, process or behaviour that is new to an organization. The major objective of change management is “to maximize the collective benefits for all people involved in the change and to minimize the risk of failure to change. The major obstacle to change management is resistance to change” (Sundus et al, 2017, p.17).

This being said, it has been acknowledged for a long time that change in organizations tends to focus on achieving one of the three following types of outcome: individual change, group change or system change (Sandelands, 2010).

For example, Maslow and the early human relations movement focus predominantly on the role of motivation and individual behaviour. Lewin and Schein, while acknowledging the importance of individual behaviour for the overall performance of the organization, claim that a change in group behaviour is the best way to improve performance. Senge, however, adopts a systemic approach to improvement. He considers the interconnectedness of organizational life as “the most important factor and consequently, the starting point of change” (Burnes, 2017, p.8).

Change management refers to the achievement of an optimal design of the path leading from the starting point to the goal. Pursuing this interpretation of the concept, change management does not involve defining the content of the goal itself, nor developing the methods to achieve such corporate goals or strategies (Guidetti et al, 2018).

Since change management refers primarily to handling change by taking into consideration the

human factor, the related methods can be applied to three elements (Lauer, 2021, p.7):

- “Individuals: they form the smallest social elements of organizations. Without their active participation, change in organizations is not possible”. Change management in relation to individuals means not only the adjustment of skills to new challenges, but also the promotion of a positive attitude required for the change goals and the involvement in it.

- “Corporate structures: they include the formal structural and processual organization, as well as the strategies and resources”. Their change is simple on paper, but the informal structures which tend to develop in the long term and through evolution often resist such changes.

- “Corporate culture: the permanent, rather informal structures which are responsible for attitudes, values and informal rules of behaviour form the corporate culture and are independent of the individual to a significant extent”. A change at an individual and structural level, without the involvement of corporate culture, is often affected by considerable issues or even bound to fail completely.
