Content creation AI can support content creation across all teams—whether summarizing sales calls or generating 2rst drafts of strategy documents, blog posts, web pages, and even images and visualizations.< We see teams using AI to edit and polish their work, then bring it in as a last-minute proofreader;

AI can automatically write in your company’s style and apply your tone of voice guide; follow your preferred document structures; or even provide feedback on writing. It can then translate your work into diFerent languages or repurpose it for diFerent audiences, channels, or programs.:
