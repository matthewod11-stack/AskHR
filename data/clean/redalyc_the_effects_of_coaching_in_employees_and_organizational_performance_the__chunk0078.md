## Figure 3. Results of model estimation (standardized solution)

To confirm that the model has an acceptable fit, we examine the goodness-of-fit indices of the

multidimensional structural model. The results show a good fit according to the usual criteria

(Kline, 2005; McDonald & Ho, 2002): the Satorra-Bentler scaled c2 = 167.7799, with 171

degrees of freedom and p=0.1155. Other commonly used indices are as follows: NNFI=0.971,

CFI=0.975, IFI=0.976, MFI=0.933 and RMSEA <0.03. The matrix of standardised residuals

does not show the need to make any additional changes. All of the modification indicators of

the model are low, which suggests that neither adding nor removing any relationships will

improve the fit. Retaining the existing model thus avoids capitalising on chance and maintains

model parsimony, as Barret (2007) and Goffin (2007) recommend. Based on the goodness-of-

fit indices reported above, we can conclude that the global fit is good and that the errors are at

acceptable levels. Examining the individual results, we observe that all of the relationships are
