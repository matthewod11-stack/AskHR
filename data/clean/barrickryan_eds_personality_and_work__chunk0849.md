# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 305

Type of Task Steiner (1972) developed a set of task types (additive, compen- satory, conjunctive, and disjunctive) that potentially moderates re- sults and is thus helpful in organizing research ﬁndings. If another task type—creative—were added to Steiner’s set, the differences in the Barrick et al. (1998) and Barry and Stewart (1997) results would be conﬁrming rather than seemingly conﬂicting. Speciﬁcally, Bar- rick et al. (1998), working with manufacturing teams (primarily compensatory tasks), found that Conscientiousness (as well as Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Emotional Stability) predicted team performance. Barry and Stewart (1997), working with teams involved in creative problem-solving tasks, found that Conscien- tiousness did not predict team performance. Given the ﬁnding that dependability (one facet of Conscientiousness) correlates nega- tively with criteria involving creative tasks (Hough, 1992), these re- sults, when organized according to a revised Steiner taxonomy, demonstrate that task type moderates the relationship between predictor (personality) variables and team effectiveness. We need additional research on the taxonomic structure of tasks to better deﬁne the boundaries beyond which our results do not generalize.

Type of Team Cohen and Bailey (1997) reviewed research on teams conducted between 1990 and 1996, concluding that type of team (work teams, parallel teams, project teams, and management teams) moderated relationships between independent and dependent variables. Other classiﬁcations of teams exist (Gibson & Kirkman, 1999; Kli- moski & Jones, 1995). Perhaps instead of types of teams, we need a set of independent variables on which teams vary that can be used to proﬁle team situations. Such a set of variables would be helpful in increasing the precision of our theories and models.

Type of Job or Job Characteristic In addition to more team-based work settings, also more common are customer service jobs requiring interpersonal skill and au- tonomous work settings, all of which have been shown to moderate relationships between personality variables and performance. For example, degree of interpersonal interaction is a job characteristic that moderates relations between personality characteristics and
