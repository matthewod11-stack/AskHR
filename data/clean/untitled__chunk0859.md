## CONCLUSION: RELATIONS AMONG THE VARIOUS MODELS OF THE NATURE OF INTELLIGENCE

might say that those who are splitters are actually talking of “talents” rather than intelligence, or that they are merely slic- ing the same “pie” everyone else is eating, but very thinly. Sometimes different names are used to reﬂect the same construct! For example, what once was the Scholastic Aptitude Test later became the Scholastic Assessment Test and still later became simply the SAT, an acronym perhaps belatedly asserted to stand for nothing in particular. The change in the name of the test points out how, over time and place, similar or even identical constructs can be given names in order to reﬂect temporally or spatially local sensi- bilities about what constitutes desirable or even acceptable terminology. Many similar efforts, such as referring to what usually is called intelligence as cognitive development (R. L. Thorndike, Hagen, & Sattler, 1986), point out the ex- tent to which the history of intelligence is in part a battle over names.

In a sense, the history of the ﬁeld of intelligence bifur- cates. Some investigators, perhaps starting with Boring (1923), have suggested we deﬁne intelligence as what intelli- gence tests measure and get on with testing it; other investi- gators, such as Spearman (1904, 1927) and Thurstone (1938) view the battle over what intelligence is as determining what should be tested.
