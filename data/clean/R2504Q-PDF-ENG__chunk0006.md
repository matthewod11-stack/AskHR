# many obstacles.

Whether you’re a parent facing a healthcare challenge, a manager with

a supply chain failure, or a CEO trying to lead through an economic

crisis, it takes great fortitude to navigate shifting contexts with scant

data and no handbook. Three new story-driven, research-backed books

could have helped me do so more easily, and they can help you now. The

authors assert that courage is a skill you can develop and strengthen in

yourself and on your team, and they provide insights and inspiration on

how to be brave—in both everyday and extraordinary situations that call

for you to be and do more than you think possible.
