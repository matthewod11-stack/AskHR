## Data on the share of health workforce by sector (public

or private) indicate that for highly paid occupations, such

as physicians, men are more frequently employed in the

private sector than women (49.2% vs 39.2% respectively, P < 0.001). However, the contrary is the case for low paid jobs, such as personal care workers, where women are more

frequently employed by the private sector (53.0% vs 81.8% for men and women respectively, P < 0.001). This contrast illustrates a gender imbalance, with men more likely to

obtain private sector jobs in occupations where public sector

wage ceilings often exist, whereas women are more likely to

obtain lower paid private sector jobs, which tend to offer less

job security and favour part-time employment.
