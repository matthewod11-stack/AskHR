- 9. Data analysis

A survey was developed and conducted on a sample of 97 participants. The data was analysed usin

g the z-test responses. The

where the results for each hypothesis implemented an agree/ disagree response ignoring the neutral percentage of agree and disagree has been calculated for each of the six hypotheses. A Null hypothesis has been designed for each hypothesis. The averages for the ‘agree’ responses have been calculated for each hypothesis and the mean and standard deviation also been calculated by incorporating its values in the respective for mulas. Because of the z-test analysis, the z-score was calculated, and the results were achieved in every hypothesis. All hypotheses were validated and based on the z score both the hypotheses and/or the null hypotheses results are provided in Table 1. The critical value for all the hypotheses is set to 1.65 as the value of α is 0.05. This value is considered due to the reason that the accuracy is assumed to be 90% and the upper tail test has been taken into practice.
