# MICHAEL C. STURMAN

The theory postulates that individuals proceed through three phases of skill acquisition. The ﬁrst phase (the cognitive phase) involves a strong demand on the general mental ability of the performer as performance strategies are formulated and tested. During this phase, performance speed and accuracy increase quickly, and the demands on cognitive ability are reduced. The second phase (the associative phase) involves the reﬁnement of the stimulus–response connections developed in the ﬁrst phase. Here, that are associated ‘‘perceptual with ‘‘an individual’s facility in solving items of increasing complexity y[and] the speed of processing’’ (Ackerman, 1988, p. 290). Ultimately, the third and ﬁnal stage of performance is characterized as automatic. In this phase, tasks can be completed competently even without the full attention of the performer. Performance in this phase is less dependent on per- ceptual speed ability and more so on psychomotor ability (deﬁned as processing speed and accuracy independent of information processing per se; Ackerman, 1988).
