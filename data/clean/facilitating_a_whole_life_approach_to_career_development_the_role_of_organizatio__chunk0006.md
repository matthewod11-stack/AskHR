Abstract This article focuses on the ‘‘whole-life’’ approach to career development. A review of the ways in which career paths have been conceptualized over time demonstrates that increasing consideration has been given to nonwork factors (i.e., personal life and family life) in defining careers. The whole-life perspective on career development acknowledges that employees are striving for opportunities for professional development as well as individualized work–life balance, which changes over the life course. Although the careers literature has emphasized interorganizational mobility as the primary mechanism for achieving these goals, whole-life career development can also be achieved within a single organization when organizational leadership is willing to address employees’ work–family needs. This article addresses how leaders across organizational levels, including executive-level leaders and first-line supervisors, can foster whole-life career development. In addition to beneficial outcomes for employees, potential competitive advantages for organizations implementing the whole-life approach to career development are discussed.

What is the best way to ensure career development in the modern workforce? We contend that to be managed effectively, career development must be approached from a ‘‘whole-life’’ perspective. Con- sistent with the recognition that career patterns are shaped by employee decisions made in response to nonwork circumstances (Greenhaus & Kossek, 2014; Valcour, Bailyn, & Quijada, 2007), a whole-life approach to career development recognizes that professional development does not occur in isolation but in the context of the employee’s personal and family needs, which change over the life course. By tending to employees’ changing career, personal, and family needs, organizations can retain valuable employees and gain competitive advantage.
