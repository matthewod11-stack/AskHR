## Rutgers University Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and

Proﬁt Sharing. The main reason to pursue employee ownership is that

the business can remain private and stay true to its purpose while

allowing the founder to share the value created with the staﬀ. There

can also be tax beneﬁts with certain types of structures. The main risks

are that the company will have to take on debt if it’s buying out the

founder’s shares, that it may face additional regulatory requirements,

and that tension could arise between employees who are looking to cash

out their shares at retirement and those who are investing for the future.
