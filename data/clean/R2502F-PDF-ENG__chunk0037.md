This can be challenging. Negotiators should make their own rituals

explicit up front, share the intentions behind them, and discuss how

adopting each other’s rituals may introduce diﬃculties. In one instance

of this, two teams from Switzerland and Spain were starting a long-

document, which they named hoja de ruta (road map), written in

Spanish because one of the Swiss team members was ﬂuent in the

language. In this document, they outlined the ﬁve positive behaviors

they expected from each other during the negotiations, codifying

collaborative intentions on both sides. Then they created a ritual

around it: At the start of meetings, each person would brieﬂy share

a positive hoja de ruta behavior performed by a member of the other
