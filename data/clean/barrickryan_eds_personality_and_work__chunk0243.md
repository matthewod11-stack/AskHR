## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 73

Data from 146 managers (Barrick & Mount, 1993) indicated that the predictive validity of two relevant personality predictors, Con- scientiousness and Extraversion, was greater for managers in jobs high in autonomy compared with those in jobs low in autonomy. Lee, Ashford, and Bobko (1990) also found that the degree of au- tonomy a person has in his or her job moderated the relationships between Type A behavior and job performance, job satisfaction, and somatic complaints for employees from a variety of organiza- tions. Based on these Ô¨Åndings, we believe the degree of autonomy in the situation moderates the effects of all relevant personality pre- dictors on performance.
