# Nurture your network.

A robust internal network is always beneﬁcial for career success. It

has even more value within the uncertainty of a reorg, when access to

information and opportunities could be a game changer for you. The

more supporters you have at your company, the safer you are.

Make a list of people to connect with, including allies, former

managers, and mentors or sponsors. In addition to nurturing your close

ties, consider colleagues with whom you’ve fallen out of touch, like

former teammates, cross-functional partners, or coworkers you used to socialize with. Dormant ties oﬀer more novel insights and advice and

can be a valuable source of knowledge and social capital.

One client whose role was in jeopardy received two separate oﬀers from

other areas of his company by reinvigorating his network. Your internal networking eﬀorts can also unlock external opportunities should the

need or desire arise.

Do some scenario planning.

Contemplating how the reorg may unfold and how you might respond

can help you react more dynamically to the unknown future.

What are plausible outcomes of the reorg for you? Scan the current

reality of the business, considering inﬂuential internal and external

factors. Think about the worst case, best case, and several outcomes

between these poles, and determine how you would handle each one.

Document action steps and consider timing: Are there strategies and

tactics you should pursue sooner rather than later? One of my clients,

for example, identiﬁed a possible opportunity to shift into a new

department. Energized by this scenario, he started contributing ideas to

the group’s manager and took on a problem they were facing. Getting
