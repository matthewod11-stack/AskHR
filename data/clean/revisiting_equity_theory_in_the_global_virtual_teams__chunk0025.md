Descriptive and correlation results are shown in Table 2. H1 and H3 are not supported – quite the opposite, statistically significant opposite effects are reported. Table 3 and Figure 1 show a significant positive relationship between Benevolents’ perceptions of equity and job satisfaction (β = 0.183, p < 0.001). As for Entitleds, the relationship between their perceptions of equit y and satisfaction is negative (β = −0.081, p < 0.05).

Our H2 was tested using linear regression with a subsample containing Equity Se nsitives and is supported. The squared term is significant. Therefore, as shown in Figure 2, the Equity Sensitives experience increasing satisfaction when they move from being underrewarded to being equitably rewarded, and their satisfaction starts dropping once they start being overrewarded. This finding aligns with the inverted U-shaped curve proposed by Huseman et al. (1987).
