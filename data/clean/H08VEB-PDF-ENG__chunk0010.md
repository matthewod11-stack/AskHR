## your jaw clenching, heart quickening, or tight shoulders, these can all

be early signs of stress, anxiety, or anger. Also, pay attention to your

behaviors: Are you talking more than usual or withdrawing? Diving into

work or putting things oﬀ? Your responses can point to underlying

emotions. Finally, track your energy. If you feel a sudden drop or

unexpected surge, there’s likely an emotion just under the surface.

Just as we have “tells” that we can learn to notice and read, other people

are also constantly oﬀering cues to their emotions. Facial expressions,

tone of voice, body language, and behavior all transmit emotional data

you can observe.

Pay attention to body language—our bodies often broadcast what

people aren’t saying aloud. Is your coworker leaning in or pulling away?

Making eye contact or avoiding it? Watch for any inconsistencies. If a

colleague says, “everything’s ﬁne” with a ﬂat tone or a forced smile,

that mismatch between their words and expression is a sign they’re

not “ﬁne.” Emotions also show up in changes from someone’s baseline

behavior. For example, if a normally engaged team member suddenly

grows quiet, that’s worth noticing. These shifts don’t tell you exactly

what they’re feeling, but they signal it’s time to get curious.
