## the company on a path toward digital transformation, its head of

talent, inclusion, and culture, Tina Mylon, championed a seven-year

learning initiative called Transforming Schneider Leadership, or TSL

(which I played a part in designing and delivering). It was built on

the core principle that transformation should be the business not of

individual leaders but of a leadership community. TSL provided a space

for Schneider’s executives to think and relate in new ways, through an

intensive experiential workshop that took a playground approach, while

also helping them develop the skills for implementing a digital strategy,

through a digital boot camp at which people acquired and practiced

using speciﬁc innovation tools. Since the program began, the company

has tripled in value and grown into a provider of innovative and

sustainable energy-management solutions. The organization is prized

for its diversity and has improved retention and increased internal

promotions. There’s no way of knowing how much of that success is

directly attributable to TSL, but Mylon has in that time reported seeing

the company’s extended pool of leaders grow “more diverse, skilled,

and impactful, and more connected to each other,” something that has

served the company well in its cross-unit innovation and culture eﬀorts.
