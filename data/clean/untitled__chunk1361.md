## AND POST-MECHANISM TO POST-POSITIVISM 232

In an early appraisal of American social psychology, Albion Small (1916) traced the springs of that intellectual enterprise to the Civil War, when people “whose thought-world had been stirred to its depths by the war found themselves in 1865 star-gazing in social heavens that had never looked so con- fused nor so mysterious” (p. 724). The war had dispelled American’s naive beliefs that “a constitution and laws en- acted in the pursuance thereof would automatically produce human welfare,” thus forcing recognition “that work was ahead to bring American conditions into tolerable likeness of American ideals” (pp. 724–725). Social psychology, according to Small, was born of those social conditions, a maturation of intellectual consciousness, including a growing independence from European thought and, as his astronomi- cal metaphor intimates, an appreciation of the “social” as a phenomenon appropriate to scientiﬁc study. Another early historical appraiser, Fay Karpf (1932), wrote that only with these preconditions “did an American intellectual self- conscientiousness begin to assert itself in the ﬁelds directly of signiﬁcance for social psychology” (p. 213).

This wide-angled perspective on the history of social psy- chology appreciates the multiple and diverse efforts under- taken in at least a half a dozen disciplines to render rational, coherent explanations of social action and the relations between the individual and society. It is a history that ulti- mately must attend to classic texts as varied in their rendition
