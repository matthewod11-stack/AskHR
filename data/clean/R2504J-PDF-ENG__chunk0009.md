In this article we’ll explain why visualizations are so important to the

communication of strategy and describe, using a detailed example,

how to create one that will win buy-in from employees and investors

alike. We’ll conclude by showing that despite the powerful eﬀect

presentations on deals include one, and when they do, it often isn’t

designed to have impact. All told, fewer than 20% of visualizations do an

eﬀective job of describing companies’ strategic decisions.
