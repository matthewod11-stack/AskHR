## Intelligence as Arising from Individual Differences: The Differential Model

McNemar (1964) was one of the most explicit in speculating on why we even have a concept of intelligence and in linking the rationale for the concept to individual differences. He queried whether two identical twins stranded on a desert island and growing up together ever would generate the notion of intelligence if they never encountered individual differences in their mental abilities.

Perhaps without individual differences, societies would never generate the notion of intelligence and languages would contain no corresponding term. Actually, some lan- guages, such as Mandarin Chinese, in fact have no concept that corresponds precisely to the Western notion of intelli- gence (Yang & Sternberg, 1997a, 1997b), although they have related concepts that are closer, say, to the Western notion of wisdom or other constructs. Whatever may be the case, much of the history of the Ô¨Åeld of intelligence is based upon an epistemological model deriving from the existence of one or more kinds of individual differences.
