## Fig. 19 eNPS Atlas Copco in region Europe, US and China

In Europe, an eNPS = 37 shows a big difference compare to the other two markets.

17 employees would recommend the company to their friends to become coworkers,

while 4 are detractors. However, 14 employees out of 35 have neutral opinion, this

represents 40%. In other markets, size of detractors is similar to the European one,

but the biggest differences are linked to the number of passive employees. The US

has 20% and China has 23% passive or neutral employees, while the number of

promoters represents 71% of employees in US and 66% of employees in China. The

eNPS score in all three markets is higher than the industrial benchmark, however

significant differences are visible mainly between Europe eNPS=37 and US eNPS=

63.
