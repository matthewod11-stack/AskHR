## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 15

narrower level offers higher ﬁdelity (predictive accuracy). More- over, to the extent that subcomponents are measured reliably, those measures afford valuable information about middle scorers on the broad dimensions, because middle scorers may score high on some subcomponents of a broad factor but low on others.

Perhaps the major beneﬁt of measuring subcomponents per- tains to predictive validity. As diverse commentators (Goldberg, 1993a; Mershon & Gorsuch, 1988; Paunonen & Ashton, 2001) have pointed out, the amalgamation of measures into broad factors leads to a loss of speciﬁc variance, thus lowering the overall validity of the composite (for important potential exceptions, see Ones & Viswes- varan, 1996). Consequently, an investigator who seeks optimal pre- dictions should use as many speciﬁc sources of variance as statistical power, and thus sample size, will permit (Goldberg, 1993a).

The quest for high predictive accuracy leads to the develop- ment of measures at levels far more speciﬁc than the broad factors compared in lexical studies; such subcomponents are likely to pre- dict more powerfully than the single broad factor into which they are agglomerated. Even when more speciﬁc variables provide lit- tle predictive gain over the common factors, it can be useful to know which aspect of the common factor is responsible for the bulk of the correlation, thus providing more conceptual clarity.

How many hierarchical levels are needed? Eysenck (1991) de- scribed four for personality constructs. The lowest level includes iso- lated behaviors (talking with a stranger), and the second level includes recurring behaviors or habits (tending to talk to strangers). The third level involves clusters of interrelated habitual behaviors (sociability, liking to be with people), which one might think of as middle-level traits. The fourth level is composed of amalgamations of middle-level traits that form broad factors (such as Extraversion). Lexical studies suggest that this fourth level might itself be divided into two levels, including an even more highly abstract level such as is represented in composite factors like Evaluation, Social Propri- ety, and Dynamism. That is, one can blend the apparent primary personality factors to create a few higher-level combinations, as do some languages that combine the colors white, yellow, and red into a single word (translatable perhaps as “light/warm”) and the col- ors black, blue, and green into another word (“dark/cool”); Kay and McDaniel (1978) call these composite colors.
