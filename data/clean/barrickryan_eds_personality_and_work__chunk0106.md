# 16 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Lexical studies comparing the lower-level subcomponents of broad factors are still in their infancy. Given the high similarity in the Big Five representations in the highly related English and Ger- man languages, Saucier and Ostendorf (1999) tested whether such similarity extends to the lower-level subcomponents as well. They found that although not all of the subcomponents from each lan- guage replicate perfectly, most of them did. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the repli- cated hierarchical subcomponents of the Big Five included four facets each for Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness and three each for Emotional Stability and Intellect.
