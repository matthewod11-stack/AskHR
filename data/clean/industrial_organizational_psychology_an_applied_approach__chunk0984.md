# Types of Interviews

Perhaps a good place to start a discussion on interviews is to define the various types. Interviews vary on three main factors: structure, style, and medium.

Structure The structure of an interview is determined by the source of the questions, the extent to which all applicants are asked the same questions, and the structure of the system used to score the answers. A structured interview is one in which () the source of the questions is a job analysis (job-related questions), () all applicants are asked the same questions, and () there is a standardized scoring key to evaluate each answer. An unstructured interview is one in which inter- viewers are free to ask anything they want (e.g., Where do you want to be in five years? What was the last book you read?), are not required to have consistency in what they ask of each applicant, and may assign numbers of points at their own discretion. Interviews vary in their structure, and rather than calling interviews structured or unstructured, it might make more sense to use terms such as highly structured (all three criteria are met), moderately structured (two criteria are met), slightly structured (one criterion is met), and unstructured (none of the three cri- teria are met). The research is clear that highly structured interviews are more reliable and valid than interviews with less structure (Huffcutt & Arthur, ).

Style The style of an interview is determined by the number of interviewees and number of interviewers. One-on-one interviews involve one interviewer interviewing one applicant. Serial interviews involve a series of single interviews. For example, the HR manager might interview an applicant at : a.m., the department supervisor interviews the applicant at : a.m., and the vice-president interviews the appli- cant at : a.m. Return interviews are similar to serial interviews with the dif- ference being a passing of time between the first and s ubsequent interview. For example, an applicant might be interviewed by the HR manager and then brought back a week later to interview with the vice-president. Panel interviews have multiple interviewers asking questions and evaluating answers of the same applicant at the same time, and group interviews have multiple applicants answering questions dur- ing the same interview. Of course one could put together several combinations such as a serial-panel-group interview, but life is too short for such nonsense.

Medium Interviews also differ in the extent to which they are done in person. In face-to-face interviews, both the interviewer and the applicant are in the same room. Face- to-face interviews provide a personal setting and allow the participants to use both visual and vocal cues to evaluate information. Telephone interviews are often used to screen applicants but do not allow the use of visual cues (not always a bad thing). Videoconference interviews are conducted at remote sites. The applicant and the interviewer can hear and see each other, but the setting is not as personal, nor is the image and vocal quality of the interview as sharp as in face-to-face interviews. Written interviews involve the applicant answering a series of written questions and then sending the answers back through regular mail or through email.
