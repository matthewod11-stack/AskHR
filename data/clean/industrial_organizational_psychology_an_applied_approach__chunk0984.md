# Advantages of Structured Interviews

Though some HR professionals think they are using a structured interview because they ask the same questions of everyone, it is the job relatedness and standardized scoring that most distinguish the structured from the unstructured interview. The distinction is an important one because meta-analyses (Huffcutt &

Arthur, ; McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt, & Maurer, ) clearly indicate that interviews high in structure are more valid than unstructured interviews. This is true even when the interview is conducted over the phone (Schmidt & Rader, ). Furthermore, research (Campion, Campion, & Hudson, ; Cortina, Goldstein, Payne, Davison, & Gilliland, ) indicates that structured interviews can add predictive power (called incremental validity) to the use of cognitive ability tests.

From a legal standpoint, structured interviews are viewed more favorably by the courts than are unstructured interviews (Williamson, Campion, Malos, Roehling, & Campion, ). There are two probable reasons for this. One, structured interviews are based on a job analysis. A review of interview research by Campion, Palmer, and Campion () concluded that inter- views based on a job analysis will be more valid and legally defensible than ones not based on a job analysis. Two, structured interviews result in substantially lower adverse impact than do unstructured interviews (Huffcutt & Roth, ). In part, this is due to the fact that unstructured interviews concentrate on general intelligence, education, and training, whereas structured interviews tap job knowledge, job skills, applied mental skills, and interpersonal skills (Huffcutt, Conway, Roth, & Stone, ).

Though structured interviews result in less adverse impact, they are not completely immune from potential discrimination. Research indicates that even in highly structured interviews, white interviewers assign higher ratings to white applicants and African American interviewers assign higher ratings to African American applicants (Buckley, Jackson, Bolino, Veres, & Feild, ; Prewett-Livingston, Feild, Veres, & Lewis, ). This similarity bias, while trou- blesome, has a relatively small effect on interview scores (Buckley et al., ).

Although structured interviews are considered superior to unstructured ones, applicants perceive structured interviews to be more difficult (Gilmore, ). Furthermore, because the interview is so structured, applicants may feel that they did not have the chance to tell the interviewer everything they wanted to (Gilliland & Steiner, ).
