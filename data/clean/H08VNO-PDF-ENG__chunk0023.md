# Pro Tip

Employees aren’t waiting for leaders to be perfect. They’re waiting for

them to be consistent—especially when it’s inconvenient. Choose one

declared value. Then ask: where would living this value cost us — power,

money, speed, control? Then, take one visible action in that direction

and be consistent.
