# Performance Appraisal

physical and personal factors that surround the performance interview. Where the interview is held is an important factor. Experts disagree on this. Wex ley suggested the interview take place in either the appraiser's or appraisee's office.5S Stano believed the best place is a neutral territory that is relatively isolated from routine distractions.59 What seems important is that a place be selected for the interview that is comfortable for both parties, that will provide appropriate privacy, isolation, and no interruptions, and that does not serve to increase mystery, or distance, that already exits. Arrange- ments within the interview room are important climate factors, those that reduce differ- ences in status and distance facilitate effective communications. For example, side-to- side or corner seating is preferred to communicating across the expanse of a desk. Proxemic variables such as these are examples of non-verbal communication that can serve to reduce or expand status or hierarchical differences between appraiser and appraisee.

The impact of climate considerations, whether at the organizational-wide or personal level, may be observed at the appraisal interview level. If appraiser behavior is substantially incongruent with organizationJ characteristics experienced day-to-day by appraisees, distrust and suspicion will be engendered. If appraiser non-verbal behavior, that is, facial expression, gestures, posture, lack of eye contact, etc., contra- dicts what is said verbally, appraisees will get a mixed message. Non-verbal behavior is perceived as more reliable and accurate than the verbal message when they are in conflict.60 Communicators are constantly using two channels of communication, i.e., verbal and non-verbal.

The importance of climate factors at the individual level are illustrated by Stano. "Overall, communication will be more open and honest and problem-solving will be facilitated if the manager can genuinely consider the employee as equal and can appear spontaneous, friendly, supportive, sensitive to and interested in the difficulties of the worker, understanding, and cooperative, nonjudgmental with regard to feelings revealed, nonmanipulative, concerned for the dignity and worth of the individual, trusting, and confident of the employee's abilities." fit Figure 5.4 provides a list of factors which can constitute barriers to effective communication.
