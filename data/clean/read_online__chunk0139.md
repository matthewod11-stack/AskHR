# Original Research

larger at higher levels of WLBC, suggesting that those with family responsibilities might be less likely to quit than their counterparts. This is in line with other studies, for example by Almalki, FitzGerald and Clark (2012), who found lower intent to quit for those with children, and by Deery (2008), who found the number of dependent children to be an important moderator of the work-life balance. It seems that those with more children might be more risk averse, and that even if they experience higher levels of work-life balance conflict they may be more likely to stick it out in a job.

H1.d: The relationship between an increase in WLBC and intent to quit is strengthened under conditions of higher social support.

Social support is included here as a measure of the external context that an individual experiences as an employee. The WLBCâ€“social support interaction term is found to be significantly related to turnover intentions (p = 0.014). Figure 4 illustrates this relationship. At lower levels of WLBC, individuals with greater social support report being more likely to quit, and this is the same for higher levels of WLBC, although the difference between those with higher and lower levels of social support is greater at higher levels of conflict.

The significance of this relationship suggests that social support is an important enabler of exit for individuals experiencing higher levels of WLBC. The null hypothesis is rejected. This finding is also in line with various studies which found social support to be a moderator in the prediction of turnover intentions (see Haar, Roche & Taylor 2012). The fact that many studies have not found a moderating effect for social support (Haar 2004; Makola, Mashegoane & Debusho 2015), suggests the importance of context in the determination of these relationships. This result contributes to the growing body of literature, indicating that under the conditions investigated by this study, this moderating effect holds.
