# Theoretical implications

The following paper has some theoretical implications. Its main theoretical contribution is that it draws together different theoretical perspectives into the model of individuals’ perceptions of the gender pay gap. Based on social comparison theory, perceptions of the gap are suggested to be the result of the way individuals make comparisons among themselves, others, and the idealized images. Following the argumentation of equity theory, individuals who perceive themselves as under-rewarded and attach more attention towards pay injustice are expected to perceive the gender pay gap to a greater extent than others. Furthermore, according to the gender socialization perspective, men and women are socialized to perceive different organizational rewards as equal and, thus, perceive the gender pay gap differently. In a similar line of argumentation, occupational socialization theory states that older individuals are more socialized and, thus, are more aware of the gender pay gap than younger ones. Finally, derived from relative deprivation, marital status is expected to have an impact on individuals’ perceptions of the gap so that married individuals perceive the phenomenon to a lesser extent than unmarried ones.

In addition, based on the expectancy theory, sector gender composition is proposed to influence the way individuals perceive the gender pay gap so that individuals in female- concentrated sectors perceive the phenomenon to a lesser extent than individuals in male- concentrated ones. Derived from social dominance theory, it is assumed that individuals in moderate and high-status occupations possess higher standards of what forms a reasonable reward and, thus, perceive pay inequalities and the gender pay gap in particular to a lesser extent than individuals in low-status occupations.
