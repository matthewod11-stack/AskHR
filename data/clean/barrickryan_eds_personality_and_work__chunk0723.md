# 242 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Taken together, Figures 9.1 and 9.2 illustrate a generalizabil- ity theory approach toward partitioning measured behaviors into different sources of variance; the graphs would be more of an exploratory supplement to generalizability theory statistics. Even a conceptual understanding that situations may vary in their personality-relevant characteristics—even when those character- istics cannot be empirically measured—implies that data should be collected on individuals across different learning situations if it is important for “the situation” to be understood as a potentially important source of variance with potential main effects and in- teractive effects on learning outcomes. Furthermore, this would be an empirical policy-capturing approach to creating classes of situ- ations with similar features.
