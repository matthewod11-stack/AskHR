# Summary Points

- Personal developmental plans are a key component of a performance manage- ment system because they specify courses of action to be taken to improve perform- ance. Aperformance management system that lacks information about how to improve performance will not help employees learn skills beyond what they know and use already. In a nutshell, a good developmental plan allows employ- ees to answer the following three ques- tions: How can I continually learn and grow in the next year? How can I do better in the future? How can I avoid performance problems faced in the past? • Developmental plans focus on both the short term and the long term. Specifically, developmental plans address how to improve performance in the current job, how to sustain good levels of per- formance in the current job, and how to prepare employees for future advance- ment. In addition, developmental plans provide employees with growth oppor- tunities so that, even if advancement within the organization is not clear, employees are able to enrich their daily work experiences.

- Good developmental plans include a description of the specific steps to be specific developmental taken and objectives. Agood plan includes informa- tion about (1) developmental objectives, (2) how the new skills or knowledge will be acquired, (3) a time line regarding the acquisition of the new skills or

knowledge, and (4) standards and meas- ures that will be used to assess whether the objectives have been achieved. Learning objectives should be designed to take into account both the needs of the individual and those of the organization. • Developmental objectives can be achieved by one or more of the follow- ing activities: (1) on-the-job training, (2) courses, (3) self-guided reading, (4) mentoring, (5) attending a confer- ence, (6) getting a degree, (7) job rota- tion, (8) temporary assignments, and (9) membership or leadership role in professional or trade organizations. Developmental activities for specific objectives are chosen by the employee and his or her direct supervisor. This choice is guided by taking into account the employee’s learning preferences, the developmental objective in ques- tion, and the organization’s available resources.

- The direct supervisor has a key role in helping the employee define the scope of the developmental plan and in explaining the relationship between the developmental objectives and strategic priorities for the unit and the organiza- tion. The direct supervisor also has direct responsibility for checking on the employee’s progress toward achieving the developmental objectives and pro- viding resources so that the employee will be able to engage in the appropriate activities (e.g., courses, mentoring).
