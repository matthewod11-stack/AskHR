## HBR / Digital Article / A Data-Based Approach to Delegating

If you want to get granular on the return on investment from keeping

the time log, multiply the hours the delegated tasks used to take you

by an estimate of what your hourly pay is (the value of your total

compensation divided by the number of hours you work in a year).

Assuming you are paid more than the person to whom you delegated,

you will be able to see how much value you created by moving that work

over so you can focus on more strategic work.

. . .

Data mined from time logs can be supremely useful for deciding what

you should and could delegate. One beneﬁt of using this tool is how it

changes your view of the tasks that you have in front of you. The other?

You actually end up making space for more strategic things that should

consume your day and have an impact on how business functions.
