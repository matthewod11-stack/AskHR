# Recommendations for Documentation

Using the recommendations for documentation, write a journal entry of a classmate, coworker, or even yourself (from the perspective of your manager/instructor) detailing his/her performance for the past week. Also, write a

paragraph describing some of the challenges with your documentation, tying in some of the constraints that managers might experience in documenting performance behaviors. (cid:2)
