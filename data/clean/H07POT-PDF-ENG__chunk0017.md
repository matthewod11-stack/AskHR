# private data in the event of a layoﬀ.

In many companies, the day you’re notiﬁed that you’ve lost your job,

you must return your work computer, leaving you with little time to

remove your personal information. Keep in mind too that anything

that you do on company equipment can be monitored and obtained by

your employer. A 2022 study indicates that one in ﬁve companies are

tracking workers’ online activity or have plans to do so in the future. If

your work device contains personal data, download a copy and store it

elsewhere, like a personal cloud service such as a Dropbox account or a

USB thumb drive. The simplest way to separate personal from work data

is to use only devices you own for personal matters. Buying your own

computer is one solution — and there are plenty of new options for less

than $300 or refurbished systems.

Getting laid oﬀ can be a traumatic event, but a little bit of preparation

can go a long way. The more prepared you are, the less impactful the

layoﬀ will be on your mental health and ﬁnances — and the easier it will

be to ﬁnd a new job.
