## unintentionally pigeon-hole yourself in old impressions.

Don’t be shy with your stakeholders. Despite Mike’s signiﬁcant self- improvement eﬀorts, subsequent feedback indicated he was still

perceived as the “old Mike” — quick to anger and likely to lose his

temper in meetings. To continue his turnaround campaign, he launched

a deliberate conversation strategy with his major stakeholders: his boss,

peer leaders, and direct reports. Mike asked:

In my 360, I heard that my emotions were still getting in my way. I’ve

worked hard to eliminate that in the past year. Can you provide an

example of when you may have seen this behavior from me recently?

When asked directly, many admitted that they hadn’t seen “old Mike”

in a long time. In those conversations, they realized on their own they

were hanging on to past recollections. Mike left those meetings with

commitments from his stakeholders to watch more closely for the good

behavior — and to call him out immediately on the less desirable.

Left to our own devices, most of us default to what is known and

comfortable. That goes for our beliefs about others, too. If you’re a long-

term employee who’s ﬁnding that people in your organization aren’t

seeing you as you want to be seen, try these strategies to reposition

yourself internally and be known as the leader you’ve now become.
