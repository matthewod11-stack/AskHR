# Textbooks

The 1930s saw the greatest burst of publication for textbooks in the history of the ﬁeld. Margaret Floy Washburn’s The An- imal Mind had been dominant since 1908. Her fourth edition appeared in 1936. The most inﬂuential book of the era was Maier and Schneirla’s Principles of Animal Psychology (1935). The textbook provided a comprehensive overview of the ﬁeld, beginning with 11 chapters organized according to animal taxa. Material concerning receptor equipment, sensi- tivity, conduction, and the action system is provided for each group. The second part of the book is concerned with natively determined behavior, sensory function, and neural mecha- nisms in mammals. Part III addresses learning and mental processes.

The most comprehensive of the works was the three- volume Comparative Psychology: A Comprehensive Treatise (1935, 1936, 1940) by Warden, T. N. Jenkins, and Warner. The ﬁrst volume deals with principles and methods; the second volume with plants and invertebrates; and the third volume with vertebrates.
