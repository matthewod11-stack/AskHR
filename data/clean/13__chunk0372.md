# Employment Stage Models

Another key theoretical development in the area of dynamic performance research is the employment stage models developed by Ackerman (1987, 1988, 1992) and Murphy (1989). Ackerman’s work is focused on skill development; Murphy’s model applied Ackerman’s work to job perfor- mance. Both are obviously related, and both are pertinent and have been applied to the study of job performance over time.

Ackerman proposed a theory of skill acquisition, predicting that task performance becomes automatic through practice. His theory posits that the importance of certain abilities to task performance change during skill acquisition. Furthermore, this change depends on the particular ability and the nature of the task.
