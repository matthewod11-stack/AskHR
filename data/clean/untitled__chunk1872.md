# The Decline of Psychoanalysis

It is important to note that the inﬂuence of psychoanalysis within psychiatry in the United States far exceeded its inﬂu- ence in psychiatry in other countries. The combined member- ship of the psychoanalytic societies of Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland by 1961 amounted to only 250 people (Szasz, 1961). In these countries and Great Britain, the psychoana- lyst need not have had medical training, whereas in the

United States psychoanalysis became a medical specialty and also the predominant theoretical viewpoint of psychiatrists. Theories generally do not so much decline because of their inherent defects as because they have been replaced by better alternatives. Psychoanalysis declined as an inﬂuence in psy- chology for several reasons. One was the rise in psychophar- macology, another was the spread of behaviorist techniques, and a third was the increasingly evident defects of the theory itself.
