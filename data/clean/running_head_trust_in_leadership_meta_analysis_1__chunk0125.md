# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

that these two leadership styles are empirically distinct (see Cheng et al., 2004; Hiller et al.,

2019).

A critical distinction between paternalistic and transformational leadership is the

extent to which leaders are involved with the welfare of their followers. Transformational

leaders provide individualised care, but this is usually limited to the work context.

Paternalistic leaders, on the other hand, are theorised to also provide such care in their

followers’ work and personal lives (Chen et al., 2014). Further, the benevolence dimension of

paternalistic leadership was the strongest predictor compared to transformational leadership.

This finding is consistent with the recent work of Hiller and colleagues (2019) which

highlighted that the benevolence component is not being fully captured in other mainstream

leadership styles. Our finding that benevolent leadership is particularly important for trust is

in line with many theoretical works which place benevolence as a critical determinant of trust

(e.g., Mayer et al., 1995). Benevolence denotes care and concern and behaviours that signal

having the employee’s best interests at heart are likely to evoke employee gratitude and

indebtedness (Chen et al., 2014), thus helping to fuel social exchanges. As a relatively new

addition to leadership discourse, it is of value to see how paternalistic leadership configures

alongside other contemporary approaches. Also, given that paternalistic leadership has been

studied more in non-Western contexts, it is of interest in future work to address whether these

effects generalise to Western contexts.

Finally, it is interesting to note that all the leadership variables included in our analysis

are significantly correlated with trust in the leader. This finding can be interpreted in several

ways. One explanation is that all these leadership styles can influence follower trust. Some

leaders may, for example, create trust through providing autonomy (i.e., empowering

leadership), whereas others may do so by showing behavioural integrity (i.e., authentic

leadership). Alternatively, it could be argued that there is a large empirical overlap between
