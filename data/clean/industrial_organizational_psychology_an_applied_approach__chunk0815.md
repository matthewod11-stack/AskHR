## Does the Requirement Have Adverse Impact on Members of a Protected Class?

If the employment practice does not refer directly to a member of a protected class, the next step is to determine whether the requirement adversely affects members of a protected class. Adverse impact means that a particular employ- ment decision results in negative consequences more often for members of one race, sex, or national origin than for members of another race, sex, or national origin. For example, an employee-selection requirement of a college degree would lead to a lower percentage of African American applicants being hired compared with White applicants. Thus, even though such a requirement does not mention African Americans (a protected class), it does adversely impact them because according to  U.S. Census data, .% of Whites have bachelor’s degrees or higher compared with .% of African Americans. Though adverse impact anal- yses have traditionally been limited to groups protected by the  Civil Rights Act, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in  that employees could file adverse impact charges on the basis of age, which is protected under the ADEA (Roderick Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education, ).

The courts use two standards to determine adverse impact: statistical sig- nificance and practical significance. Both standards must be met for a finding of adverse impact. The statistical significance burden is met if a plaintiff can demonstrate that the differences in selection rates for two groups (e.g., men and women) would not have occurred by chance alone. Statistics used to make this determination include the standard deviation test, chi-square, and Fisher’s exact test.
