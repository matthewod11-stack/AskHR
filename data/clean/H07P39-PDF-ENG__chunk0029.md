# along the way.

. . .

The need for change is inevitable in any organization, but the approach

to driving change is a determinant of its success or failure, as Kathy, our passionate crusader, realized. Aﬀecting lasting change is not a solitary quest, but an inherently shared eﬀort. It requires embracing

a collaborative mindset that respects and includes diverse perspectives,

maintains a strategic focus, and patiently navigates the complexities

of organizational dynamics. It’s not about surrendering your passion

or advocacy but leveraging them in a more inclusive, strategic, and ultimately eﬀective way.
