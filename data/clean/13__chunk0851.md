condition liked their negotiation partner more, they did enjoy the task itself more. Carnevale and Isen (1986) focused more speciﬁcally on humor’s ability to induce positive affect. They followed up on research showing that mediators use humor to decrease hostility in interactions (Carnevale & Pegnetter, 1985) and that humor can decrease aggressiveness (Baron, 1984) by inducing positive affect in a laboratory experiment. They found that participants in the humor-induced positive affect condition used fewer contentious tactics during negotiations, and were more likely to engage in problem solving.

Another source of indirect evidence for a humor-cohesiveness relationship is research by Owren and Bachorowski (2003), which supports an evolutionary theory that links humor to cohesiveness through ‘‘hard-wired’’ human cognitive and emotional processes. Their empirical studies refute an older theory that laughter is meant to signal others that the laugher is in a positive mood. Rather, their research suggests that the evolved function of laughter is to trigger a positive mood state in others, which subsequently becomes associated with the individual doing the laughing. This ﬁnding dovetails nicely with Provine’s (1993) ﬁnding that in natural settings, speakers laughed 46% more than their audience, indicating that the humor producers might inﬂuence their audience in part by punctuating their communication with laughter. It is also consistent with the literature on emotional contagion cited above. Importantly, Owren and Bachorowski (2003) note that laughter will not spontaneously elicit positive mood in an audience that is in a negative or neutral mood state. In fact, they suggest that laughter has its most potent effect when the audience has a learned association between the laugher and previously experienced positive mood. This implies that among group members that have had positive experiences with one another, humor and laughter serve to reinforce social bonds (Fine & De Soucey, 2005).

The research that has been conducted on the link between humor and cohesiveness, as well as the related research cited above, strongly suggests that people are motivated to use humor to create cohesiveness, and that the positive emotional responses frequently elicited by humor might provide the glue. In addition, it appears that humor and laughter might have evolved speciﬁcally to engender cohesiveness. However, much of the research that has explored this issue in organizational contexts has used qualitative methods that are susceptible to experimenter expectancy or conﬁrmation bias effects. Therefore, a clear demonstration of a link between humor and
