## Coming Up Short on Nonfinancial Performance Measurement

sured total employee turnover, while others measured only voluntary turnover. Such in- consistencies make it hard for top manage- ment to assess overall progress or to compare one unit’s performance with another’s.

Sometimes the problem lies in the nature of the thing being measured. Most businesses have trouble discovering how they are doing at such elusive endeavors as developing leader- ship or maintaining supplier relations. Nearly half of all Balanced Scorecard users surveyed by Towers Perrin said they had difficulty quan- tifying qualitative results. One unfortunate re- sponse to these frustrations is to avoid measur- ing altogether the “hard to measure.” In fact, a Conference Board study found that for 55% of the senior executives it surveyed, the leading obstacle to implementing strategic-perfor- mance measurement systems was an unwill- ingness to measure activities that posed this problem. And many of the companies that did try to track more qualitative measures ignored them when making decisions. When we asked managers why they chose to overlook them, the typical response was lack of trust in mea- sures that were unproven and therefore sub- ject to favoritism and bias. Although such wariness saves companies from relying on mis- leading results, it also denies them a compre- hensive picture of their performance.

Doing It Right At the root of these four mistakes is the failure to discover which nonfinancial factors have

the most powerful effects on long-term eco- nomic performance. The root of the solution, therefore, is to base decision making on a well- established series of links. By following the steps listed below, companies should be able to realize the full promise of nonfinancial per- formance measures.

The first step is to develop a causal model based on the hypothe- ses in the strategic plan. Unfortunately, how- ever, many companies’ strategic plans are more like mission or vision statements than road maps. In the absence of strategic clarity and concrete detail, managers are prone to disagree about which performance areas are critical to success, and that can make consen- sus about the causal model difficult to reach. If that’s the case, it’s best to test a couple of different causal models. Once its merits have been proven, the model finally chosen will be hard to argue with and will be the source of broad-based agreement about strategy.

Develop a causal model.

Most companies al- ready track large numbers of nonfinancial measures in their day-to-day operations. So to avoid going to the trouble of collecting data that already exist, companies should take careful inventory of all their databases. This inventory should not limit itself to perfor- mance measurement systems but should ex- tend to any information systems (such as pur- chasing, manufacturing control, and customer service) that may contain useful data on key performance drivers.
