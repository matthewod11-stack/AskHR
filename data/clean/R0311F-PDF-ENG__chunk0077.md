# Our Research

This article is based on extensive field re- search into more than 60 manufacturing and service companies, where we interviewed se- nior and middle managers about their orga- nizational strategies and performance mea- surement systems. Since the data obtained from these companies are proprietary, we have kept company names confidential.

In 14 of the companies, we investigated the

extent to which nonfinancial performance measures that were chosen on the basis of their supposed ability to affect future finan- cial performance actually had the expected relationship. Executives at each of these com- panies gave us detailed descriptions of the fi- nancial and nonfinancial measures they be-

lieved to be the key drivers of their organization’s economic performance. We then statistically evaluated whether these drivers really affected their companies’ per- formance.

We supplemented our field research with

two surveys of performance measurement practices. The first survey, in which a market research firm obtained data from 157 chief fi- nancial officers and other senior executives in a broad range of industries, was con- ducted jointly by the Wharton School and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The aim of the sur- vey was to determine the types of perfor- mance measures these executives used, to what extent they tried to assess the relation-

ship between nonfinancial measures and fu- ture economic performance, and to what ex- tent they developed and adopted business models that established causal links between the company’s financial and nonfinancial measures.
