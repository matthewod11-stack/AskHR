## Rethinking Collaboration with AI for More Creative, Innovative Outcomes

Changing your mindset to more creatively and openly collaborate with

AI is about the willingness to explore the unknown and the capacity to

learn, unlearn, and experiment. Plus, it’s a lot of fun.

I often say that using AI delivers its best potential and results when I,

along with my cognitive biases, step aside. I ask myself, with a smile,

“WWAID?” or “What would AI do?” I acknowledge that my unconscious

manner of using gen AI tools might default to predictable inputs and

outputs. But by asking WWAID, I open myself up to new exchanges and

experiences, which can yield unexpected results.

Tapping into AI’s creative and transformative potential and training

your brain for an AI-ﬁrst world requires us to mindshift our prompting

style, engaging AI as a collaborative partner, rather than just a tool.
