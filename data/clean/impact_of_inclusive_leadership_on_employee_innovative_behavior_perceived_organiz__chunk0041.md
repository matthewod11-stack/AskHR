using 5,000 bootstrap samples in Mplus version 7.4 software [78]. Unstandardized coefficient estimates for the model were presented in Table 2. After controlling gender, age, education, and tenure, inclusive leadership was positively related to employee innovative behavior (β = 0.339��, SE = 0.081, p <0.01, 95%CI = [0.183, 0.503]). Because the CI did not contain zero. Thus, Hypothesis 1 was supported, indicating that when employees perceived more inclusive leadership, they demonstrated more innovative behavior. Inclusive leadership was positively related to POS (β = 0.843��, SE = 0.068, p <0.01, 95%CI = [0.710, 0.977]), supporting Hypoth- esis 2. This result indicated that when employees perceived more inclusive leadership, they experienced more POS. POS was positively related to employee innovative behavior (β = 0.244��, SE = 0.068, p <0.01, 95%CI = [0.112, 0.381]), supporting Hypothesis 3. This result demonstrated that when employees perceived more organizational support, they demon- strated more innovative behavior. Inclusive leadership was positively related to employee innovative behavior through POS (β = 0.206��, SE = 0.059, p <0.01, 95%CI = [0.092, 0.327]). The result indicated that POS mediated the relationship between inclusive leadership and employee innovative behavior.
