Wouldn’t it be wonderful if all employees loved their jobs so much that they

couldn’t wait to get to work and were so well suited and trained that their performances were outstanding? Well, this is the ultimate goal of indus- trial psychology. Unfortunately, not every employee will enjoy his or her job, and not every employee will do well on a job. In this book, you will learn the tech- niques developed by industrial/organizational (I/O) psychologists that show the way toward the goal of a happy and productive workforce.

Before we can talk about these techniques, several areas must be discussed so that you will have the basics to help you better understand the rest of the book. This chapter has two distinct sections. The first section provides a brief over- view of the field of I/O psychology, and the second section discusses the research methods that will be mentioned throughout the text.
