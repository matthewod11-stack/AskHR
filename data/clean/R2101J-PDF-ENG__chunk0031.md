## Twenty­six percent of the companies with formulaic plans

include at least one environmental, social, or governance (ESG) goal. In some cases targets are attached to those goals, and in others the goals are part of an assessment of strategic performance. Among the companies using ESG measures, 43% set human capital goals (such as diversity, employee engagement, and a positive company culture); 25% set health, safety, or environmental goals; and 32% use both types. Utilities and energy companies have the highest prev­ alence of ESG goals (81% and 77%, respectively), typically related to health, safety, and the environment.
