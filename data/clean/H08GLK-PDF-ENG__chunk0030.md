# stereotypes about speciﬁc groups.

To retain and empower your top talent, be mindful of feedback you give

and how it can reinforce negative stereotypes or biases.

Instead of: “Your peers ﬁnd you diﬃcult to work with.”

This feedback isn’t backed by examples, and it doesn’t connect the

employee’s behaviors to any outcome. It also doesn’t reﬂect any changes

you’re looking for. An employee who hears this feedback is not likely

to take it well, as it has no foundational evidence and may even be

perceived as biased.

Try: “I’ve noticed during our team discussions, you tend to quickly shut

down others’ ideas before fully understanding them. This makes your

peers feel dismissed and aﬀects their trust in your ability to collaborate.

Let’s work on fostering more open dialogue to make sure everyone’s

ideas are heard before we decide on the right approach. I’m here to help

you ﬁnd ways to improve this in our discussions.”

This feedback is constructive and focuses on the behavior you want to

see change, as well as examples of when it has occurred, and its impact. It doesn’t label the employee as “diﬃcult,” but rather, gives them an

action to improve upon.
