# CHAPTER 7

Toward an Understanding of the Multilevel Role of Personality in Teams Greg L. Stewart

Work organizations have increasingly adopted team structures; a recent survey suggests that as many as half of the Fortune 500 use teams in some part of their operation (Devine, Clayton, Philips, Dunford, & Melner, 1999). Although small group researchers have studied teams for decades, industrial/organizational (I/O) psy- chologists have only recently begun to examine how teams alter human resource practices.

One area of emerging research focuses on the role of person- ality in team contexts. This research originates from two perspec- tives. One examines how team settings create an environment that inï¬‚uences relationships between individual personality traits and individual performance (Mount, Barrick, & Stewart, 1998). The other examines how individual traits aggregate to form team-level personality, which in turn affects team and organizational perfor- mance (for example, Barrick, Stewart, Neubert, & Mount, 1998; Barry & Stewart, 1997). Personality can thus be studied in team set- tings at both the individual and team levels of analysis. In this chap- ter, I review research related to both levels, illustrate areas where additional research is needed, and develop a multilevel perspec- tive of personality in teams.
