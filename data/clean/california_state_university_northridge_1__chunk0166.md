1.5. "any clairns expressly excluded by law'' (Roads to Resolutior1, 1999).

What Roads to Resolution does is limits legal action against the company, which

could end up as a costly lawsuit for both sides. At the same time, should the company

have lost, the possibility exits that Prudential would have paid fees ranging from the low to

mid hundred thousand dollar mark, in addition to their attorney fees and research. It was

stated in the literature review a court case involved The Prudential Insurance Company of

America, where the company lost. Prior to the lawsuit, Prudential had mandatory

arbitration process; meanii,g court action could not be taken. If court action were taken,

it would be against company policy. An employee challenged this and the 9th Circuit

58

Court of Appeals ruled in 1994, that The Prudential Insurance Company of American

could not subject their employees to a mandatory arbitration process, which is denying

employees the ability to seek other available avenues. Courts do favor alternative dispute

resolution programs but not mandatory programs. In fairness, there are companies that

have such (mandatory arbitration) programs in place.
