While the methods fueling this growth of AI have been around for

decades, the cost of implementing them has dropped precipitously.

Previously the domain of data scientists only, modern AI-based solutions are now mature enough to be oﬀered “oﬀ the shelf,” greatly

driven by the wide availability of the cloud, the growth of low-cost

bandwidth, and reduced cost of sensors — have drastically lowered

the price of model-driven prediction. AI-based decisions can also be

included within the wider context of automation. Technologies such
