# Implications for practice

The social embeddedness of learning has increased and is recognized as naturally occurring in the workplace.

What role does social learning play in

human capital development, and what are the implications for human capital of adaptation during learning?

In what ways is social learning different

from other modes of learning in terms of what is learned and when and how learning transfers?

Organizations should acknowledge the importance of social learning in the workplace and consider how to best manage or facilitate it so that it contributes to human capital resource development aligned with strategic goals.

What types of knowledge and skills are learned most effectively in the various forms of social learning (social networks, OCoP, MOOC forums, etc.)?

Do learner characteristics such as self- efficacy and openness to experience influence the extent of learning that occurs from MOOCs, OCoP, and social networks?

Learning has become increasingly controlled by the learner and frequently occurs outside of a formal classroom, and its effectiveness depends on the active involvement of the learner.

Do individual differences explain

variations in the learning of individuals engaging in self-regulated learning or blended learning? Can self-regulation of learning strategies be cultivated? What role should the instructor have to maximize the effectiveness of blended learning? For example, do enthusiastic, participation-oriented instructors combined with meaningful and engaging online learning facilitate better learning outcomes?

Organizations should encourage learners to engage in self-regulation during online learning. Simulation games are most effective as a supplement to another instructional method. Effective simulation games actively engage the learner with the content and allow unlimited learner access.
