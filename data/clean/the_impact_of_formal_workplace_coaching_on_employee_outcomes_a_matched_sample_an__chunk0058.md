In the initial sample (n = 601), the group sizes were unequal (coached n = 206; no- coached n = 395) and showed statistically significant differences (p≤.05) in age, tenure, and level of education. After PSM, the matched sample contained an equal number of cases (n = 206 per group) and showed no statistical differences in age, gender, tenure, or level of education. This result mimics random group assignment (Hammack-Brown et al., 2024) and ensures that between-group differences are likely due to the coaching status rather than age, gender, tenure, or level of education.
