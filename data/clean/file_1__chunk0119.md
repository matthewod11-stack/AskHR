Individuals with low pay expectations have a tendency to believe that less pay is a reasonable pay, not only for themselves, but also for others (Jackson and Grabski, 1988). In this case, individuals with low pay expectations are expected to build their pay expectations for others based on the knowledge of other individuals with similar pay. Individuals with low pay expectations are thus expected to be less likely to consider somebody's salary to be unreasonable when they learn about this person's salary. Accordingly, individuals with low expectations are proposed to perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than individuals with high pay expectations.

Perceived pay fairness: perceived pay fairness is a function of the difference between an estimated pay level and what an individual thinks his/her pay should be (Heneman, 1985). According to equity theory (Adam, 1965), there are general differences in the importance individuals attach to pay fairness. According to the theory, individuals, who perceive themselves as under-rewarded, experience distress and inequity. The greater the inequity, the more distress individuals feel and the more they attach attention towards pay injustice (Walster, Traupmann and Walster, 1978). In fact, individuals who perceive less pay fairness than others may be less satisfied with their work in general, and, as a result, they might perceive the gender pay gap to a greater extent than individuals who perceive more pay fairness. Accordingly, perceived pay fairness is expected to influence individualsâ€™ perceptions of the gender pay gap so that the more an individual perceives pay fairness, the less he/she is concerned about pay inequalities, and the less he/she perceives the gender pay gap.
