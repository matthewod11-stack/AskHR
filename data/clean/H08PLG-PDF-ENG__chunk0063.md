Companies can beneﬁt from the AI industry becoming more

competitive and in the growth of specialized AI applications tailored to

diﬀerent needs. These could include “small” AI companies and models

that target much needed interventions in low productivity sectors in

the developing world, such as agriculture or education, and unlock a

disproportionate amount of value by solving for an unmet need.

These developments must also address AI’s trust problem, however.

While open-source AI facilitates competitiveness, it can also introduce

new security vulnerabilities. Trust-building investments that also keep

high-performing AI accessible will be key marketplace diﬀerentiators;

companies can consider tools, such as Dependabot, Renovate, or Snyk

to check open-source models for known security vulnerabilities.
