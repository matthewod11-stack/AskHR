# INTRODUCTION

Previous studies on organizational justice have come to somewhat inconsistent conclusions regarding gender differences in the effect of equity (e.g., Graham and Welbourne, 1999) and organizational justice (e.g., Lee and Farh, 1999; Major and Adams, 1983; Major and Deaux, 1982; Sweeney and McFarlin, 1997) on organizational commitment. In this paper, we aim at contributing to these debates by integrating social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) and the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999) into analysis of gender differences in individual responses to organizational injustice.

As indicated by Adam’s equity theory (1965), employees compare their own ratio of perceived outcomes (e.g., salary) to perceived inputs (e.g., effort, performance). As a result of these comparisons, they may feel under-, over- or fairly rewarded. Individuals who perceive to be under-rewarded (i.e., pay inequity), experience negative emotional reactions, such as job dissatisfaction, distress (Fields, Pang and Chiu, 2000), reduced well-being and respect for their jobs (Tepper, 2001), and emotional exhaustion (van Dierendonck, Schaufeli and Buunk, 2001). In addition, pay inequity can result in feelings of anger, powerlessness, decreased satisfaction with various facets of the job, increased intentions to quit the job, and decreased organizational commitment (Huseman, Hatfield and Miles, 1987; Stone-Romero and Stone, 2005).

Individuals’ perceptions of justice may also guide a range of their key attitudes and behaviours (Lee and Farh, 1999). According to procedural justice theory (Thibaut and Walker, 1975), perceptions of procedural justice reinforce feelings of self-esteem, improve control over the outcome allocations, and signal a respect for morality (cf. de Cremer and Tyler, 2005). Empirical evidence has demonstrated that perceptions of procedural justice are associated with organizational system evaluations such as organizational commitment (Greenberg, 1990; Korsgaard, Schweiger and Sapienza,
