# Personality Inventories

Personality inventories are becoming increasingly popular as an employee selection method, in part because they predict performance better than was once thought, and in part because they result in less adverse impact than do abil- ity tests. Personality inventories fall into one of two categories based on their intended purpose: measurement of types of normal personality or measurement of psychopathology (abnormal personality).

Tests of Normal Personality Tests of normal personality measure the traits exhibited by normal individuals in everyday life. Examples of such traits are extraversion, shyness, assertiveness, and friendliness.

Determination of the number and type of personality dimensions measured by an inventory can usually be () based on a theory, () statistically based, or () empirically based. The number of dimensions in a theory-based test is identical to the number postulated by a well-known theorist. For example, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has four scales and is based on the personality theory of Carl Jung, whereas the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule, with  dimensions, is based on a theory by Henry Murray. The number of dimensions in a statistically based test is determined through a statistical process called factor analysis. The most well-known test of this type, the PF (Personality Factor), was created by Raymond Cattell and, as its name implies, contains  dimensions. The number and location of dimensions under which items fall in an empirically based test is determined by grouping answers given by people known to possess a certain char- acteristic. For example, in developing the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality

Inventory (MMPI), hundreds of items were administered to groups of psycholog- ically healthy people and to people known to have certain psychological problems such as paranoia. Items that were endorsed more often by paranoid patients than healthy individuals were keyed under the paranoia dimension of the MMPI.

Although there are hundreds of personality inventories that measure hundreds of traits, there is general agreement that most personality traits can be placed into one of five main personality dimensions. Popularly known as the “Big Five” or the five-factor model, these dimensions are:

openness to experience (bright, inquisitive), conscientiousness (reliable, dependable), extraversion (outgoing, friendly), agreeableness (works well with others, a team player), and emotional stability (not anxious, tense).

Examples of common measures of normal personality used in employee selection include the Hogan Personality Inventory, the California Psychological Inventory, the NEO-PI (Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Personality Inven- tory), and the PF.

That objective personality inventories are useful in predicting performance in the United States and Europe is indicated in meta-analyses by Tett, Jackson, and Rothstein (), Barrick and Mount (), Tett, Jackson, Rothstein, and Reddon (), Salgado (), and Hurtz and Donovan (). Though there is some disagreement across the various meta-analyses, probably the best interpretation is that personality can predict performance at low but statistically significant levels, conscientiousness is the best predictor in most occupations and for most criteria, and the validity of the other four personality dimensions is dependent on the type of job and criterion for which the test is being validated.

For example, a meta-analysis of predictors of police performance found that openness was the best personality predictor of academy performance; conscientiousness was the best predictor of supervisor ratings of performance; and emotional stability was the best predictor of disciplinary problems (Aamodt, ). In contrast, a meta-analysis of predictors of sales performance found that conscien- tiousness was the best predictor of both supervisor ratings and actual sales perfor- mance (Vinchur, Schippmann, Switzer, & Roth, ).

One of the concerns about using personality inventories for employee selec- tion is that, because they are self-reports, they are relatively easy to fake. Research indicates that applicants can fake personality inventories, but do so less often than thought. When they do fake, it has minimal effect on the validity of the test results (Morgeson et al., ).

Though personality inventories aren’t the best predictors of employee perfor- mance, they are useful in training and development programs in which employees and managers attempt to get insight into the ways in which they have related to others. In such contexts, personality inventories such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator are commonly used. It is important to understand that the personality inventories used in training and self-development programs were not designed for employee selection and should never be used for that purpose.

Tests of Psychopathology Tests of psychopathology (abnormal behavior) determine whether individuals have serious psychological problems such as depression, bipolar disorder, and

schizophrenia. Though used extensively by clinical psychologists, these tests are seldom used by industrial-organizational (I/O) psychologists except in the selec- tion of law enforcement officers. Because the courts consider tests of psychopa- thology to be “medical exams,” they can be administered only after a conditional offer of employment has been made to an applicant.

Tests of psychopathology are generally scored in one of two ways: objec- tively or projectively. Projective tests provide the respondent with unstructured tasks such as describing ink blots and drawing pictures. Because projective tests are of questionable reliability and validity (Lilienfeld, Wood, & Garb, ) and are time-consuming and expensive, they are rarely used in employee selection. Common tests in this category also include the Rorschach Ink Blot Test and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).

Objective tests are structured so that the respondent is limited to a few answers that will be scored by standardized keys. By far the most popular and heavily studied test of this type is the MMPI-. Other tests in this category are the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-III) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).
