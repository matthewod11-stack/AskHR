## Theories of Individual Differences in Job Performance

According to Campbell (1990; Campbell et al., 1993), performance is a function of three determinants: declarative knowledge, proce- dural knowledge and skill, and motivation. Declarative knowledge represents factual knowledge about speciﬁc things, or knowing what to do. Procedural knowledge and skill is the degree to which one is able to perform a task. This is achieved when knowing what to do is combined with knowing how to do it. Campbell et al. deﬁne mo- tivation as the combined effect of the choice to expend effort in a particular direction, the choice of the level of effort to expend, and the choice to persist at that level of effort. Performance on a job di- mension is determined directly by some combination of these three determinants. The direct performance determinants are distin- guished from indirect performance determinants, which can in- ﬂuence performance only by the direct determinants. Examples of indirect determinants provided by the organization include re- ward systems, training, and management practices. Personality is an example of an indirect determinant that the individual brings to the organization, along with abilities, interests, education, and experience.

This model has clear implications for the relationship between personality and performance on a particular performance di- mension. Personality can inﬂuence performance only through its inﬂuence on declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and skill, or motivation. This means that one way a personality variable may be related to performance on a dimension is if people higher on that variable tend to acquire more of the declarative or proce- dural knowledge necessary for performance on that dimension (McCloy, Campbell, & Cudeck, 1994). Many personality variables
