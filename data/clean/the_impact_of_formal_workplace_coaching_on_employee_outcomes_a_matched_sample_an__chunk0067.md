# Implications for research

To advance HRD research, we have responded to the call by Keiffer and Lane (2016) by adopting best practice methods when comparing non-randomly assigned groups on work-related outcomes. Whilst random sampling remains the gold standard for gener- alisability (Bell et al., 2019), a significant strength of our quasi-experimental design is the application of PSM to transform our non-random initial sample into two equally sized groups, matched on age, gender, tenure, and level of education. As a result, our matched sample of n = 412 mimicked random group assignment (Hammack-Brown et al., 2024), minimising sampling bias and enhancing confidence in the generalisability of the find- ings. Although non-random sampling is common in organisational research (Pousa & Mathieu, 2015), researchers can still take steps to reduce sampling bias, and we advocate PSM as a method for achieving this.

Another strength of our study is that we adopted latent means modelling when comparing the difference between our groups. Because we modelled our outcome vari- ables as latent constructs, it made sense to compare latent mean difference rather than take a summed average approach (M체ller & Sch채fer, 2017). We found just one other workplace coaching study among the literature where latent means were compared (see Hammack-Brown et al., 2024). This suggests the use of structured means modelling is underutilised, and we recommend HRD researchers consider this method when compar- ing groups measured with latent variables because it can produce more precise and reliable results (M체ller & Sch채fer, 2017).
