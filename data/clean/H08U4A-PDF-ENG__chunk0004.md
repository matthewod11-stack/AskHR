ness Isn’t a Nice to Have

where their performance, goals, and direction are discussed. Each

physician is required to set a personal improvement goal for the year

ahead; some might want to learn a new technique, improve their

communication skills, or get better at teaching. Feedback ﬂows both

ways, and people are asked to reﬂect on what’s working, what’s not, and

what support they might need. That kind of structure sets the tone. It

builds a culture of trust, clarity, and shared responsibility. It is a way

of hardwiring kindness into the organization in the sense that people

are given time, attention, and respect. That signals to people that they

matter, and that the organization is invested in their success.

# A Management Discipline

Beyond senior leaders, kindness should become part of everyday

management throughout the organization. All managers must

understand it’s not optional. They should treat it as part of the job, and

they should be held accountable for doing so.

Ultimately, managers are responsible for how their teams perform

and collaborate across the organization. In a study of 51 work teams

at a manufacturing company published in 1999, one of us (Amy

Edmondson) and her team found that psychological safety was the

single most important factor in team performance—measured by two

surveys: of the teams, who were asked to assess their own performance,

and of the recipients of the teams’ work (either a manager or a

downstream internal customer), who were asked to rate it. This ﬁnding

was echoed by Project Aristotle, a Google initiative that explored what

made that company’s 180 teams eﬀective or not: It found that the

highest-performing teams—in terms of metrics related to productivity,

achieving deadlines, and work quality—had exceptional levels of

psychological safety. All team members were aﬀorded opportunities

to speak and share ideas and demonstrated that they cared for and

supported one another.

## HBR / Digital Article / Why Kindness Isn’t a Nice to Have

This is what happens when kindness is built into reliable, high-

functioning systems led by managers who understand it’s not optional.

They use clear tactics for embedding kindness as a strategic priority: It’s

expected, measured, and reinforced at every level. Key management

levers for making kindness an organization-wide norm include the

# following:

- 1. Treat kindness as a hard skill.

Organizations can be clear about what kindness looks like in action

and can teach it. That includes skills like how to listen without

defensiveness, give and receive feedback, and handle conﬂict or hard

# conversations with care.

At Google, managers are trained and expected to actively create and

## support psychologically safe environments for their teams. Employee

surveys and feedback are used to gauge how team-level behaviors are

being inﬂuenced by their managers (such as how feedback is given

and received and how challenges and uncertainty are expressed and

managed). This data is integrated into each manager’s performance

review, highlighting and rewarding positive behaviors and reinforcing

accountability. Framing kindness as a professional capability reinforces

that it is a critical skill linked to success within the organization and not

# just a nice-to-have trait.

SAP, known for its inclusive workplace practices and neurodiverse

hiring, runs the Autism at Work program to teach managers how

to support psychological safety and kindness in action. They receive

training to develop skills to manage conﬂict, communicate in a clear

and kind fashion, and promote inclusive team behavior. This program
