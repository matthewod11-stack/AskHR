# Acknowledgments

We express our sincere appreciation to all those who have con- tributed to the realization of this book. Most important, we thank the chapter authors. We were extraordinarily fortunate to have a number of highly inﬂuential researchers in the ﬁeld with a wide range of expertise and interests willing to enlist in this effort. We were delighted with their contributions. We are also greatly in- debted to Marcy Schaefer for her valuable assistance in preparing the manuscript for publication. We extend our thanks to Neal Schmitt, the Organizational Frontiers Series editor, and the entire Frontiers editorial board for comments and suggestions on our proposal for this book. Finally, we thank our families—Sarah, Courtney, and Jennifer; Brian, Marilyn, and Clare—for their con- tinuing support and encouragement throughout this project.
