# The empirically-driven approach to behavioral economics combines two practices: (i) Explicitly

modeling limits on rationality, willpower and self-interest; and (ii) using established facts to suggest

assumptions about those limits. A different, “mindless”, approach (Gul and Pesendorfer, 2005) follows

elements of practice (i) but not (ii), modeling limits but enthusiastically ignoring empirical details of

psychology. The argument for the mindless approach is Friedmanesque: Since theories that infer utility from

observed choices were not originally intended to be tested by any data other than choices1, evidence about

assumptions does not count.

But theories are not copyrighted. So neuroscientists, for example, are free to assume that utilities

actually are numbers which correspond to the magnitude of some process in the brain (e.g., neural firing rates)

and search for utilities using neuroscientific methods (knowing full well their results will be ignored by

“mindless”-type economists). Such a search doesn’t ‘misunderstand economics’, it just takes the liberty of

defining economic variables as neural constructs. The hope is also that new neural constructs will be discovered

that are most gracefully accommodated only if the standard language of preference, belief and constraint is

stretched by some new vocabulary.

Before proceeding, let me clarify two points. First, the discussion above should make clear that

behavioral economics is not a distinct subfield of economics. It is a style of modeling, or a school of thought,

which is meant to apply to a wide range of economic questions in consumer theory, finance, labor economics

and so on. Second, while the psychological data that fueled many developments in behavioral economics are

largely experimental, behavioral economics is an approach and experimental economics is a method. It is true

that early in modern behavioral economics, experiments proved to be useful as a way of establishing that

anomalies were not produced by factors that are hard to rule out in field data-- transaction costs, risk-aversion,

confusion, self-selection, etc.— but are easy to rule out with good experimental control. But the main point of

these experiments was just to suggest regularities that could be included in models to make predictions about
