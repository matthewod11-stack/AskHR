work are paid fairly, regardless of their gender, race/ethnicity, orother protected class factors. In other words, equal pay for equalwork.“[E]quitable and fair pay is among the greatest drivers ofemployee satisfaction,” human resources research analyst andauthor Josh Bersin said in his

HR Predictions for 2022 report. “[I]fyou want to win the war for talent in 2022, fair pay may be one ofyour biggest techniques.”But pay equity is more than just a competitive tool in a red-hotlabor market. It’s an opportunity to foster innovation, driveemployee engagement, minimize turnover, maintain (or improve)brand reputation, and attract investors.In fact, a study conducted by job recruiting site

Indeed finds that81% of workers are more productive and engaged when theyperceive themselves as paid fairly. Moreover, that same reportsays 75% of employees are more likely to apply for a job when thecompany is known for pay transparency.With so much to gain from making pay equity a priority,employers who merely pay lip service or treat it as a one-off do soat their own risk. Employers that fail to effectively address payinequity open themselves to public backlash and legal action, allat the peril of the bottom line. This is especially true with moreand more

pay equity-related laws being enacted across the U.S.and abroad.
