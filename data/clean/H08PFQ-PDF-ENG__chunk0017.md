## strengthens decision-making, so create space for diverse perspectives

in order to avoid echo chambers, ideological “camps,” and groupthink.

Teams that normalize disagreement and curiosity signal emotional

maturity and openness—two characteristics others often interpret as

strength. Without this safety, individuals retreat into silence or passive

resistance, which erodes trust faster than disagreement ever could.

Another reader of our previous article suggested their executive team

didn’t have the level of trust “to call each other out.” They asked: “How

do we make it safe enough to normalize saying the tough things?”

The assumption behind the question seems to be that this is an

“orientation” issue—that saying hard things requires a level of comfort

and familiarity. But that’s not true. It’s not supposed to be comfortable,

but it does require skills many leadership teams lack.

My advice to them? Practice. Like any skill, you have to go to the

“executive team conﬂict gym” and work out until the muscles you need are strong enough to withstand whatever diﬀerences come your way.

To cultivate psychological safety:

- Dedicate regular team time (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to “conﬂict

practice” sessions, deliberately exploring tough issues to normalize
