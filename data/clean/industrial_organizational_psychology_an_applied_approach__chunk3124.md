# Agrees to everything

Being liked

Won’t commit or make a decision

Being appreciated Throws tantrums

Talk honestly and let the person know it is safe to disagree with you. Help them learn a decision-making system, and then reassure them about the decisions they make. Don’t show anger, acknowledge their complaint, and give them a chance to cool down.
