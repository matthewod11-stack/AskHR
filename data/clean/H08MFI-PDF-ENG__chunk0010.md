The reason why we need to talk about professional heartbreak is that

it’s very painful and real, and yet often this heartbreak isn’t given the

weight it needs. Many of us pour our heart and soul into our career. But

when you go through professional heartbreak, even the people you love

the most might just tell you to get over it. “A job will never love you

back,” they say. Yes, obviously. But that’s not realistic either, because for

many highly skilled professionals and people who have built businesses

or do work that is very meaningful to them, their identity is deeply

intertwined with their professional self. Not to mention, many of us

have deep relationships with our colleagues. Having friends at work

makes us feel good. There’s community, belonging, rewards. And so

when we say “it’s just a job,” we’re denying very real feelings, which can

only exacerbate the heartbreak.
