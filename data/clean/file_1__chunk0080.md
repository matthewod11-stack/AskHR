discourse analysis. It views gender equality as an object for empirical analysis with a focus on its construction and operationalization in specified contexts (Holli, 2003). It investigates how different terminology, languages, discourses of gender equality influence its concept.

The last approach, socio-empirical approach, analyses gender equality in social reality in relation to the norm (Holli, 2003). It concentrates on the degree of achievement of gender equality in different countries, during different periods of time, or at different hierarchical levels of the society. Since policymakers need not only statistics about gender equality but also in-depth analysis of the social conditions that impact the promotion of gender equality, the socio-empirical approach has become increasingly popular (Holli, 2003). By means of the socio-empirical approach in this thesis, I intend to analyze whether and to what extent, gender inequality and the gender pay gap are perceived to exist among individuals and employees in the Finnish society in general and in various Finnish organizations in particular.
