Finally, flexible hours are those that remain in the bandwidth and in which the employee has a choice of working. For example, if the bandwidth is the -hour period from  a.m. to  p.m. and the core hours are from  a.m. to  a.m., then the employee can schedule the remaining six hours (including lunch hour) anywhere from  a.m. to  a.m. and from  p.m. to  p.m. The actual degree to which these hours are truly flexible depends on the specific flextime program used by the organization.

The most flexible of these schedules is called gliding time. With this system, an employee can choose her own hours without advance notice or scheduling. Employees can come and go as they please as long as they work eight hours each day and  hours each week. With gliding time, there are no core hours. For example, at W Public Relations in New York, employees can work their hours anytime between : a.m. and : p.m. Such a flexible schedule, however, will work only where it is not necessary to always have an employee working, as in typing or accounting. In an organization such as a retail store or a restau- rant, such a system would mean that at any given time there might not be any employee present—which, of course, is probably not the best way to conduct these types of businesses.

Most flexible working schedules are categorized as flexitour or modi- fied flexitour, with the employee enjoying greater flexibility in working hours, although the hours must be scheduled in advance. With a flexitour system, the employee must submit a schedule on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis, depending on the organization. In a modified flexitour, the employee must sched- ule her hours in advance but can change these hours on a daily basis with some advance notice.

Flexible working schedules are popular with employees and beneficial to organizations. Many employees opt to start work earlier in the day and come home earlier so that they can beat traffic and spend more time with their chil- dren. As shown in Tables . and ., meta-analyses by Estes () and Baltes et al. () found that flextime resulted in less absenteeism, less overtime, higher job satisfaction, less role conflict, and increased productivity. These effects were
