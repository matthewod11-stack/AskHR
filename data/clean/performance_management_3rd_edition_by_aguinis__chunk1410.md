## 2020 Insight Gold www.2020insight.net (demo available online)

20/20 Insight GOLD is extremely user-friendly software that lets you create and use practically any kind of multisource feedback survey you can imagine—including 360-degree feedback projects, pre- and post-training competency surveys, team and organization climate surveys, customer satisfaction surveys, and many more.

As an illustration, consider the system offered by CheckPoint (http://ourworld. compuserve.com/homepages/gately/chkpoint.htm). This system, designed for employees in supervisory roles, includes information on the following competencies:

- Communication (listens to others, processes information, communicates effectively) • Leadership (instills trust, provides direction, delegates responsibility) • Adaptability (adjusts to circumstances, thinks creatively)
