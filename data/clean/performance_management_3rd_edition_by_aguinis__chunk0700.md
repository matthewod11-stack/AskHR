# Part II • System Implementation

- 9. Flexible. Good objectives are not immutable. They can and likely will change based on changes in the work or business environments.

- 10. Limited in number. Too many objectives may become impossible to achieve, but too few may not make a sufficient contribution to the organization. Objectives must be limited in number. Between 5 and 10 objectives per review period is a manageable number, but this can change based on the position and organization in question.

Several organizations set goals following these guidelines. For example, Microsoft Corporation has a long history of using individual goals in its performance manage- ment system. The goals at Microsoft are described by the acronym SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, results-based, and time-specific.6

Table 5.1 summarizes the characteristics of good objectives. Using this list as our guide, let’s return to the position Training Specialist/Consultant—Leadership & Team Development at Target Corporation.

Examples of objectives (one or two per accountability) are the following:

- Process leadership. Develop leadership development processes and training programs within budget and time commitments. Meet budget targets and improve executive leaders’ “leadership readiness” scores across organization by 20% in the coming fiscal year.

- Supervision of nonexempt staff. Receive acceptable managerial effectiveness rating scores from your nonexempt staff in the coming fiscal year.

- Coaching.

Improve the managerial effectiveness scores of executive coaching

clients in the coming fiscal year.

- Team-building consultation. Deliver necessary team-training sessions throughout the year within budget and with an acceptable satisfaction rating (as measured by the follow-up survey that is sent to every team) for team-training sessions in the coming fiscal year.

- Assessment instrument feedback. Deliver assessment feedback with an acceptable approval rating from your coaching clients in the coming fiscal year.

- Product improvement.

Improve satisfaction with training delivery in the coming

fiscal year by receiving acceptable scores while staying on budget.

Do these objectives comply with each of the 10 characteristics of good objectives

listed in Table 5.1?
