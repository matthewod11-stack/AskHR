facts of human color vision, could deduce the physiological processes in the eye and brain.

An interesting chapter in the development of color-vision theory is the work of Christine Ladd-Franklin (Hilgard, 1987). She completed her PhD in mathematics at Johns Hopkins in 1882 but was not awarded the degree because she was a woman. Later she spent a year in Müller’s laboratory in Göttingen, where he gave her private lectures because, as a woman, she was not allowed to attend his regular lectures. She developed a most interesting evolutionary theory of color vision based on the color zones in the retina. The center of the fovia has all colors and the most detailed vision. The next outer zone has red and green sensitivity (as well as blue and yellow), the next outer zone to this has only blue and yel- low sensitivity (and black-white), and the most peripheral regions have only black-white (achromatic) sensitivity.

She argued that in evolution, the achromatic sensitivity (rods) developed ﬁrst, followed by evolution of blue and yel- low receptors and ﬁnally red and green receptors. The fact that red-green color blindness is most common is consistent with the idea that it is the most recent to evolve and hence the most “fragile.”

Modern molecular biology and genetics actually provide support for Ladd-Franklin’s evolutionary hypothesis. The Old World monkey retina appears to be identical to the human retina: Both macaques and humans have rods and three types of cones. It is now thought that the genes for the cone pigments and rhodopsin evolved from a common ances- tral gene. Analysis of the amino acid sequences in the differ- ent opsins suggest that the ﬁrst color pigment molecule was sensitive to blue. It then gave rise to another pigment that in turn diverged to form red and green pigments. Unlike Old World monkeys, New World monkeys have only two cone pigments, a blue and a longer wavelength pigment thought to be ancestral to the red and green pigments of humans and other Old World primates. The evolution of the red and green pigments must have occurred after the continents separated, about 130 million years ago. The New World monkey retina, with only two color pigments, provides a perfect model for human red-green color blindness. Genetic analysis of the var- ious forms of human color blindness, incidentally, suggests that some humans may someday, millions of years from now, have four cone pigments rather than three and see the world in very different colors than we do now.

The modern ﬁeld of vision, encompassing psychophysics, physiology, anatomy, chemistry, and genetics, is one of the great success stories of neuroscience and biological psychol- ogy. We now know that there are more than 30 different visual areas in the cerebral cortex of monkeys and humans,

showing degrees of selectivity of response to the various attributes of visual experience, for example, a “color” area, a “movement” area, and so on. We now have a very good un- derstanding of phenomena of visual sensation and perception (see the chapter by Coren in this volume). The ﬁeld con- cerned with vision has become an entirely separate ﬁeld of human endeavor, with its own journals, societies, specialized technologies, and NIH institute.
