### **[New leadership competencies for the AI age]{.underline}**

[These shifts demand new leadership capabilities. There are the five
meta-capabilities that will be important for leaders to become a new
type of leader in the age of AI:]{.underline}

1. [The sense-maker: In a world of infinite information and
 > AI-generated insights, the scarcest resource is meaning. Leaders
 > must now synthesize insights across human and artificial
 > intelligence, create coherent narratives from chaos, help teams
 > find meaning amidst acceleration, and build shared understanding
 > when reality shifts daily. This isn\'t about having the answers
 > --- it\'s about making sense of the questions through critical
 > thinking and analysis. It\'s about helping humans understand not
 > just what\'s happening, but what it means for them, their work,
 > their future. The ability to think critically about AI\'s outputs,
 > to question its assumptions, and to identify what\'s missing
 > becomes essential.]{.underline}

2. [The Human-AI culture architect: Culture used to evolve slowly. And
 > it used to just be about humans. Now it must be actively designed
 > for human-AI collaboration. This means preserving human connection
 > in digital environments, creating psychological safety during
 > existential shifts, building identity beyond job functions, and
 > fostering belonging when work itself transforms. You\'re not
 > managing culture---you\'re architecting it for a hybrid future
 > where humans and AI work together in ways we\'re just beginning to
 > imagine.]{.underline}

3. [The paradox navigator: The AI age is full of contradictions that
 > can\'t be resolved, only navigated. Be efficient *and* human. Move
 > fast *and* be thoughtful. Embrace AI *and* preserve human agency.
 > Automate *and* create meaningful work. Scale *and* personalize.
 > Leaders must become comfortable holding multiple truths
 > simultaneously, making decisions when both options are right,
 > leading through *and* not *or*.]{.underline}

4. [The learning orchestrator: When knowledge has an expiration date
 > measured in months, learning becomes the core capability. But this
 > isn\'t traditional learning. It\'s about unlearning faster than
 > learning --- letting go of what made you successful. It\'s
 > meta-learning --- learning how to learn in new ways. It\'s
 > collective learning --- building organizational intelligence.
 > It\'s experimental learning --- discovering through doing. And
 > crucially, it\'s about developing critical thinking skills across
 > the organization, ensuring everyone can evaluate and challenge
 > both human and AI-generated insights. You\'re not just learning
 > yourself --- you\'re orchestrating learning at scale, creating
 > organizations that evolve as fast as the technology around
 > them.]{.underline}

5. [The ethical anchor: When AI systems can tell you what you can do,
 > leaders must decide what you should do. This requires making
 > values-based decisions when AI provides the data, protecting human
 > dignity in efficiency-driven systems, defining ethical boundaries
 > for AI use, and leading through moral complexity without clear
 > precedents. Most importantly, it demands rigorous critical
 > thinking --- the ability to question AI\'s recommendations,
 > identify hidden biases, and understand the broader implications of
 > automated decisions. In a world of artificial intelligence, human
 > wisdom and critical thinking become the ultimate
 > differentiators.]{.underline}
