# and environmental priorities.

First, they speak out on these issues as a form of stealth public relations

— they project their ambition along a huge range of topics in an eﬀort

to appease stakeholders in the short term. Making a public statement is

often a way to compensate for, or distract from, a lack of meaningful

action, and it is increasingly the norm. For instance, the Carbon

Disclosure Project recently reviewed 4,100 corporate commitments on

climate change and found that fewer than 100 were credible.

Second, organizations are reluctant to set tight priorities. So they end

up with a laundry list of goals and aspirations that fails to distinguish

among risks, opportunities, and negative impacts that require ethical

guardrails. When corporations suggest that they can address every

relevant issue, they overpromise and underdeliver, fueling impatience

and diminishing trust.
