- Basis for the development of a human resources management system (including reasonable recruitment of o(cid:4232)cials, remuneration system development)

- Reasonable employee assessment

Source: Author’s own processing based on the literature review

There is numerous research in which entrepreneurial and management competencies were studied (Shum, Gatling and Shoemaker, 2018; Muizu and Yudomartono, 2016; Bendassolli et al., 2016; Boyatzis, 1982; Blayney, 2009). Greater attention is paid to management competencies since the quality of the management’s work has a strong impact on the company’s success. These competencies include techn ical skills, conceptual skills and human skills that support business development and management (Muiz and Hilmiana, 2016). Man (2001) defined six dimensions of entrepreneurial competency, including strategy, opportunity, relati onships, conceptual, organisation and commitment. The importance of entrepreneurial competency is confirmed by empirical evidence. The major internal setback to entrepreneurship results from the emotional aspects

(fear of responsibility, fear of risks and stress, lack of self-confidence), relationship aspects (lack of social networks), and the lack of significant leadership competency. Entrepreneurial traits are persistence, the ability to overcome problems and limited risk-taking as well as the ability to innovate and build social networks (Bendassolli et al., 2016).

Nevertheless, competencies must vary depending on the company’s industry, and not all of the industries can boast of having a range of extensively researched competencies. For instance, in the context of creative industries and given the peculiarities of this context, studies on entrepreneurial competency and entrepreneurial personality are still limited (Bendassolli et al., 2016). At the same time, creative and entrepreneurial competencies are an essential precondition for the facilitation of competition and/or co-operation (Loots, Cnossen and Witteloostuijn, 2018). Improved quality and competency result in a significant improvement in productivity and the ability to produce competitive creative products. This is important since investments in human capital are not small, but results can often only be seen in the foreseeable future. And yet, literature provides several combinations of competency model research that facilitate the attempt to find the list of cognitive, emotional, moral and social competencies that would be better aligned with creative industries and help understand the factors most directly related to the successful performance of entrepreneurs in this work (Bendassolli et al., 2016).

In general, competency models are an effective tool for improving employee performance both in the public and private sectors. They are particularly important in the recruitment and training process; the development of competency models also contributes to sound decision-making.

- 3. Results The literature studied has undeniably demonstrated that the use of the competency-based approach in academic and business sectors improves the results achieved. Therefore, the author of the research proposes the following hypothesis, which will be tested by an empirical study: H1: The use of competency models in the development and implementation of training

programmes has a positive impact on learners’ outcomes and their attitude.

The literature review has shown that there are both general and specific competency erformers and also provides models. Their development helps find suitable job p the possibility to distinguish between a potentially average performer and a performer whose performance will be higher than the average. However, regardless of the fact that general competency models are personnel selection and development of training programmes, they cannot be fully applied i n each field. They need to be adapted depending on the activity type and company size. Based on this, the following hypothesis is raised:
