## detrimental to your mental health as a person of color. In these

situations, you must determine if it’s in your best interest to leave.

Making this decision with a therapist can help reduce the anxiety and

fear that may arise. A therapist will help you evaluate the pros and cons

of leaving, develop an exit strategy, and think through steps to take for

your future, including what to look for in your next company.

If you do leave, the company may require you to participate in an exit

interview. When asked about your reasons for leaving, try as best as you

can to remain unemotional (as difﬁcult as that may be) and stick to the

facts. Sadly, and unfairly, it is easier for the interviewer to dismiss your

experiences or suggestions if you are seen as overly emotional.
