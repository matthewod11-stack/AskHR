# Academic Societies

No one academic society has emerged as the primary home for comparative psychologists. The APA remains the leading organization of psychologists, but its Division of Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology (Division 6) is but a small part of the APA. Some psychologists have given allegiance to other psychological organizations such as the Psychonomic Society or theAmerican Psychological Society. TheAnimal Behavior Society in NorthAmerican, theAssoci- ation for the Study of Animal Behavior in Great Britain, and the International Ethological Congress have become the lead- ing organizations in the Ô¨Åeld of animal behavior studies.

Many comparative psychologists participate in these. The International Society for Comparative psychology, founded in 1983, has great possibilities that have not yet been realized.
