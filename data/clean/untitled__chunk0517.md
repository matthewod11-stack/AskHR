# Journals

Beginning in 1947, the Journal of Comparative Psychology adopted a name more descriptive of its coverage: the Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology. That title re- mained until 1983, when it was split into three journals even more descriptive of the three prominent parts of animal psy- chology at the time: Behavioral Neuroscience, the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, and the reformulated Journal of Comparative Psychology.

The scope of the growth of animal psychology can be seen in an analysis of the articles appearing in the Journal of Com- parative and Physiological Psychology in 1963 as compared with 1949 (Dewsbury, in press-b). The number of articles published increased by a factor of nearly 3.5 from 60 to 208. There were few footnote credits to federal funding sources in 1949; by 1963, just 14 years later, it had risen eightfold.

Comparative psychologists published in other American journals as well. Some comparative psychologists found American journals uncongenial and published in the grow- ing stable of European journals, including Animal Behav- iour, Behaviour, and the Zeitschrift f√ºr Tierpsychologie (now Ethology).
