ctive ﬁve decades. Through this work,

we’ve come to realize that the secret to good outcomes in cross-cultural

contexts involves respecting four basic rules: First, look past cultural diﬀerences and focus instead on individual players. Second, work out

whether your counterpart is seeking to exploit a perceived advantage or

is interested in generating value for both parties. Third, create shared

norms for the negotiation (rather than adapting to the other party’s rituals). Finally, leverage the diﬀerences in preferences between parties

to improve outcomes for everyone. Following these four rules will help

you create a stable and lasting deal.

Let’s begin by looking at why it’s best to focus on the person rather than

# the culture.

# [ Rule 1 ]

## Negotiate with the Person, Not the Culture

Culture can be deﬁned as the operating system through which we make

sense of and interact with the world. Culture inﬂuences our behaviors

and perceptions as we go about our day-to-day business. A very strong

culture can foster ethnocentrism—an assumption that one’s own norms

are or should be shared by everyone. This is a recipe for conﬂict.

There are many dimensions along which cultures can vary, such

as tolerance for risk and how to handle conﬂict. Communication

is another obvious one. Israelis, for instance, are generally direct

and straightforward in communicating, whereas Mexicans tend to be

indirect in giving feedback, especially on sensitive issues. Of course,

individuals may hew to their cultures to a greater or lesser extent. Some

Mexicans are very direct, and some Israelis are far from straightforward.

In some contexts, the various dimensions can serve as a framework for

interpreting and for setting behaviors. For example, INSEAD professor

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

Erin Meyer advises that when adapting to a new culture, people should

strive to behave according to the midpoint of the local range on a given

# cultural dimension.

## But in a very speciﬁc context like a negotiation, knowledge of local

culture is of limited value because your counterpart may not represent

its norms. Imagine you are preparing to negotiate with an Angolan

executive, and you have read widely about Angolan cultural norms in

preparation. Unbeknownst to you, however, your counterpart was born

in Angola of foreign parents, educated in a British school there, traveled

to France to continue her studies, married an Indian partner, converted

to Islam, worked in sales for a U.S. company and then in procurement

for a Japanese corporation, and has been living in China for the past

11 years. This executive is unlikely to be prototypical of her national

culture, and thus you should be careful when using your research to

make assumptions about her behavior.

In a negotiation, you are trying to understand the individual in front of you. And in this context, a focus on cultural diﬀerences may encourage

unconscious stereotyping—that is, narrowly classifying and attributing

expected behaviors to others. This creates two risks:

Negative perceptions. Stereotypes may foster perceptions of cultural

superiority or inferiority, leading to a sense of entitlement or a lack

of empathy toward the other party. That can feed a rationalization for

# conﬂict.

Presumption of universality. Stereotyping disregards the individuality

and diversity present within any culture, which may blind negotiators

to opportunities for positive outcomes and learning from their

# counterparts.
