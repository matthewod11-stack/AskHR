## of manager burnout across the organization.

The issue isn’t a lack of belief in culture. It’s a lack of modeled alignment

from the top. When executives treat culture as something to delegate

instead of something to live, they create confusion, cynicism, and load-

bearing strain at the middle.

By contrast, one Southeast Asian conglomerate took a diﬀerent

approach. Instead of pushing culture downward, it started at the

top—by redesigning senior leadership meetings to reinforce cultural

alignment. Executives began co-creating agendas with junior staﬀ,

practicing open dissent in front of peers, and recording sessions for

wider team visibility. Within a year, manager alignment scores rose 37%,

and executive credibility improved across every business unit.

The lesson is clear: if culture isn’t consistently modeled at the highest

levels, it won’t take root anywhere else. Middle managers cannot

enforce what senior leaders won’t embody. Culture isn’t a message to

be passed down. It’s a behavior to be practiced up close.
