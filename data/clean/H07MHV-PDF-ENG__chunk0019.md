## mechanical engineering, animal handling, and other hands-on jobs.

Spatial visualizers tend to think in patterns and abstraction, and are

often skilled in mathematics, computer programming, and music. We

have distinct approaches to problem solving: Object visualizers can see

how mechanical devices work, while spatial visualizers calculate how

they are supposed to work. Iâ€™ve made the analogy that object visualizers

make the trains, and spatial visualizers make them run. We need both
