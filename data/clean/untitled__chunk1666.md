## Identifying Personality Characteristics and Psychopathology

symptom-related scales are included in the MCMI, and some personality disorder scales are available for the MMPI, these are not usually regarded as a strength of either, and many practitioners have found some advantage in using both in- struments together in complementary fashion.

The original MCMI has been revised twice, with the current version, the MCMI-III, having been published in 1994 (Millon, 1994; see also Millon, 1996). Millon also extended his test downward to include an adolescent form, originally known as the Millon Adolescent Personality In- ventory (MAPI) and currently in revised form as the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI) (Millon & Davis, 1993; Millon, Green, & Meagher, 1982).
