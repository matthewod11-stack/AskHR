# Charas

directors, practices, were central to our quanti- tative investigation of ‘teamwork’ at the board level (Charas and Perelli, 2013).

In deconstructing boards and the hypothe- sized impact on corporate performance, we reference the F&M (1999) paradigm-shifting model (see Figure 1). We speciﬁcally focus on the impact of the processes or the relationship- dynamic on board-level and ﬁrm-level out- comes. F&M’s theory articulates should be that board processes explored for three reasons: ‘inﬂuence of board demography on ﬁrm performance … [is] com- plex and indirect’, ‘beliefs and behaviors [can- not] be inferred reliably from demographic variables alone’ and the ‘study of process con- structs has the potential to expand and reﬁne our understanding of group dynamics’ (F&M, 1999). Their work ushered in a new era of research – to consider boards in an economic- behavioral context (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004; Hambrick et al, 2008; Huse et al, 2011).
