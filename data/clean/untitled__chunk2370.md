# Practice Characteristics

School psychology practice remained similar to the previous period, although its roles and functions in the area of thera- peutic interventions and consultation expanded somewhat. Whereas World War I had launched the contributions of psy- chological testing, World War II launched the contributions of psychotherapy to war veterans and indirectly to school psychological practice. The period 1940–1970 brought to the fore the theories of Carl Rogers, Fritz Perls, Albert Ellis, and others in addition to the dynamic Freudian therapies. In addition, Skinnerian theory was advancing the position of behavioral psychology and its applications in behavior modiﬁcation. The growth of therapeutic psychology was also heightened by the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963, which encouraged widespread development of community-based clinics for therapy in addition to psycho- logical assessment.
