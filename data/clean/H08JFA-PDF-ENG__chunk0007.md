# my health.

This realization came to me after I had hastily completed a report

(because there was so much to get done), and my manager said, “This

could have been a much better report if you’d spent a little more time on

it.”

The irony was hard to ignore. Doing more was making me less

productive. It was also leaving me overworked, overwhelmed, and

exhausted.
