His endeavors made real what psychologists call “counterfactual

thinking”: imagining an alternative to how things currently are. It’s one

themselves and conﬁrming or dispelling notions about what they’d

rather be doing. As a result, whether they make a big change or return

to their routines, they feel more satisﬁed in their choices. Paul’s time

as an explorer helped him hone his thinking and his skills in travel and

hospitality, which led to a post-consulting career at Airbnb.
