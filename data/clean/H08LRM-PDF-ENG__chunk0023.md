## HBR / The Big Idea / The Case for Sabbaticals — and How to Take a Successful One

It’s worth noting that you don’t have to travel far to qualify as an

explorer. Plenty of folks ﬁnd ways to experiment with new futures closer

to home by volunteering in their communities, trying new hobbies, or

taking regional trips.

The burned-out. Mary spent her entire career at a sports-focused

nonproﬁt. The work was stressful but meaningful, so no matter how diﬃcult it got, she soldiered on. A decade in, a board member suggested

that Mary might want to take a paid sabbatical, supported by a local

funder who understood the pressures of serving others for a living. After

six months of preparation — clearing out her inbox and ensuring that

her colleagues could cover her absence — Mary took the time oﬀ. At

ﬁrst, she was paralyzed by the lack of responsibilities and found herself

continuing to do some work from home during her ﬁrst week oﬀ. But

once she was en route to France — with her laptop left behind at home

— she ﬁnally began to relax. Two months later, she returned to work

feeling reenergized and conﬁdent. She also realized that things needed

to change in order for her to re-up her tenure as leader. Mary lobbied the

board for a new executive hire to handle the increased workload she’d

taken on herself as the organization grew.
