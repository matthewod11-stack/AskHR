# ABSTRACT

Supply chains act as the backbone of the world economy. The ever-increasing challenges and

complexities have led to several revolutionary concepts in supply chain practice. This study

aims to capture the significant research orientation and practices of supply chains and future

alignment with challenges of inexperienced nature. The increasing importance of Hyper-

agility, Industry 5.0 considerations and evolving sustainability paradigms have been

discussed. This study aims to capture the robustness of current supply chain practices to

address future challenges regarding the human-centric Industrial Revolution, extreme time

pressure requirements, and incorporating evolving dimensions of sustainable practices in the

changing business landscape. Reconfiguration and flexible supply chain strategies have been

suggested as the robust platform for future evolving drivers.
