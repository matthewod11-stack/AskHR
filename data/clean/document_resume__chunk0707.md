Because appraisals are used to make judgments for personnel decisions, such as promotions and compensation, and appraisal data are used to make com- parisons among employees, appraisal systems must be standardized in form and administration. Lack of standardization in forms, appraisers, procedures, and on raises the question of whether differences in performance appraisals result from the system and its administration rather than from differences in employee's performance.57
