# Academy of Management Review

so much progress been made in explicating the etiology of work motivation.

Perhaps best known of the cognitive theories is expectancy (or expectancy-valence) theory. Expectancy theory derives from the early work of Lewin (1938) and Tolman (1959), who saw be- havior as purposeful, goal directed, and largely based on conscious intentions. Vroom (1964) pre- sented the first systematic formulation of ex- pectancy theory as it related to the workplace. He argued that employees tend to rationally evaluate various on-the-job work behaviors (e.g., working harder) and then choose those be- haviors they believe will lead to their most val- ued work-related rewards and outcomes (e.g., a promotion). Thus, the attractiveness of a partic- ular task and the energy invested in it will de- pend a great deal on the extent to which the employee believes its accomplishment will lead to valued outcomes.

several emerging models of cross-cultural influ- ences on work motivation and job performance (Bhagat & McQuaid, 1982; Earley, 1997; Steers & Sanchez-Runde, 2001; Triandis, 1995).

In addition to expectancy theory, a number of other important cognitive theories of work moti- vation have been developed since the 1960s, each with its own focus. Adams (1963), for exam- ple, introduced equity theory to explain how em- ployees respond both cognitively and behavior- ally to perceived unfairness in the workplace (see also Mowday & Colwell, 2003, and Weick, Bougon, & Maruyama, 1976). Adams argued that both conditions of underpayment and overpay- ment can influence subsequent behavior. Re- cent work on procedural and distributive justice further develops this area using the fundamen- tal concept of equity and its consequences (Cro- panzano & Rupp, 2003; Folger, 1986; Greenberg, 1993; Sweeney & McFarlin, 1993).

Porter and Lawler (1968) expanded Vroom’s initial work to recognize the role of individual differences (e.g., employee abilities and skills) and role clarity in linking job effort to actual job performance. Porter and Lawler also clarified the relationship between performance and sub- sequent satisfaction, arguing that this relation- ship is mediated by the extent and quality of the rewards employees receive in exchange for good job performance. Finally, Porter and Lawler incorporated a feedback loop to recog- nize learning by employees about past relation- ships. That is, if superior performance in the past failed to lead to superior rewards, future employee effort may suffer as incentives and the reward system lose credibility in the employee’s eyes.

Goal-setting theory also emerged in the late 1960s, as researchers began to discover that the simple act of specifying targets for behavior en- hanced task performance (Locke, 1968, 1996; Steers & Porter, 1974). Research in this arena showed that goal specificity, goal difficulty, and goal commitment each served to enhance task performance. Based on numerous empirical studies, Locke and Latham (1990) subsequently proposed a formal theory of goal setting. Earley and Erez (1991) later added a time dimension to this topic by examining the role of cognitive processing on motivation, while Crown and Rosse (1995) examined the role of group goals, in addition to individual goals, on performance. Applications of goal-setting theory in the form of individual and team management-by-objectives programs are now used widely throughout in- dustry (Ambrose & Kulik, 1999).

Since its initial publication, a number of scholars have worked to extend or further refine the basic cognitive expectancy framework to re- flect emerging research findings and new theo- retical developments (e.g., Kanfer, 1990; Mitch- ell, 1997). For example, expectancy theory has been used to study forms of work behavior other than job performance, including employee ab- senteeism, turnover, and organizational citizen- ship behavior (Mobley, 1977; Mowday, Porter, & Steers, 1982; Organ, 1988; Porter & Steers, 1973; Steers & Rhodes, 1978). Researchers have also linked group expectations and social influences to individual work motivation decisions (Porter, Lawler, & Hackman, 1975). Finally, basic expect- ancy principles have been incorporated into

Finally, this period saw significant develop- ments focusing on the role of social cognition and self-efficacy on behavior and performance by such leading researchers as Bandura (1977a,b, 1997). Bandura proposed a social cog- nitive theory, suggesting that self-confidence lies at the heart of an individual’s incentive to act or to be proactive. Indeed, after a major review of the research literature on social cog- nition and self-efficacy, Stajkovic and Luthans (1998, 2003) found considerable support for the role of self-efficacy in determining work- related performance, particularly as moder- ated by task complexity and locus of control.
