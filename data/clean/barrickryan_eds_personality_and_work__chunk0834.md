## Typical Versus Maximum Performance Criteria

Another important characteristic of performance criteria is whether they are maximum or typical performance indicators. Ac- cording to Sackett, Zedeck, and Fogli (1988), three characteristics distinguish maximum from typical performance measures: short time duration of performance, evaluative context, and acceptance of the challenge to perform maximally. Not surprisingly, person- ality variables relate differently to criteria that are categorized as maximum or typical based on these three characteristics. Open- ness to Experience, for example, is most predictive of maximum transformational leadership performance criteria, whereas Emo- tional Stability is most predictive of typical transformational lead- ership criteria, with Extraversion predictive of both (Ployhart, Lim, & Chan, 2001).

Most personality scales are regarded as measures of typical be- havior and as such might be expected to correlate with measures of typical rather than maximum performance criteria. The Ploy- hart et al. (2001) study indicates that is an overly simplistic ex- pectation. Speculating on other possible examples, the predictors of decision-making quality (typical performance criterion) versus decision-making quality under stress or in rapidly changing cir- cumstances (maximum performance criterion) may differ. Emo- tional Stability (reaction to stress) may predict quality of decision
