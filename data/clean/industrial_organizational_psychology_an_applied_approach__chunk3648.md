temperature probably did not change, but discomfort decreased along with the effective temperature. Likewise, we might recall a “biting wind” that made a win- ter day seem so cold.

Finally, the effective temperature is affected by the heat that radiates from other objects in the environment. For example, the field-level temperature of out- door sports stadiums that use artificial turf is usually much higher than the air temperature in the stands because heat radiates from the artificial turf. Other examples of this radiation effect include how much hotter it feels when sitting with a group of people than when sitting alone or how much hotter it feels when lying on the sand at the beach than when sitting up.

I can remember many summer days in Los Angeles when the air tempera- ture was already more than  degrees but was combined with heat radiating from the sidewalk adding  degrees more, thus making walking uncomfortable. Similarly, a manager who thinks that her outdoor salespeople will be fine in an -degree temperature must also account for the effective temperature caused by radiating heat. An air temperature of  degrees above a concrete sidewalk is not the same as  degrees above a dirt road.

Both air temperature and humidity interact with the body’s ability to cool down through radiation and evaporation. When air temperature is higher than body temperature, we are unable to radiate heat. When humidity is high, it is more difficult to lose body heat through evaporation. Thus, high air temperature and high humidity make the body’s “natural cooling system” less effective.

The relevant question here, of course, is what happens when the effective temperature in the working environment is high or low? As shown in Figure . the answer is that performance usually deteriorates. The degree of deterioration, however, depends on several factors, including the type of task, the workload, and the number and frequency of rest periods that are allowed.

Effects on Tasks. Research indicates that extremely high or low temperatures can affect performance on cognitive, physical, and perceptual tasks. A meta-analysis by Pilcher, Nadler, and Busch () found that performance dropped by .% when temperatures rose above  degrees and by .% when temperatures fell below  degrees. Hot temperatures had their greatest effect on reaction time and on performance on attentional, perceptual, and mathematical tasks. Cold temperatures had their greatest effect on reasoning, memory, and learning tasks. Interestingly, extreme temperatures seem to have their greatest effect on tasks
