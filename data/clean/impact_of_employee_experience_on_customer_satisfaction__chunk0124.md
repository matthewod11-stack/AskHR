development conversations and one-on-one talks. An employee has +50 eMOT’s

during their employment cycle. If an organization performs well during these special

touchpoints which lead to inefficiency with no value creation, calling them Employee

Friction Points (EFPs). These could be bad IT systems, difficult interfaces, bad and

inefficient meetings, or email culture. An organization typically has more than 25

collecting insight about employees’ experiences during employee journey. This

includes all small journeys, touchpoints, and moment of truth.
