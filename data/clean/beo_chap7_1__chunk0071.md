# 7.3.2 Peers and Groups

One place in which social preferences have entered labor economics is in the con-

cept of “peer pressure.” Peer pressure is often invoked to explain why group-based

incentives are surprisingly successful despite the incentive to free ride. For example,

Knez and Simester (2001) note that a $65/month bonus for all Continental Airlines

employees, for improved on-time-arrival rates, actually worked, even though any

one employee’s performance has a minuscule effect on the firm’s overall on-time

performance. They note the important influence of immediate pressure by peers to

improve performance (see also Kandel and Lazear 1992). The experimental litera-

ture on public goods games with sanctions also shows the power of peer pressure

(see, for example, Yamagishi 1988; Fehr and Gachter 2000). When subjects can

punish others at a cost to themselves, they often do so, which drives contributions

up. Note that not every subject punishes, but enough do so to create higher contri-
