# Advice in Practice

Case Study #1: Request joint feedback and make sure your boss is

aware of your contributions. Lauren Crain, a digital marketer, knows

all too well what it’s like to work with colleagues who aren’t up to

scratch. “In the past, I used to do the work for them, take over when

talking about projects since they would know so little about them, and

do things to save face for the company,” she says.

“But I wasn’t helping the company; in fact, I was helping these

underperformers, and in turn, actually hurting the company by

protecting bad employees.”
