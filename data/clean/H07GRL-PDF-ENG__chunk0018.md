## HBR / Digital Article / How a Parent’s Experience at Work Impacts Their Kids

was sick and needed to be picked up right away. She still had three

clients on her schedule for the day, but her boss simply said, “Go, of

course. Go. Family comes ﬁrst. We’ll ﬁgure this out.” This simple act of

humanity and ﬂexibility didn’t cost much, but it made a big diﬀerence,

enabling a parent to care for her child in a moment of crisis.

In addition, beyond making accommodations or oﬀering increased

ﬂexibility, employers can also take steps to ensure work itself is

a positive experience. Another worker we talked to, Linda, was a

shipment packer at a candle manufacturing plant. Her boss discovered

that without prompting, she had begun inserting notes and sample

candle scents in the packages she prepared for her clients. Her boss

hadn’t asked her to do this, and she hadn’t gotten approval to include

these extras in the packages — but her customers appreciated it so much

that they began asking for Linda by name when placing their orders.

In response, rather than ignoring the issue, or worse yet, punishing

Linda for failing to follow standard shipping procedures, her boss asked

her to train her coworkers in her unique approach to customer service,

and gave her an award for innovation along with a promotion. Linda

felt respected and supported, and she described how rather than being

a drain, “work had become fun.” This in turn enabled Linda to come

home feeling upbeat and positive (rather than exhausted and depleted),

with enough energy to fully engage in parenting her infant son.

When it comes to promoting workers’ physical and mental health,

organizations tend to focus on high-level policy changes such as

ﬂexible scheduling options, more paid leave, etc. And to be sure, these

systemic initiatives are certainly important. But our research suggests

that ensuring workers feel respected and supported in their day-to-

day is often just as critical. That means teaching and empowering

supervisors to support parents, ﬁnding creative ways to give workers

more autonomy, and helping managers and workers alike develop
