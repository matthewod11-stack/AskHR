# Lay the groundwork.

Optimizing your brain for focus starts with fundamental self-care,

according to Montminy. “You need to prioritize foundational habits like

sleep, hydration, and physical activity,” she says. “You could try all the

mental health hacks in the world, and you’re not going to get anywhere

if you’re not sleeping well and not hydrating.”

Creating consistent environmental cues is also key. Montminy

recommends establishing “focus rituals,” or signals that tell your brain it’s time to concentrate — like a dedicated workspace, a particular desk

setup, or a consistent routine that primes you for deep work. Mark

suggests practical steps to eliminate distractions: turn oﬀ notiﬁcations,

lock away your phone when working, and use app blockers to hide

digital temptations. The goal is to “create friction” and make it harder to

be distracted, she says.

Train your brain’s attention.

With the fundamentals in place, you next need to harness your natural

focus. Our attention is goal-directed, meaning we naturally concentrate

on what aligns with our objectives and priorities, explains Mark. This

principle is rooted in the work of William James, widely considered the

father of American psychology. “If your goals are very clear, that’s going

to keep you focused.” To tap into this attentional bias and selectively

focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others, Mark recommends a

concrete approach: “Write down your goals and put them in a place

where they’re in your visual ﬁeld,” she says. “Put them on a post-it if

that’s what it takes for you to be constantly reminded of what you’re

trying to accomplish.” Surrounding yourself with visual reminders of

your goals helps train your brain to zero in on what’s essential.
