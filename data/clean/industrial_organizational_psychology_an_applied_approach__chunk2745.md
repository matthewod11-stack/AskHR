# An Introduction to Leadership

Many different theories about leadership have been developed over the last few decades. Although none of the theories “tells the whole story” about leadership, each has received at least some empirical support. Understanding the theories and research behind leadership is important because the theory that company executives believe about leadership will, for the most part, determine how an organization selects or develops its managers.

For example, if we believe that certain people are “born leaders” because of their personal traits, needs, or orientation, then managers could be selected partially on the basis of their scores on certain tests. But if we believe that leader- ship consists of specific skills or behaviors, then theoretically we should be able to train any employee to become an outstanding leader. If we believe that good leadership is the result of an interaction between certain types of behaviors and particular aspects of the situation, then we might choose certain types of people to be leaders at any given time, or we might teach leaders how to adapt their behavior to meet the situation.

The following pages provide brief explanations of the most popular lead- ership theories. When reading about each theory, think about what the theory would imply about the selection or development of leaders for an organization. In addition, think of how you manage and the type of leader you wish to be.
