437

Imagine a company with thousands of workers that has seen sales drop in each

of the past five years. The president of the company steps down, and a new president is installed. Several years later, the company makes a profit, and

everyone hails the new president as the reason for the improvement.

Now imagine a football team with a winning record in each of the last ten years. The team’s coach leaves for another school, and the team loses the majority of its games in the next few years.

In both of these examples, a new leader took over. In the first example, the organization became more successful, whereas in the second example, the team went into decline. How much of the organization’s performance can be attributed to the leader? If the leader was the major cause of the changes in performance, why was one leader successful and the other a failure? These types of questions will be addressed in this chapter. To get you thinking about leadership, complete Exercise . in your workbook.
