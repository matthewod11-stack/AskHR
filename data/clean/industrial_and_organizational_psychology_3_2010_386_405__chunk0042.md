a coherent picture of results can inhibit programmatic research.

Question 2: Whatarethedifferencesin researchmethods across the IOOB and JDM ﬁelds? What are the opportunities and obstacles created by these differ- encesinmethods?

Scott Highhouse: The very different methods may be part of the barrier to cross-fertilization. There is an experimen- tal bias in the JDM area. The ﬁeld is built on doing simple, elegant,little experimentsthat are aimed at interesting questions, whereas in IOOB—and I am making caricatures here—it is more like taking elegant, sophis- ticated statistics and sometimes applying them to uninteresting questions. In addi- tion to this difference in orientation, there tends to be a bias in IOOB against research done in labs or employing paper simula- tions with students, which are all staples of JDM research. My answer to this bias is that Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize using very sterile, simple, paper problems and showing how much application those problems have to our everyday lives and to economic thinking (I should note that economists were traditionally even more critical of laboratory research with student subjects). If we could see beyond the meth- ods and see beyond the sample to look at the question and what kinds of applied issues it is addressing, we would be better off in IOOB (see in this regard Highhouse & Gillespie, 2009). Itisthetheoriesthatgen- eralize,nottheeffects.

that we publish in differ- ent journals also contributes to the lack of cross-fertilization. The exception is OBHDP. However, having been involved with OBHDP (like Dan), I can attest that the two ﬁelds are together in the journal but they are not together in terms of the research (see also Naylor, 1984). It is two different groups of people who submit articles, and there is a different set of reviewers for each area. As a result, IOOB and JDM are just living together in those pages.
