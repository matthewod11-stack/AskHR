# A Shift to Learning Experience Platforms

How employees know what to learn next

Organizing and tracking what employees are learning can be a

cumbersome task. For years, this work has been done by software

known as “learning management systems” (LMS), which are relatively

simple tools that store learning material, typically in the form of

presentations, videos, and text. Most large companies have one, but few

employees spend much time on them.
