## 3 Reasons Why Feedback Creates More Meaningful Work

- 1. Feedback Helps with Mastery

Feedback — when done well — identiﬁes behaviors that an employee

can change. Feedback allows an employee to make adjustments to get

better or perfect a skill. Mastery, and the process of gaining mastery

and overcoming challenges, is a critical ingredient to meaningful work.

From a young age, humans crave mastery. Think about the two-year-old

who repeatedly tries to put two Legos together — and the sheer delight

that happens when they ﬁnally “click.” That delight can happen in the

workplace as well. A manager’s feedback aids in the pursuit of mastery

by letting the employee know what they can do to continue to improve.

How can you ensure your feedback encourages mastery? First, don’t

be afraid of assigning challenging tasks and giving feedback along the

way. Let your employee know upfront that the work might be harder

than usual, but that you’ll be providing support as they navigate it.

Next, and most importantly, refrain from taking over a task or project

when an employee is struggling. In the moment, it might feel like the

“nice” thing to do is to take over the reins, but by doing so, you’re

depriving your employee of both the joy of overcoming a challenge and

the opportunity for more meaningful work. Last, when giving feedback,

identify opportunities for your employee to apply what she learned in

tackling one challenging task to another context.

- 2. Feedback Highlights an Employee’s Impact

Well-structured feedback starts with an observation of a behavior and

then points out the impact that behavior has on an individual, a team, a

project, or an organization. This impact helps the employee understand

why their work matters, and by extension why they matter at work.
