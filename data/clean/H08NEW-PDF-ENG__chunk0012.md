## organization and your ﬁrm’s pay structure.

The more employees there are, the more conﬁdent you can be about

whether a pay gap happened by chance. To see why, imagine ﬂipping

a coin. If it comes up heads 3 times out of 4, you might attribute that

to chance. If it comes up heads 30 times out of 40, you would be more

convinced the coin was weighted toward heads.

For similar reasons, the more regimented a ﬁrm’s salary structure

—that is, the more precisely an employee’s job and qualiﬁcations

determine their pay—the more likely it is that a pay gap of a given

size will be considered signiﬁcant to a court. In other words, if jobs

and qualiﬁcations closely predict employees’ pay at a ﬁrm, it’s harder to

attribute a pay gap within that organization to chance.
