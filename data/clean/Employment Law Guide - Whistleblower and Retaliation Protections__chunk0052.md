## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

The Supreme Court has held that the employee protection provisions of the ERA do not preempt existing state

statutes and common law claims. The other statutes listed above should be consulted separately to determine

whether or not their employee protection provisions are supplementary to protection provided by state laws.
