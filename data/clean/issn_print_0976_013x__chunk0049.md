# INTRODUCTION

Thiruvananthapuram is capital of Kerala –a southern province of India. The city has a unique

topography comprising res(cid:415)ng hills, ﬂourishing groves, extensive coast lines, chao(cid:415)c urban

trails, and lively metropolitan suburbs. Also, it is the most populous city of Kerala. The city is

well connected with the rest of India through railways, roads, waterways, and airways.

Tradi(cid:415)onally, people of the Thiruvananthapuram district were engaged in mineral processing,

sugar milling, tex(cid:415)les, handicra(cid:332)s, rice cul(cid:415)va(cid:415)on and coastal ﬁshing1. However, today it has

emerged as a hub of technology-driven industries thanks to an exci(cid:415)ng entrepreneurial

ecosystem triggered by Technopark. As a result, the city has become hothouse for burgeoning

start-ups leading to huge job opportuni(cid:415)es for the young and talented workforce drawn from

across the country and other parts of the world. Diversity of workforce in the city has also

enriched the socio-cultural milieu of Thiruvananthapuram for which signiﬁcant credit must be

assigned to Technopark.

Technopark was established by the Government of Kerala in 1990 as an autonomous

organiza(cid:415)on to meet the infrastructure needs of emerging electronics and Informa(cid:415)on

Technology industry even before India adopted the policy of liberaliza(cid:415)on, priva(cid:415)za(cid:415)on, and

globaliza(cid:415)on. It is registered under the Travancore-Cochin Literary, Scien(cid:415)ﬁc and Charitable

Socie(cid:415)es Registra(cid:415)on Act, 1955. By 1995, ﬁrst phase of Technopark was ready to welcome the

entrepreneurs who were interested in se(cid:427)ng up their factories or oﬃces in a contemporary

industrial campus with all the ameni(cid:415)es under the sky. Facili(cid:415)es at the Technopark manifested

its vision “to provide a holis(cid:415)c enabling environment to make knowledge industry intrinsically

compe(cid:415)(cid:415)ve and world class”. Further, the organiza(cid:415)on truly lived up to its lo(cid:332)y mission
