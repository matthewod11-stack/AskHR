# 5.1 Managerial implications

The rapid expansion of coaching in firms means that the practice is often conducted in ways

that cannot guarantee its effectiveness, giving rise to an effect that is similar to what Woodside

(2011) calls “incompetence training” and that we call “incompetence coaching”. In a previous

study, Hutchinson and Purcell (2010) find that slightly less than half of coaches are satisfied

with coaching. The process can fail, with consequent costs for both the participants and the

firm. After conducting rigorous research, we have designed a model that firms can use to help

them implement coaching processes successfully. We analysed the conditions and factors of

the coaching process that are necessary to ensure its effectiveness.

Our results enable us to conclude that coaching processes are a useful tool for developing

professionals in organisations, as we found an effect on the performance of human capital.

Coaching also helps firms improve their competitive position via effects on organisational

performance, sales increases and productivity growth. With the effectiveness of such coaching

empirically supported, the next step is to determine how best to conduct the process. As we

stated in the theoretical framework section, firms should plan coaching in detail, including the

objectives to be pursued. Participants should be given opportunities to develop and achieve

promotions, and the process should improve their decision making. To ensure the success of

the process, the exchange between the coach and coachee should be positive, with both

participants perceiving the benefits to outweigh the costs. Thus, an organisation must strive to

maximise benefits and minimise costs. One of the critical points is the selection of participants;

specifically, firms should closely examine a coach’s profile. The coach should know the

organisation well, and his/her personal characteristics should suit those of the coachee in

aspects such as the equivalence of professional status, personal affinities and the level of

commitment to the process. In particular, the coachee must be an employee with the potential

to develop professionally and thus to fully exploit the benefits of the process, work hard

throughout the process and trust the coach. Selecting the appropriate participants and

providing the proper facilities will limit socio-emotional conflicts and lower opportunity costs on

both sides, which will increase the perceived net benefits of the process (i.e., ensure its

success). Improvements in a coachee’s individual performance will translate into better

performance in his/her daily work in the firm, which will positively affect his/her organisation’s
