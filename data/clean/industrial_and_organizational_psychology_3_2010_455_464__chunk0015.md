## BarriersAttributabletoDifferencesin MethodologicalTradition

In our focal article, we had discussed several methodological barriers to integra- tion between IOOB and JDM. We had argued that the ﬁelds’ two methodological approaches should be viewed as comple- mentary and that IOOB should be much more open to laboratory research. The com- mentators responded to our contentions, focusing primarily on external validity and attendant issues.

The various comments can be summa- rized by Rosen et al.’s (2010) observation that JDM researchers sometimes ‘‘control the reality out of the research’’ and Staw’s ‘‘[a]lthough JDM (2010) contention that tries to control away the context, organi- zational researchers savor it.’’ The chief concerns focus on the lack of mundane realism in JDM experiments: The commen- tators take issue with the tasks used to study phenomena, the samples employed, and the focus on a speciﬁc time point in the decision-making process. Speciﬁ- cally, the commentators contend that the laboratory-based simple tasks employed by JDM researchers do not approximate the complexity of organizational life. As such, the ﬁndings derived from these research paradigms are, in their view, of little rele- vance to IOOB, where a contingency per- spective is needed to fully understand the phenomena in question (see, e.g., Hayes & Wooldridge, 2010; Rosen et al., 2010; Staw, 2010). In addition, the student—or, more generally, nonexpert—samples rou- tinely used in JDM research gave pause to some of our commentators (Rosen et al., 2010; Staw, 2010). Finally, Rosen et al. note that although JDM research tends to focus on the ultimate decision, the process that leadsuptothis decisionisequally important and should not be overlooked.

We respond in two ways. First, we call for a more nuanced and less ‘‘black or white’’ discussion of external validity (gen- eralizability). Second, we remind readers that a lack of internal validity is as harmful
