# Wissler Blows the Whistle

A student of Cattell’s, Clark Wissler (1901), decided to vali- date Cattell’s tests. Using 21 of these tests, he investigated among Columbia University undergraduates the correlations of the tests with each other and with college grades. The re- sults were devastating: Test scores neither intercorrelated much among themselves, nor did they correlate signiﬁcantly with undergraduate grades. The lack of correlation could not have been due entirely to unreliability of the grades or to re- striction of range, because the grades did correlate among themselves. A new approach seemed to be needed.
