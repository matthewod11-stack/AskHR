## Aligning Strategies and Motivation Styles

Many leaders attempting transformation initiatives fail in three ways.

First, they don’t clearly deﬁne the type of change their organization

or departments are facing, which means they can’t clearly deﬁne

their speciﬁc objectives. Second, they often apply a one-size-ﬁts-all

strategy to their situation and don’t assess what sort of balance it calls
