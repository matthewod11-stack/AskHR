# Reliability and validity

To test the construct validity, the study conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on the construct measures. The results of the EFA showed that eight factors emerged with eigenvalues greater than 1, accounting for 69.76% of the variance. The reliability of the constructs was tested using Cronbach’s alpha value analysis. The Cronbach’s alpha values of the constructs ranged from .791 to .893. These results indicated adequate internal consistency associated with most of the measures. We therefore decided that the measures had adequate internal consistency and computed composite scores (i.e. averages of item scores in scale) of each scale for use in further analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also carried out to ensure discriminant validity. The fit indices, χ2 = 593.721,df = 322,p<.001,χ2/df = 1.844;goodnessoffitindex (GFI) = 0.906; incremental fit index (IFI) = 0.951; adjusted good- ness of fit index (AGFI) = 0.882; normed fit index (NFI) = 0.900; Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.986; and comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.951 showed that the hypothesized four-factor model had a good fit. Hence, the factors in the measurement model had adequate reliability and validity (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010).
