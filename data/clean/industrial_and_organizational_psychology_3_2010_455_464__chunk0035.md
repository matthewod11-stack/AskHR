it fromcharacteristic (i.e., trait) performance (see also Dalal & Hulin, 2008).

Second, the commentaries include some important concrete recommendations. For example, Byham (2010) proposes assess- ment centers (e.g., ‘‘in-basket/box’’ and problem analysis exercises; see also Staw, 2010) as a way to increase collaboration between IOOB and JDM. As discussed in a previous section, we believe that there is a strong case for the use of traditional laboratory experiments in IOOB; yet, we deﬁnitely agree with Byham’s assertion that ‘‘[a]ssessment centers are an excellent way of studying decision making.’’ Assessment centers have the potential to provide not only a good balance of internal and external validity (including, as they do, what Staw, 2010, refers to as ‘‘organization like’’ sam- ples and settings) but also a good source of information into decision-making processes and outcomes. As Byham recommends, researchers should attempt to partner with organizations to obtain existing archival assessment center data or, better yet, to jointly develop new assessment center tasks that allow for the testing of speciﬁc hypothe- ses of interest.

suggests that researchers use assessment-center-type work simulation tasks in the laboratory, using undergraduate students. In a related vein, Staw (2010) discusses the issue of lab- oratory researchersconstructing their exper- imental tasks ‘‘in ways that more accurately capture the organizational experience’’ (see alsoHayes &Wooldridge, 2010) andargues for qualitative approaches such as observa- tions and unstructured interviews as useful domain-entry techniques that will allow researchers to construct laboratory tasks ‘‘that mimic the tugs of’’ organizational the reader to several settings. We point papers by James Terborg (e.g., Terborg, Cas- tore, & DeNinno, 1976; Terborg & Davis, 1982; Terborg & Miller, 1978) as excellent examples of various types of work simula- tions involving students.
