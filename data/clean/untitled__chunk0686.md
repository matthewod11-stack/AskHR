# Summary: Premodern Realism

Although during the premodern period competing theories of cognition were offered, virtually all the premodern thinkers shared one assumption I will call cognitive realism. Cogni- tive realism is the claim that when we perceive an object under normal conditions, we accurately grasp all of its vari- ous sensory features.

Classical cognitive realism took two forms. One, percep- tual realism, may be illustrated by Aristotle’s theory of per- ception. Consider my perception of a person some meters distant. His or her appearance comprises a number of distinct sensory features: a certain height, hair color, cut and color of clothing, gait, timber of voice, and so on. Aristotle held that each of these features was picked up by the corresponding special sense. For example, the blue of a shirt caused the ﬂuid in the eye to become blue; I see the shirt as blue because it is blue. At the level of the special senses, perception reveals the world as it really is. Of course, we sometimes make mistakes about the object of perception, but Aristotle attributed such mistakes to common sense, when we integrate the informa- tionfromthespecialsenses.Thus,Imaymistakenlythinkthat I’m approaching my daughter on campus, only to ﬁnd that it’s a similar-looking young woman. The important point is that for Aristotle my error is one of judgment, not of sensation: I really did see a slender young woman about 5(cid:5)9(cid:13) tall in a leopard-print dress and hair dyed black; my mistake came in thinking it was Elizabeth.

Plato said little about perception because he distrusted it, but his metaphysical realism endorsed conclusions similar to, and even stronger than, Aristotle’s. Plato said that we identify an individual cat as a cat because it resembles the Form of the Cat in heaven and lodged innately in our soul. If I say that a small ﬂuffy dog is a cat, I am in error, because the dog really
