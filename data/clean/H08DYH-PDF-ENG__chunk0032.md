Duncan Wardle, formerly vice president of innovation and creativity at The Walt Disney Company, launched his creative consulting company iD8 & innov8 to help companies embed a culture of innovation and creativity across their entire organization. Duncan spent his 25-year career at Disney developing some of its most innovative ideas and strategies — ideas that would forever change the way the company expands its impact, trains its employees, and solves problems creatively. He has a new book releasing in December 2024 titled The Imagination Emporium, a tool kit that makes innovation accessible, creativity tangible, and the process fun.
