## Primary Relationships With Other Variables

This section provides a review and integration of the relation- ships between trust in leadership and other key constructs. Figure 1 illustrates the theoretical positioning of the constructs, including the unmeasured theoretical processes expected to mediate the relationships. We have classified variables as potential anteced- ents, consequences, or correlates according to how researchers have treated them theoretically. We caution, however, that the causal connections are empirically tenuous at present because most studies used cross-sectional research designs. As discussed in a later section, this caution is particularly warranted with the vari- ables labeled as antecedents. The framework and subsequent dis- cussion include only those variables for which sufficient data were available for the meta-analysis. In that sense, the following dis- cussion and framework are not exhaustive of all variables that have been associated with trust.
