# feedback

Organisations embrace multi-source appraisal systems for different reasons. Lepsinger and Lucia (1997) suggest that a key factor that contributes to the successful implementation of 3608 feedback is that organisations have a clear sense of what they want to accomplish through the use of feedback. The five most common uses of 3608 feedback are: 1 Career development. Towers Perrin (1998)

report that 94 per cent of the organisations they surveyed used the results of the 3608 feedback for training and development purposes. The most common use of multi-source feedback is for career development including self- development, leadership development, management/executive development and identifying employee training needs (Lepsinger and Lucia, 1997; Megginson and Casserley, 1996; Towers Perrin, 1998; Edwards and Ewen, 1996; Romano, 1994; Atwater et al., 1995). The feedback provided aims to highlight the strengths, weaknesses and development needs of the learner and the learner benefits from enhanced self-perception accuracy.

2 Culture change. Church and Bracken (1997), Tornow (1993) and London and Beatty (1993) propose that 3608 feedback can be used to facilitate organisational change. They argue that the multi-source assessment raises awareness of the importance of aligning leadership behaviours, work unit results and customer expectations with the organisation's core strategy and core values. O'Reilly (1994) advocates that many organisations use 3608 feedback for cultural change, to accelerate the shift to teamwork and to promote employee empowerment.

When an organisation aims to change the organisational culture, 3608 feedback can prove to be an effective vehicle for communicating to the employees the competencies and behaviours that the organisation values and rewards. London
