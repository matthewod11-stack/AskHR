## Ironically, however, this perception often results not from uninhibited

self-expression, but from deliberate self-regulation. Leaders seen as most “authentic” are usually those who invest signiﬁcant eﬀort

in managing impressions, curating their emotional displays, and

suppressing their less-admirable impulses. In this sense, authenticity

becomes a sophisticated form of method acting: a performance honed

over time to embody the version of oneself others ﬁnd believable and

trustworthy. Here are ﬁve practices that can help:

- 1. Curate, don’t conceal. Eﬀective leaders don’t suppress their identity; they select the parts that

serve the mission. Sharing a personal story that reinforces a company

value? Smart. Venting about your divorce in a town hall? Not so much.

- 2. Regulate before you relate.

Self-awareness and self-control are prerequisites for leadership

competence. Before reacting, pause. Before responding, breathe.
