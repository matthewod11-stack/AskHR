Beyond these simple criteria against which to compare the items on the instrument itself, the items should also be compared against the scale to be used. Berk suggested a summated (Likert) scale.28 Other scales which might be considered include: paired comparisons, equal appearing intervals, successive intervals, scalogram analysis, semantic differential, Q-sort techniques, and multidimensional scaling. Some of these procedures have serious drawbacks regarding the reliability and validity of the resulting data--paired comparisons, for example. Again, the scale should be chosen in light of the intended use of the resulting data. The summated scale (Liken-type) does lend itself to statistical analyses that go beyond simple descriptive statistics.

Once the domain has been specified drawing on-the-job analysis information, an instrument type and scale have been chosen, and items have been developed, the next consideration is the r;t3tistical analyses of the resulting data. There are two major arenas of statistical analyst -. to be considered: (1) analyses of the data in the instrument development process and (2) the analysis of the resulting data for decision or staff development use.

Three major types of analyses should be conducted at the instrument development (1) intercorrelations of items, (2) study of variability, and (3) factor analysis of item develop-

stage: the items and subscales to test for empirical verification of conceptual ment.

The analysis of the resulting data depends on the kinds of decisions to be made with the data. There is much c-mtroversy about whether performance appraisal instru- ments should he one dimensional or should represent several dimensions. Again, the literature provides no clear-cut answer. However, Smith clearly indicated that ". when several dimensions are involved several sets of criteria as composites will be required."29 Given the highly specific nature of performance appraisals, one answer to the question of one overall measure or a series of discrete measures is absolutely impos- sible. The analyses of these data would, ofcourse, help in determining the relatedness or independence of the various dimensions of the instrument.

Whether one adds all of the items into one scale or related items into subscales, Fralicx and Raju found that the weighting of items need not be as difficult as once thought lc' In their study of 112 bankers, they found that Management Weights (MGR), Equal Weights (EQL), Unit Weights (UNIT). and Factor Weights (FACT) produce highl comparable ratings. Equal weights derived by utilizing standard deviation recip- rocals and management weights achieved by having managers weight each item are considerably more time consuming than allow mg each item to contribute equally to the sum. Likewise, factor analysis is more time-consuming and requires much more sophistication A fifth weighting procedure -canonical correlationwas also used in the
