# Illustration by Benedetta Vialli

In our book Glass Walls, we tell the story of a newspaper employee

whose publisher asked her if she planned to have kids. She replied,

“Someday.” The publisher responded, “That will be your career.”

Subsequently, the publisher moved her around the newsroom, never

gave her a promotion, and assigned her to the night shift. She quit.
