## correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the

plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any

preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or

to avoid harm otherwise.

The court went on to specify that in most cases, a policy prohibiting

sexual harassment and a complaint procedure would satisfy the ﬁrst

prong of the aﬃrmative defense. And so having a policy became a proxy

for companies actually doing something to prevent sexual harassment.

As a result, it has become almost impossible for an employee to

win a hostile work environment case about sex or race harassment.
