). Excuses about not having the funds to notify applicants are probably not justified when one considers the ill feelings that may result from not contacting applicants. Don’t send the rejection letter immediately. The surprising results of a study by Waung and Brice () suggest that applicants react more positively if there is a delay in receiving the letter. Though these findings seems to go against the thought that applicants can better manage their job searches if they know they have been rejected, it may be that too quick of a rejection makes applicants feel as if they are such a loser that the organization quickly discarded them (e.g., the graduate school whose clerk rejected my application). Be as personable and as specific as possible in the letter. With the use of automated applicant tracking systems, it is fairly easy to individually address each letter, express the company’s appreciation for applying, and perhaps explain who was hired and what their qualifications were. In general, “friendly” letters result in better applicant attitudes (Aamodt & Peggans, ; Feinberg, Meoli- Stanton, & Gable, ). Including a statement about the individual who received the job can increase applicant satisfaction with both the selection process and the organization (Aamodt & Peggans, ; Gilliland et al., ). Do not include the name of a contact person. Surprisingly, research has shown that including such a contact decreases the probability that a person will reapply for future jobs or use the company’s products (Waung & Brice, ).

Perhaps the most important thing to consider when writing a letter of rejec- tion is to be honest. Do not tell applicants that their resumes will be kept on file if the files for each job opening will not be used. Adair and Pollen () think rejection letters treat job applicants like unwanted lovers; they either beat around the bush (“There were many qualified applicants”) or stall for time (“We’ll keep your resume on file”). A study by Brice and Waung () supports these ideas as most organizations either never formally reject applicants, or when they do, take an average of almost a month to do so.
