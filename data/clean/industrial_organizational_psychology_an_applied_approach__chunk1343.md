# Applied Case Study

The City of New London,

Connecticut, was developing a system to select police officers. One of the tests it selected was the Wonderlic Personnel Test, a cognitive ability test that was mentioned in this chapter. For each occupation, the Wonderlic provides a minimum score and

a maximum score. For police officers, the minimum score is 20 and the maximum is 27. Robert J. Jordan applied for a job as a police officer but was not given an inter- view because his score of 33 (equivalent to an IQ of 125) made him “too bright” to be a cop. New London’s reasoning

was that highly intelligent officers would get bored with their jobs and would either cause trouble or would quit. The New London deputy police chief was quoted as saying, “Bob Jordan is exactly the type of guy we would want to screen out. Police work is kind of mundane. We don’t deal in

gunfights every night. There’s a personality that can take that.” Turnover was a great concern as the city spent about $25,000 sending each officer through the academy.

In neighboring Groton, CT,

also the police department uses the Wonderlic but tries to hire the highest scorers possible—a policy with which most I/O psychologists would agree.

When New London’s policy received national publicity, the city became the butt of many jokes and the policy became a source of embarrassment to many of the residents. According to one resident, “I’d rather have them hire the right

manor woman for the job and keep replacing them than have the same moron for 20 years.” Another commented, “Your average dunderhead is not the person you want to try to solve a fight between a man and his wife at 2:00 a.m.” The ridicule got so bad that another city ran an ad asking, “Too smart to work for New London? Apply with us”; San Francisco police chief Fred Lau encouraged Jordan to apply to the San Francisco Police Department; and Tonight Show host Jay Leno rewrote the theme song for the television show Cops to include, “Dumb cops, dumb cops, whatcha gonna do with a low IQ.”

Jordan filed a lawsuit, but lost. The judge ruled, “Plaintiff may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.” 7

Do you agree with New London’s reasoning about being “too bright?”
