If you aren’t convinced that your organization needs to think more

deeply about its caregivers right now, consider this your wake-up call

to start proactively planning for the future. In a few years, the tsunami

of eldercare responsibilities employees will face as their Baby Boomer

parents and relatives age may be drowning them. According to the

U.S. Census, the 2030s will mark the ﬁrst time in U.S. history that the

number of people 65 and older will be more than people under 18. This

makes building up your company’s care infrastructure a smart business

decision to get the most out of a strong and diverse group of employees

today and for decades to come.
