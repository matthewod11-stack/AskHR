# HBR / Digital Article / Age Inclusion Is Your Company’s Next Competitive Advantage

This mindset is not only outdated but also contrary to market forces.

In the U.S., according to AARP, adults over 50 control nearly 70%

of household wealth. Globally, they account for 42% of consumer

spending. And, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor force

participation among people over 65 has nearly doubled since 2000,

outpacing all other age groups.

Some companies are waking up to this reality. Nike has made

moves to attract older consumers, including the development of new

product lines. Apple has quietly embedded inclusive features across

its devices, like large-text interfaces, fall detection, and even hearing

aid functionality, without singling out older users. Dove’s “Beauty

never gets old” campaign features women over 60 and reframes aging

as aspirational, challenging outdated beauty standards. The luxury

fashion brand Jacquemus’s recent advertising stars 67-year-old Jon

Gries, demonstrating the cultural power and credibility that older

celebrities bring to brands. Even Nestlé, better known for confections

and baby food, announced that it plans to diversify its product oﬀerings

to include older adults.

Yet these remain the exceptions, not the rule.
