# HYPOTHESES AND THEORY

In order to explore whether and to what extent employees perceive societal and workplace gender inequality to exist, it is first essential to define the meaning of gender equality. This study follows liberal feminist theory and sees gender equality as equal opportunities for men and women to realize their ambitions (Lehto, 1999). The problem of gender inequality is seen as a question of achieving sameness and the solution for overcoming it as a strategy of equal opportunities (Verloo and Lombardo, 2007). Furthermore, based on the model explaining individuals’ consciousness of gender inequality (Davis and Robinson, 1991: 72), those employees who are in favor of achieving sameness between men and women by providing both of them with equal opportunities are considered to perceive gender inequality to a greater extent than others.

Employees’ perceptions are influenced by the experiences they gain throughout their lives. A set of hypotheses concerning individual factors, which are suggested to have an impact on employees’ perceptions of both societal and workplace gender inequality are, thus, developed first. Employees’ perceptions of workplace gender inequality may also vary considerably across sectors, industries, and organizations since sectors, industries, and organizations may have their own distinctions of gender inequality with roots of discrimination deeply embedded in their systems, practices, and assumptions (Meyerson and Fletcher, 2000). Gender inequality in many workplaces can be obscured and reproduced by processes of disembodiment, such as ‘merit’ and productivity, which make it difficult for organizational members to recognize the persistence of male privilege and the absence of gender equality. Therefore, after introducing hypotheses concerning individual factors, I develop a set of hypotheses about employment factors, which are expected to have an impact on employees’ perceptions of workplace gender inequality.

In line with the previous empirical research, gender is suggested to be related to employees’ perceptions of both societal and workplace gender inequality (e.g., Borchorst and Siim, 2008). According to the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999), men and women
