Excluded from Table 1, and from the discussion in of basic ideas in section III, are a rapidly-emerging

variety of formal “dual system” models, drawing on old dichotomies in psychology. These models generally

retain optimization by one of the systems and make behavior of another system automatic (or myopic) and

nonstrategic, so that extensions of standard tools can be used. (Intuitively, think of part of the brain as

optimizing against a new type of constraint—an internal constraint from another brain system, rather than a

budget constraint or an external constraint from competition.) In Kahneman (2003) the systems are intuitive

and deliberative systems (“systems 1 and 2”). In Loewenstein and O’Donoghue, 2004) the systems are

deliberative and affective; in Benhabib and Bisin (2005) the systems are controlled and automatic; in Fudenberg

and Levine (2004) the systems are “long-run” (and controlling) and “short-run”; in Bernheim and Rangel

(2005) the systems are “hot” (automatic) and “cold”. In Brocas and Castillo (2005) a myopic “agent” system

has private information about utility, so a farsighted “principal” (who cares about the utility of all agents)

creates mechanisms for the myopic agents to reveal their information.

These models are more alike than they are different. In the years to come, careful thought will probably

sharpen our understanding of the similarities and differences among models. More thought will probably point

to more general formulations that include models like those above as special cases, narrowing the focus of

attention. And of course, empirical work is needed to see which predictions of different models hold up best,

presumably inspiring some refinements that might eventually lead to a single model which could occupy a
