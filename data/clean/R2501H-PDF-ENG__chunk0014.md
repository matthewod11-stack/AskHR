# Challengers

When CEOs want a learning leader who is less concerned with

upholding standards and more focused on developing innovative

capabilities, they often turn to a challenger. In contrast to custodians,

challengers embrace a humanistic belief that employees have an

intrinsic right to grow and forge their own paths and that the

organization must honor that right. While the organization beneﬁts

from learning because it helps employees raise the quality of their

work, challengers believe that the ultimate beneﬁciary must be the

individuals themselves, or learning will become oppressive.
