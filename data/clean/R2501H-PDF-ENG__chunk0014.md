## HBR / Magazine Article / Three Ways to Lead Learning

Challengers often consider learning to be a moral duty of the

organization rather than a ﬁnancial one. “I believe that education is the

way to help people grow personally and live a better life,” one told us.

Challengers tend to claim they have an “outsider” perspective

that diﬀers from the organization’s mainstream thinking. They see

themselves as valuable specialists who bring unique expertise to the C-

suite—often with learning-focused résumés. These leaders love telling

stories of their peers’ skepticism; friction with other senior leaders seems only to aﬃrm their view that most executives are champions

of the status quo who need redeeming rather than pleasing. That

reﬂects challengers’ perception that learning is valuable in helping

people defy norms and break habits that hold the company back. While

instrumental learning fosters convergence and alignment, humanistic

learning encourages divergence from a norm.

There are strong beneﬁts to the challenger approach. The ﬁrst is

engagement: A number of challengers we spoke to reported proudly that

employees they worked with had turned down higher-paid jobs oﬀered

by other companies, because they were afraid they would be made

to conform and would lose the freedom they enjoyed. The second is

innovation: Liberated, energized people are more likely to come up with

new ways to do things. They can adapt global policies to local cultures.

They do not wait for instructions to seize an opportunity or respond to

a market turn. Most important, they are the restless, tinkering, internal

champions of change that Clay Christensen believed were necessary in

established companies, lest disruptive innovation from nimbler ﬁrms

ﬁnd them unprepared. It’s perhaps ironic that while challengers report

caring less about retention than custodians do, by making employees

feel their skills are more portable, they improve it.
