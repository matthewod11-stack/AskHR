# Easing the Daily-Chore Burden

With work, child-care, and elder-care responsibilities, many employees find it increasingly difficult to complete such basic chores as going to the dentist, get- ting the car inspected, and picking up dry cleaning. As a result, organizations have implemented a variety of strategies to ease this burden. Popular among these are increasing the use of flexible working hours, increasing the number of paid personal days off, and providing essential services on-site.

By providing essential services on-site, employers assume that employees will work more hours because they will not have to take time away from work to com- plete common chores. For example, Analytical Graphics of Exton, Pennsylvania, provides its employees with free on-site breakfasts, lunches, and dinners so that employees don’t have to leave the building to eat. Not only do employees feel appreciated and save money, but the company gets an additional – minutes of work out of them each day because they can eat while they work.

To ease the daily-chore burden, % of organizations provide concierge services for their employees (SHRM, a). For a cost between $ and $, per employee per year, these services will perform such tasks as making restaurant reservations, ordering flowers, having food delivered, scheduling car repairs, picking up dry cleaning, and having a person wait at an employee’s home for service calls to repair appliances or conduct other business (Taylor, ). Examples of concierge services include Les Concierges, Best Upon Request, Circles, and Time Savers (see the Employment Profile box).

To make shopping easier for employees, Microsoft, M, and Northwest Air- lines allow employees to use their computers at work to buy discounted products and services. Thus, employees can purchase a variety of products including gro- ceries and movie tickets without leaving the office. Employees get the benefit of lower prices and ease of shopping, and employers get the benefit of employees working longer hours.
