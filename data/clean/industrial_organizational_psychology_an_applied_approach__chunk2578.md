I am the owner and president

of Square Peg Consulting, Inc., an organization and training development consulting company. My primary goal is to work with clients to improve the effectiveness of their organizations. I use a whole-systems approach to organization development (OD), focusing on organization alignment as the key to organization effectiveness. A systems approach includes viewing the organization as a living organism, influenced by external and internal elements. There is a cause-and-effect relationship between each element, and organizations are most effective when all the systems within it align. My approach to enabling organizations to better perform is to assess alignment gaps and opportunities and develop interventions that align

resources, systems, and processes to better position the organization to achieve business results. Because organizations grow and evolve through their natural organizational life cycle, it is important that they continue to shift and realign themselves to ensure that all their efforts are going in the same direction for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.

One important element of organizational effectiveness is communication. From a diagnostic perspective, one can tell much about an organization’s culture from assessing both what and how communication is shared throughout the organization. For example, if an organization claims to have a culture of “empowerment,” yet e mployees are not aware of the organization’s goals or vision, there is a potential gap between leadership’s intention and the reality in which employees live. As a result, dysfunctional behavior may occur, leading to mistrust and poor performance. Confusion and dissatisfaction

arise when an organization’s communication and governance practices are incongruent with the culture it espouses. For instance, a company aspiring to engage employees in the business while restricting employee access to information about its

financial performance may be viewed cynically by employees. A company proclaiming to trust and empower employees while limiting delegation of authority may be perceived as disingenuous.
