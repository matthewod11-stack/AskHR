## professionalism, follow-through, and emotional maturity day after day.

Be present and more attuned to your tone in meetings, show up

prepared, and stay steady under pressure. Small acts such as responding

promptly, supporting your boss’s priorities, and contributing solutions

will create a new narrative about you over time. Don’t force closeness

or expect instant warmth; focus instead on reliability and respect. Let

your actions quietly but clearly say: You can count on me. That’s how

reputations are repaired and relationships are renewed.

. . .

Alex has been slowly rebuilding trust with his boss over the past few

weeks. When she rejected another one of his ideas in a meeting, Alex

waited until their 1:1 to be curious and dive deeper into the reason

behind the rejection. Instead of reacting defensively, he listened. He

asked questions. He focused on the relationship, not just the outcome.

Repairing a rupture with your boss will happen quicker if you can show

that you’ve learned from it and demonstrate those learnings the next

time a situation arises. Alex showed emotional control, humility, and

the courage to keep showing up, even when the relationship still felt

tenuous. Everyone makes mistakes at work. What deﬁnes your career

isn’t the mistake itself. It’s how you respond, and how you rebuild.
