### **[The competitive reality]{.underline}**

[Organizations running effective hybrid teams are already pulling ahead.
McKinsey\'s analysis of early adopters found that companies with
well-functioning hybrid teams show 31% higher productivity and 23%
better quality metrics than traditional teams (McKinsey,
2024).]{.underline}

[But they\'re not just doing things faster --- they\'re doing things
that weren\'t possible before. The combination of human creativity and
AI computation, human judgment and AI consistency, human empathy and AI
scalability creates genuinely new capabilities.]{.underline}

[American Express, for example, uses hybrid teams in fraud detection
where AI agents process millions of transactions while human experts
handle complex patterns and evolving fraud tactics. This combination
caught 23% more fraud with 45% fewer false positives than either
approach alone (American Express, 2024).]{.underline}
