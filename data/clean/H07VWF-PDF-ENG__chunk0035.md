# For employers, managers, and leaders.

As decision-makers, you have the power to push for policies that allow

all new parents to take parental leave — and the power to initiate the

cultural shift necessary to encourage men to take advantage of parental

leave entitlements. Take parental leave yourself, tell others about your

brain training, and set an example for other new dads to do the same.

If parental leave wasn’t an option for you when you had kids, join the

voices of other men who regret their lack of leave by advocating for

better policies for today’s new dads.
