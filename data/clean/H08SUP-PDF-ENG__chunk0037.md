## Focus on committee process, not just outcomes. Eï¬€ective committee

decision-making depends not only on who is in the room, but on

whether the meeting structure encourages members to contribute

their knowledge fully. A key insight from our research is that how

meetings are run (especially the incentives embedded in procedures

like voting protocols) shapes how deeply members engage, share private

information, and seek out diverse perspectives. Too often, organizations

focus on the decision outcome while overlooking the mechanics that

produce it. This leads to focus on achieving consensus and moving on.

But sustainable decision quality hinges on creating protocols that lower

barriers to contribution and encourage learning.
