# 28 Psychology as a Profession

education, although today one can hear the terms “profes- sion” and “job” as nearly interchangeable. However, the hall- marks of a profession are still commonly understood to be specialized education, exchange of information (e.g., through journals, books, seminars), accepted standards of practice, and governmental certiﬁcation and/or licensing.

How psychologists achieved the status of professional is discussed in this chapter, as we explore historical develop- ments, organizational efforts, educational criteria, relations with other professions, and brief histories of its major sub- specialties. More detailed histories of the specialties can be found in the relevant chapters in the volume. Also, the role of organizations of the profession is presented in the last chapter of the book.
