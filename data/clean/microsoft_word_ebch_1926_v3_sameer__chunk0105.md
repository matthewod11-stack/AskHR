Employees may have sufficient experience or little experience when they are hired. Employees must participate in a training and development programme after being recruited and chosen. The program's length might range from two to fifteen days.

Through this programme, they must acquire the necessary knowledge and advance their skills and abilities so they may make a crucial contribution to the accomplishment of both organisational and individual goals. Development and training are closely related. People are able to bring about progress in a variety of areas with the acquisition of suitable instruction. It is crucial to concentrate on employee training and development if any organisation is to succeed in this cutthroat business environment. Organisations are expected to determine the employees' training needs and create the programmes. It is critical to concentrate on the areas that require improvement when planning the programmes. The areas that need to be recognised are those that the staff members are unfamiliar with. The most effective workforce utilisation for goal actualization and objective attainment should be taken into account while creating programmes. Employees exchange knowledge and skills with one another in order for them to not only execute their jobs effectively but also to advance their professional development[1], [2].

Training and development are crucial aspects of organizational growth and employee advancement. These processes encompass a range of activities designed to enhance the skills, knowledge, and abilities of employees within an organization. Effective training equips employees with the tools and expertise needed to excel in their current roles, while also preparing them for future responsibilities. Moreover, it contributes to increased job satisfaction and employee retention. Development, on the other hand, focuses on nurturing employees' long- term potential by providing opportunities for career progression and personal growth. Organizations that invest in comprehensive training and development programs often experience improved productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. These initiatives can take various forms, including workshops, mentoring, online courses, and on-the-job training, tailored to meet specific organizational needs and individual employee goals. In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, where skills and knowledge quickly become obsolete, ongoing training and development are not just advantageous but imperative for organizational success and sustainability[3], [4].
