# 2. Intrinsic Motivation

Intrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from within. It comes from the

personal enjoyment and educational achievement that we derive from doing that

particular thing. For example for people who love music, their motivation to practice the

instrument, attend classes etc, is intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is crucial in

today's work environment. Research shows that it is a key factor in performance and

innovation. At a personal level, intrinsic motivation makes your work fulfilling. It's a

major reason for deciding to stay on a job. It helps keep your stress level down.
