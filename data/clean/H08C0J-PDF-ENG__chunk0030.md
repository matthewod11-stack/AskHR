# Develop and Deploy Early-Warning Systems

The importance of timely information cannot be overstated when it

comes to climate change and employee health. Preventing an issue is far

more eﬀective than treating its consequences. For example, an email,

text, or app notice in advance of poor air quality can protect those with

chronic conditions such as asthma. Just as companies have systems to

warn of immediate security threats, similar early-warning systems are

needed for the growing public-health risks linked to climate change.
