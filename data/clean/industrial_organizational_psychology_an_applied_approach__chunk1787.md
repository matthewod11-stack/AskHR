# Chapter Summary

In this chapter you learned: 7 7

The use of -degree feedback is increasing. There are five steps in creating a performance appraisal system: () determine the reasons for performance evaluation, () create an instrument to evaluate performance, () explain the system to those who will use it, () evaluate employee performance, and () review the results of the evaluation with the employee. Common rating errors such as leniency, central tendency, strictness, halo, proximity, contrast, recency, and infrequent observation of behavior hinder the accuracy of performance appraisal results. Important factors in the success of the performance appraisal review include scheduling the review to eliminate or minimize interruptions, letting the employee discuss her feelings and thoughts, and mutually setting goals for improvements in future performance. In organizations not subject to employment-at-will, employees can be terminated only for violating a company rule or inability to perform or as part of a force reduction.
