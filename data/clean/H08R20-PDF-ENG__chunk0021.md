## Leadership Happens in Your Next Interaction

“Relationships are my job,” Tanya told me at the end of the day.

“Everything else, including quality, follows.”

For leaders at all levels, the quality of the outcomes you get from people

is usually determined by the quality of your relationships with them.

Quality relationships start with quality interactions, and feeling seen

in these interactions can predict feelings of trust, the foundation of

high-performing teams. Take the time to ensure every interaction you

have begins and ends with noticing the people around you.
