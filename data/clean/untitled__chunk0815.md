# Spearman’s Two-Factor Theory

Spearman (1904, 1927) proposed a two-factor theory of in- telligence, a theory that is still very much alive and well today (e.g., Brand, 1996; Jensen, 1998). The theory posits a general factor (g) common to all tasks requiring intelligence and one speciﬁc factor (s) unique to each different type of task. Thus, there are two types of factors rather than, strictly speaking, two factors.

Spearman (1904) got this idea as a result of looking at data processed by a statistical technique of his own invention, namely, factor analysis, which attempts to identify latent sources of individual (or other) differences that underlie ob- served sources of variation in test performance. Spearman observed that when he factor-analyzed a correlation matrix, the two kinds of factors appeared—the general factor com- mon to all of the tests and the speciﬁc factors unique to each particular test.

Spearman (1927) admitted to not being sure what the psy- chological basis of g is but suggested that it might be mental energy (a term that he never deﬁned very clearly). Whatever it was, it was a unitary and primary source of individual dif- ferences in intelligence-test performance.
