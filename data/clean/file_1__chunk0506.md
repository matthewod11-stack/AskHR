Using the university records data on the whole sample, we performed an analysis of missing data using paired t-tests comparing the means of respondents and non- respondents with regard to gender, prior monthly pay level, and pay changes (i.e., level of pay increases and proportion of pay guarantee). No statistically significant differences emerged in any of these comparisons, thereby alleviating concerns that our respondents may have differed on relevant dimensions as compared to non- respondents. However, due to the missing information in some of the responses, the effective sample size for regression analyses is N=455.
