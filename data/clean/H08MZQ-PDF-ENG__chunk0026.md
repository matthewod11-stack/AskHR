# Build inclusive development pathways.

One of my earliest experiences of discrimination at work was being told

that professional development was only available to men. My merit and

performance did not matter. It was that disregard for merit that ignited

my passion for creating fair talent development systems—systems that

are both merit-based and inclusive. In truly fair systems, organizations

nurture the potential of all employees. This means making all aspects

of career development, from onboarding and networking to leadership

development pipelines, inclusive of the full range of talent. It requires

expanding the narrow deﬁnitions of potential that currently exclude
