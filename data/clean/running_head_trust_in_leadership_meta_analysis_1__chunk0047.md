# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

difficult or uncertain situations, followers should feel that they can rely on servant leaders to

prioritize their welfare over organisational objectives, thus signalling affective trust and

benevolent intent (e.g., Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). Empirically, links between these moral

approaches and trust have been found as summarised in recent meta-analytical work (Banks

et al., 2016; Bedi et al., 2016; Hoch et al., 2018).

Other contemporary styles may also be important. For example, empowering

leadership has been found to elicit trust (Huang et al., 2010). Empowering leadership is

defined as promoting followers’ self-directed and autonomous decision making, the giving

and sharing of information, delegating authority and inviting input from followers (e.g.,

Kirkman & Rosen, 1999). Leaders who empower subordinates, providing them discretion and

latitude over decision making, make themselves vulnerable and demonstrate confidence; key

features of trust (Zhang & Zhou, 2014). Essentially, such empowering behaviours

demonstrate to followers that the leader trusts them and followers are likely to reciprocate by

trusting their leaders in return (Ferrin et al., 2008; Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2015; Seppälä et

al., 2011).

Paternalistic leadership is a style that comprises of authority and discipline as well as

care and concern for followers and is conceptualised as three dimensions: authoritarianism,

morality, and benevolence (Farh & Cheng, 2000). Trust in the leader has been found to

mediate the relationship between the morality and benevolence dimensions of paternalistic

leadership and follower behaviour (Chen et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2012). The moral and

benevolent dimensions are typically theorised to encourage follower reciprocation of positive

leader behaviour leading to the development of trust over time (e.g., Chen et al., 2014).

Specifically, positive and trustworthy leader behaviour encourages a shift from economic to

social-exchange (Blau, 1964) suggesting that trust in the leader may explain the positive

effects of leader morality and benevolence on followers’ behaviour. Authoritarian leadership,
