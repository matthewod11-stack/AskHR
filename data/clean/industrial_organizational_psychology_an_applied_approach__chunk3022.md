# Group Ability and Conﬁ dence

Not surprisingly, groups consisting of high-ability members outperform those with low-ability members (Devine & Phillips, ). Furthermore, groups whose members believe that their team can be successful both at a specific task (high team efficacy) and at tasks in general (high team potency) perform better than groups whose members aren’t as confident about their probability for success (Gully, Incalcaterra, Joshi, & Beaubien, ).
