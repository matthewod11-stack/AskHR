Initial Response (factual & neutral): "I found a highly-rated sushi restaurant nearby. It's

called Sakura Sushi, located at 123 Main Street. It has a 4.7-star rating and is open until 10

PM. Would you like me to start navigation?"

After rephrasing (playful style): "Sushi craving? Say no more! Head over to Sakura Sushi

at 123 Main Street, where the fish is fresh and the soy sauce flows freely! Rated 4.7 stars,

open till 10 PM. Ready for an umami adventure?‚Äù
