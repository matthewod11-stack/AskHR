Executives are exhausted from the ongoing search for growth. If your

team spends its time tactically eking out revenue increases, it’s time

to step back and understand the power of a growth system. Great

innovation can create the next market, and great insights will uncover

new opportunities. Companies should not and cannot wait for markets

to be deﬁned or disrupted. Even when products and services become

outdated, the system’s capabilities can be extended or repurposed to

shape and transform your future.
