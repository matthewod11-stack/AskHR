# A PERSONAL HISTORY

My own development was shaped by a series of experiences. I was invited to the National Asian American Psychology Training Conference in 1976, an experience which forever molded my own identity. I cannot express how powerful it was to walk into a room and be surrounded not only by peo- ple who all looked like me in being Asian Americans, but who were also all psychologists! Deep in my heart, it felt like a homecoming—an emotion of enormous importance as it shaped my future.

Two events motivated me to pursue higher ofﬁce in APA governance. First, I was elected president of the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy (AABT) in 1993. The next event was an encounter at an executive committee meeting of the APA Division 45, the Society for the Psycho- logical Study of Ethnic Minority Issues. A past president of the Division encouraged me to be a candidate for the APA presidency.

I ran three consecutive years, barely losing the ﬁrst time by about 16 votes I decided to use a third try as a “tie breaker” and to live with its results. As fortune would have it, I became the 107th president of APA, the third ethnic minority, and the ﬁrst Asian American.
