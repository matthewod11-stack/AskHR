# Minimizing Rater Errors

Developing the ability to define appropriate criteria for the behav- iors being evaluated, a standard or average performance against which employees may be compared 37

James Buford and Sony a Collins add that the workshop method is an excellent way

to train raters to reduce errors:

Trainees should have the opportunity to observe errors being made in an appraisal conference if possible. Videotapes are effective and can be used repeatedly. Raters should at least review written situational exercises. They should attempt to identify the errors that are being made and then complete their own ratings. Through group discussion, trainees have the opportunity to receive feedback regarding their on rating behavior and practice the correct techniques.3s

Latham and Wex ley have described in detail an excellent workshop employing the kind of videotaped exercises recommended by Buford and Collins.;') Administrators would do well to review the Latham and Wexley program when devising their own training sessions Another useful training device is the Atlantic Richfield Company's guide for individual raters 40

Exhibit 6.2 contains a detailed training outline which was devised to facilitate the implementation of a BARS-type faculty evaluation instrument in a university' setting.'' Research with this training program found it to be very effective in minimizing rater errors.42

The implications of this section should be very , lear. Tram y our raters if you want to minimize errors in observing and appraising performance. Providing a comprehen- sive rate' i:aining program is probably the most important step in implementing an effective appraisal system Time and energy invested in rater training w ill pay huge dividends in terms of the accuracy of the data resulting from the appraisal process.

- 6. Provide opportunities for the raters to observe the performance being appraised.

In an earlier section of this chapter administrators were advised to select raters who are in a position to observe the performance in question However, simply being in position to observe is not enough, as the following passage illustrates.

Supervisors meeting informally over coffee or lunch frequently brag about and share amusing anecdotes regarding their employees' behavior and work per- formance As they do this, the supers isois are actually informally evaluating their employees, often on the basis of a few randomly observed events or remarks. . It is during these infoonal, loosely structured discussions that ei dloyees In the absence of more accu- rate data regarding employee work performance, decisiou, might typically
