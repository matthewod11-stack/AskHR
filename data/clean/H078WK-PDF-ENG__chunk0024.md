because of systemic structures that have historically limited access and opportunity. To build up a pipeline of diverse talent, tradeoﬀs need to

be built into the strategy.

Leaders must acknowledge these disparities and realize it will take

and time and sacriﬁces to ﬁx it. If an organization is committed to

increasing their diversity of leadership, they may have to keep a position

open longer than expected to identify a diverse slate of candidates.

They may have to recruit outside of their typical top schools. They

may have to reevaluate if the requirements they have always had for

the job (such as a bachelor’s degree) are actually indicators of success.

They may even have to consider nontraditional candidates who have

had career success in other industries or business functions. Leadership

teams must explicitly create opportunities for the DEI strategy to be implemented. This will always require tradeoﬀs.

Weaver is vocal about her willingness to embrace the tradeoﬀs in order

to build the most diverse team: “I would keep a position open for two

years before I put the wrong person in it. I can tell you, if we were,

for instance, to fall to 40% women in team members, I would hold

those positions open for women, because I want their percentages in my

company to match that of America.”

Pitfall 4: A belief that diverse cultures do not need explicit DEI initiatives.

Achieving demographic diversity, as Uncle Nearest has, doesn’t obviate

the need for DEI programs. You need to continue to build that culture
