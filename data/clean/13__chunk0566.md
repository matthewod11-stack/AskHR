## Cognitive, Affective, and Cultural Inﬂuences on Stigmatization

homogeneous than ingroup members, and (c) as different than the self and other ingroup members on various dimensions (e.g., Mackie & Hamilton, 1993; Macrae et al., 1996; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1993). Interestingly, however, negative cognitions about or feelings toward outgroup members do not always result in self-reports of beliefs or attitudes that are consistent with such cognitions or feelings. One reason for this is that egalitarian norms inhibit the public expression of attitudes or beliefs that suggest that an observer has biased or prejudicial views of others (e.g., Crosby, Bromley, & Saxe, 1980; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1993; Fiske & Ruscher, 1993).

Threat Evoked by the Target. Observers may use extant stereotypes as a basis for inferring the degree of threat that a target poses to the welfare of both the observer and the groups to which he or she belongs (Fiske & Ruscher, 1993; Lazarus, 1966, 1991; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Lazarus et al., 1980). For example, if a job applicant bears the mark of being ‘‘mentally ill,’’ an interviewer (who also is responsible for making a hiring decision) may infer that he or she is unstable, overly emotional, and unpredictable, to the welfare of both the interviewer and his or her organization. This mark may result from the applicant having a relatively low score on a measure of emotional stability, one of the dimensions of measures that are based on the Big Five conception of personality. Having knowledge of the same score, the observer then considers his or her ability to cope successfully with the threat posed by it (Lazarus, 1966, 1991; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Lazarus et al., 1980). For instance, the interviewer can cope with the threat by either (a) not hiring the applicant or (b) hiring the applicant, but assigning him or her to a job involving minimal contact with others, especially the interviewer. (Note that this cognitive appraisal perspective is explained below.)

thus posing a threat

Emotional Responses to the Target A target’s ASI serves as the basis for the observer’s affective or emotional reactions (Arrows 17, and the path associated with Arrows 16 and 18), which are often tied to the target’s social category (e.g., Bodenhausen & Macrae, 1996; Fiske et al., 2002; Kurzban & Leary, 2001; Heatherton et al., 2003). In order to avoid conceptual confusion, we next provide deﬁnitions of the overlapping concepts of affect and emotion.

Emotions. Cognition-arousal theory views emotions as the byproduct of physiological arousal and cognitions about its causes (Leventhal & Tomarken,
