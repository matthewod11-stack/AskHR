Creating partnerships.

When it comes to protecting the health of their employees from the

risks posed by climate change, companies don’t have to go it alone.

Teaming up with experts from hospitals or public health organizations

can provide the specialized knowledge and guidance needed to develop

eﬀective, long-term strategies. These collaborations help companies

tackle the nitty-gritty details of their plans, from ﬁguring out the

most-eﬀective approaches and estimating costs over multiple years, to

assessing what’s realistic and how to make the programs stick. Plus,

they send a powerful message to workers and the wider community that

a company is prioritizing people’s well-being and taking meaningful

action to address the challenges ahead.
