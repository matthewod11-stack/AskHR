# Importance of Job Analysis

A thorough job analysis is the foundation for almost all human resources activi- ties. It is diﬃ cult to imagine how one could write a job description, select employ- ees, evaluate performance, or conduct training programs without knowing the tasks an employee performs, the conditions under which they are performed, and the competencies needed to perform the tasks. A thorough job analysis provides such information.

Writing Job Descriptions One of the written products of a job analysis is a job description—a brief, two- to ﬁ ve-page summary of the tasks and job requirements found in the job analysis. In other words, the job analysis is the process of determining the work activities and requirements, and the job description is the written result of the job analysis. Job analyses and job descriptions serve as the basis for many HR activities, including employee selection, evaluation, training, and work design.

Employee Selection It is diﬃ cult to imagine how an employee can be selected unless there is a clear understanding of the tasks performed and the competencies needed to perform those tasks. By identifying such requirements, it is possible to select tests or develop interview questions that will determine whether a particular applicant possesses the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to carry out the require- ments of the job. Although this seems like common sense, the discussion of the unstructured employment interview in Chapter  demonstrates that many

non–job-related variables are often used to select employees. Examples are height requirements for police oﬃ cers, ﬁ rm handshakes for most jobs, and physi- cal attractiveness for airline ﬂ ight attendants.

Training Again, it is diﬃ cult to see how employees can be trained unless the requirements of the job are known. Job analyses yield lists of job activities that can be system- atically used to create training programs.

Personpower Planning One important but seldom employed use of job analysis is to determine worker mobility within an organization. Th at is, if individuals are hired for a particular job, to what other jobs can they expect to eventually be promoted and become success- ful? Many organizations have a policy of promoting the person who performs the best in the job immediately below the one in question. Although this approach has its advantages, it can result in the so-called Peter Principle: promoting employees until they eventually reach their highest level of incompetence (Peter & Hull, ). For example, consider an employee who is the best salesperson in the company. Even though this person is known to be excellent in sales, it is not known what type of supervisor he or she will be. Promotion solely on the basis of sales perfor- mance does not guarantee that the individual will do well as a supervisor. Suppose, however, that job analysis results are used to compare all jobs in the company to the supervisor’s job. Instead of promoting the person in the job immediately below the supervisor, we promote the best employee from the most similar job—that is, a job that already involves much of the same knowledge, skills, and abilities as the supervisor’s job. With this approach, there is a better match between the person being promoted and the requirements of the job.

Performance Appraisal Another important use of job analysis is the construction of a performance appr- aisal instrument. As in employee selection, the evaluation of employee performance must be job related. Employees are often evaluated with forms that use such vague categories as “dependability,” “knowledge,” and “initiative.” Th e use of speciﬁ c, job- related categories leads to more accurate performance appraisals that are better accepted not only by employees but also by the courts (Werner & Bolino, ). In addition, when properly administered and utilized, job-related performance appraisals can serve as an excellent source of employee training and counseling.

Job Classifi cation Job analysis enables a human resources professional to classify jobs into groups based on similarities in requirements and duties. Job classiﬁ cation is useful for determining pay levels, transfers, and promotions.

Job Evaluation Job analysis information can also be used to determine the worth of a job. Job evaluation will be discussed in greater detail later in this chapter.

Job Design Job analysis information can be used to determine the optimal way in which a job should be performed. Th at is, what would be the best way for an employee to

sit at her computer or what would be the best way for a warehouse person to lift boxes? By analyzing a job, wasted and unsafe motions can be eliminated, resulting in higher productivity and reduced numbers of job injuries. A job design was mentioned in Chapter  with the example of Frank Gilbreth, who, after studying the inconsistency with which brick masons did their work, was able to reduce the number of motions needed to lay a brick from  to ½.

Compliance with Legal Guidelines As will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter , any employment decision must be based on job-related information. One legally acceptable way to directly determine job relatedness is by job analysis. No law speciﬁ cally requires a job analysis, but several important guidelines and court cases mandate job analysis for all practical purposes.

First, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures ()—the HR principles designed to ensure compliance with federal standards—contain several direct references to the necessity of job analysis. Even though the Uniform Guidelines are not law, courts have granted them “great deference” (Brannick, Levine, & Morgeson, ).

Second, several court cases have discussed the concept of job relatedness. For example, in Griggs v. Duke Power (), employment decisions were based in part upon applicants’ possession of a high school diploma. Because a higher per- centage of blacks than whites did not meet this requirement, smaller percentages of blacks were hired and promoted. Th us, a suit was ﬁ led against the Duke Power Company charging that a high school diploma was not necessary to carry out the demands of the job. Th e court agreed with Griggs, the plaintiﬀ , stating that the company had indeed not established the job relatedness of the high school diploma requirement.

Although not speciﬁ cally mentioning the term job analysis, the decision in Griggs was the ﬁ rst to address the issue of job relatedness. Subsequent cases such as Albermarle v. Moody () and Chance v. Board of Examiners () further established the necessity of job relatedness and the link between it and job analysis.

Organizational Analysis During the course of their work, job analysts often become aware of certain prob- lems within an organization. For example, during a job analysis interview, an employee may indicate that she does not know how she is evaluated or to whom she is supposed to report. Th e discovery of such lapses in organizational com- munication can then be used to correct problems and help an organization function better. For example, while conducting job analysis interviews of credit union positions, job analyst Deborah Peggans discovered that none of the work- ers knew how their job performances were evaluated. Th is let the organization know it had not done an adequate job of communicating performance standards to its employees.
