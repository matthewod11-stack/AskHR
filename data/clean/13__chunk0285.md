# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we proposed that the mixed ﬁndings of past diversity research necessitate an explicit consideration of contextual variables. While several researchers have called for the inclusion of contextual variables in diversity research, there remains less of an understanding of the overall scope and nature of the diversity context. Contextual considerations in diversity research are critical for maintaining the market orientation of our research and demand innovative theoretical and methodological tools. From a theoretical standpoint, greater efforts to link micro–macro theory would be valuable to take into consideration how omnibus as well as discrete contextual factors could independently as well as jointly shape diversity- related outcomes. Methodologically, qualitative research would enhance the sensitivity of diversity research to omnibus and discrete contextual variables. We join others (e.g., Johns, 2006; Rousseau & Fried, 2001) to propose that
