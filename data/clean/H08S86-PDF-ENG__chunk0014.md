# Minimization of Disruption

The appointment of a new CEO is a major disruptive event for any

company regardless of the reason for the CEO change. The beginning of

a calendar or ﬁscal year presents a natural breakpoint to interrupt the

work of organizational members. Synchronizing a new CEO succession

with the beginning of the calendar or ﬁscal year allows enough time

for organizational members to regain focus and attention on tasks and

projects before results are expected, thus reducing disruptive eﬀects

associated with CEO succession.
