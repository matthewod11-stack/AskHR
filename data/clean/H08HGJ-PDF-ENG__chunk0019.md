## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Reimagine Scale

maintain the machines. Work that is segmented and specialized like

that described in the pin factory has been or will be automated by

machines or AI. Work that is robust against replacement by automation

like AI is diﬀerentiated, cross-functional, and integrative.

Second, because Smith never visited the factory, he never thought

through the tradeoﬀs involved when we mechanize people through

specialization. Smith’s contemporary, Adam Ferguson, did worry about

what happens when we down-skill people and treat them like machines.

In his essay, “The History of Civil Society,” he wrote about the

downsides: “many parts in the practice of every art, and in the detail

of every department, require no abilities, or actually tend to contract

and to limit the views of the mind.” Not only do these people lose

the very thing that diﬀerentiates them from machines — creativity,

integrative thinking, etc. — but they make themselves more vulnerable

to replacement, and more dissatisﬁed. In the opening of Studs Terkel’s

respected ethnography Working, Terkel states, “This book, being about

work, is, by its very nature, about violence — to the spirit as well as to

the body.” I had a ﬂashback to a recent taxi ride in San Francisco. As

we passed a Waymo self-driving taxi, the driver mumbled, “Well, there’s

my replacement.” What happens when a generation of people who have

down-skilled to become drivers are replaced?

Third, although scale undoubtedly produces beneﬁts in some

circumstances, when do we need to look beyond scale to other metrics

of success? Critics of scaling have pointed out that exaggerated returns

to scale are often used to bulldoze other valuable outcomes like well-

being. As Sir John has pointed out elsewhere about Adam Smith,

“There is little evidence that bigger plants produced marked increases

in productivity. [Smith’s claims] would not be the last time in which
