## Eﬀective communication about change also isn’t one-size-ﬁts-all. Tailor

it to resonate with diﬀerent motivational styles. At Debora’s ﬁnancial

as a frontrunner in the industry” (Play to Win); “If we don’t implement

these changes, we risk falling out of compliance, losing our trusted

position with regulators and clients, and endangering our reputation
