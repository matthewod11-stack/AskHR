# Chapter Summary

In this chapter you learned: 7

Employees who have high self-esteem, a high need for achievement, and intrinsic motivation and who are expected to perform well by others are more motivated than their counterparts with low self-esteem and low achievement need who are extrinsically motivated. Goals are most effective if they are concrete and specific, are of high but reasonable difficulty, and are set with the input of the employee. Providing feedback on goal attainment and performance levels will increase performance. Operant conditioning principles can be used to motivate employees. It is important to treat employees fairly. Common individual incentive plans include pay for performance and merit pay. Common organizational incentive plans include profit sharing, gainsharing, and stock options.
