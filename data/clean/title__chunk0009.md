## Organizations should know their people: A behavioral economics approach — 45/48

the responder, using the strategy method, they would have to decide in advance whether they accept or reject each of the possible offers (Mitzkewitz and Nagel 1993).

The dictator game is identical to the ultimatum game with the exception that the second player is passive, so that the pro- poser’s (here labeled as “dictator”) offer is implemented for sure. The simplicity of this game allows to use it, for instance, to elicit the individuals’ beliefs about the average generosity of different groups of participants (corresponding to the afore- mentioned three types of matching) and even to provide the decision maker with the name of the recipient, which allows to examine which departments and individuals are seen as less generous and which ones receive less generosity from others. The amount of information obtained with this assessment is indeed exceptional. Both individualized and aggregate anal- yses can be carried out. Therefore, many variables can enter the equation (note that variables such as the participant’s gen- der, age, experience, position, type of contract and earnings need also to be accounted for and have to be collected ei- ther during the experiment or from the company’s previous data). However, this fact may also imply that the statistics are complex and strong econometric skills might thus be re- quired. Especially in these cases, it is important to note that, while exploratory analyses need to be performed, theory- and evidence-based hypotheses must drive the data analysis.

Conclusion We have delineated some potential avenues for the use of a behavioral economics approach for the evaluation and man- agement of people within organizations, with applications for both the private and public sector. Hopefully, these lines stimulate further research on the areas where the evidence is still scarce.

To the best of our knowledge the supply of behavioral eco- nomics assessments for companies is very limited. Although there is increasing demand, the experience so far suggests that one of the main problems to sell this type of services (apart from the obvious entry barriers) is that managers, even within HR departments, are not familiar with the methodology and are thus reticent to apply it. However, now widely-used measurements such as cognitive skills and personality traits also found similar obstacles some years ago. We are thus optimistic that the current obstacles will decrease in the near future once more and more companies take the ﬁrst step in applying behavioral economics methods to the assessment of their employees’ attitudes.

Regarding possible policy implications, we can offer sev- eral insights. Governments might encourage public and pri- vate employment agencies to assess the characteristics of the (to be) employees not only in order to facilitate companies to hire the appropriate workers, but also to help employees to develop their careers toward the sector or level that is better suited to their characteristics. Public employment policy may beneﬁt from these practices.

Another key insight for public policy might be obtained

from assessing the preferences of the public servants in differ- ent institutions (e.g. city councils or regional governments) and analyze which are the variables that distinguish corrupt from non-corrupt institutions, over-indebted from balanced- accounting ones, etc. This would help solve these important problems through a systematic knowledge of their origin.
