## 7.3.4.3 Leadership, Simplicity, and Mission Statements

Thinking about coordination and cognitive economy may help explain the nature of

leadership and language in companies. A striking feature of corporate talk is that

it is highly simplified, but catchy. “Maximize profit” is not an inspiring mission

statement. Instead, companies have slogans like “Quality is job 1” (Ford), “Just do

it” (Nike) “Do no evil” (Google), “Copy EXACTLY!” (intel, to maximize transfer

of wafer-production processes from old plants to new ones) and “Flatter the novice:

reward the expert driver” (Mustang cars). The Ritz—Carlton hotel chain supposedly

has a rule that up to $2,000 can be spent to solve a guest’s problem. The figure

$2,000 is useful for two reasons: it is around number that’s memorable; and it is a

surprisingly large number, a “put your money where your mouth is” signal of the

Ritz’s commitment to luxury hotel quality.

Why are these stated goals so simple? One explanation is that meta-principles

which help workers coordinate on equilibrium workplace norms have to be applied

to a broad range of different microgames. The principles have to be made commonly

known, and repeated over many years and between many workers without linguistic

degradation. Heath and Seidel (2004) suggest some good properties of “language

(facts about the world and a distillation of episodic memories). Corporate narratives harness the power

of episodic memory. Narratives often involve drama, humor, and emotion as well, which provides added

“depth of processing” that enhances their memorability. From a neural point of view these may provide a

kind of engineering redundancy because memory is then supported by multiple interconnected systems:

Who did it? How did it feel? When did it happen? From the brain’s point of view, a story may therefore

be simultaneously stored in different locations which are associated, improving retrieval.

!7Facial recognition is a very special kind of object recognition with dedicated neural circuitry (the

facial fusiform area, FFA), which suggests that there may be some cognitive advantages to organizing
