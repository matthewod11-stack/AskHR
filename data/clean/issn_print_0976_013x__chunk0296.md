reconfiguration allied performance measures but are limited at the system level. Although

digital tools can automate and integrating the supply chain as a system of systems and enable

better transparency, the sophistication level required for incorporating everything from a

spreadsheet to the dynamic integrated system of several players, capabilities as well as

robotics and Industry 4.0 enabled technologies to inspect, report, sense and adaptive response

initiation makes the whole picture rather complex.

Skilled expertise is required to excel in maximum aspects, i.e., multi-tasking and multi-field

experts of the integrated process as a system to interpret data and allied response triggering

mechanisms to maintain a competitive edge under several complex considerations.

Innovation and dynamic network capabilities practices to maintain a competitive edge are

getting tougher daily. Such complex analysis requires the integration and collaboration of

critical thinking and Industry 4.0 smart practices, an essence of Industry 5.0, to improve

responsiveness at a more sustainable dimension, thereby prospering the requirements at the

individual, societal, and global economic levels. The research paradigms under Industry 5.0,

evolving sustainable dimensions and real-time dynamic agility are nascent. This study

explores the present research paradigms, i.e., flexibility, reconfigurability, and digital SC
