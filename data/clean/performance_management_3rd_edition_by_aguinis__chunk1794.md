## Evolution of Legislation and Performance Management Practices in China

Given its increasing global importance and economic power, it is interesting to consider how recent legislation is affecting performance management and reward systems in firms in China. The Chinese government has recognized that performance management systems can contribute to firm productivity and to the competitiveness of China in the global arena. Thus, the Chinese government is accelerating economic reforms related to performance management such as giv- ing employers more rights to terminate employees. These changes have led to what can be con- sidered very innovative performance management practices in many Chinese companies. For ex- ample, software developers Ufida, Shanda, and Natease are adopting practices that are quite consistent with those used by U.S. firms. Ufida uses performance information to determine as much as 25% of annual salaries, and Shanda has a company-wide performance management system with clearly specified standards: Employees are evaluated twice a year, there is a 360-degree feedback system, and bonuses are awarded based on performance ratings.36
