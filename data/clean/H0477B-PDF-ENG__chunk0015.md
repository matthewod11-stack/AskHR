## Moreover, says Katie Bethell, Founder & Executive Director of lobbying

group Paid Leave for the United States (PL+US), the status quo has

become seen as a risk. “There’s starting to be brand risk for being

a company that doesn’t support family leave,” she says, “and there’s

gender discrimination risk if you’re only offering it to women and not

to men, or if you’re undermining women’s ability to succeed in your

company.” This isn’t just hypothetical. Several companies — including

CNN, JP Morgan Chase, and Estee Lauder have all been sued by men

making the case that giving them less leave on the basis of their sex

was illegal. Between 1998 and 2012, family-leave discrimination lawsuits

shot up 590%, according to estimates from the Center for WorkLife Law

— even though overall, discrimination lawsuits fell.

Despite the strong business case for offering paid leave, most companies

still need to be convinced. Bethell outlined four things that may have

been part of Walmart’s decision to offer paid leave:

Broad employee support. Showing that there’s broad support for

a new policy in your organization is important, says Bethell. In

Walmart’s case, she pointed to a petition for better policies that

garnered thousands of employee signatures. A Walmart shareholder

also introduced a resolution calling for better paid leave about a month

before the company announced the new policy.
