# superior predictive performance.

Despite random forest's superiority after tuning, it's noteworthy that even without

hyperparameter tuning, the random forest still outperformed the other methods, showcasing its

robustness and versatility in handling data with minimal parameter optimization.

The performance of logistic regression, while a commonly used method, fell short compared

to both random forest and decision tree models. This suggests that the linear relationship

assumptions of logistic regression might not capture the complexity and non-linearity present
