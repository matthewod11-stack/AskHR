# TRAINING MODELS 344

Clinical psychology may be deﬁned as “a scientiﬁc and pro- fessional ﬁeld that seeks to increase our understanding of human behavior and to promote the effective functioning of individuals” (Reisman, 1991, p. 3). Clinicians share with other psychologists a valuing of truth and a commitment to its determination, which they believe is best done through scientiﬁc methods. However, they are also committed to being of help to people, who often present urgent problems that require immediate assistance. They emphasize the value and uniqueness of each individual and so strive to provide services to all populations. Thus, they have faced, and no doubt will continue to face, the dilemma of addressing insis- tent and pressing human needs with measuring instruments and methods of treatment whose validities are questioned by others, as well as by clinicians themselves.

In this chapter, we are going to consider the history of clinical psychology through its various phases of develop- ment. We will view the ﬁeld in the context of the changing milieu of attitudes and professional approaches that have characterized the area known as mental health. Throughout the relatively short history of the ﬁeld, there have been dif- fering views as to the roles of science and “art,” as well as both favorable climates (which we have titled zeitgeists) and resistance within the ﬁeld. We shall also review the changing requisites for training and qualifying clinicians and treatment approaches and take a brief view of current and possible fu- ture developments.

Surprisingly, the history of clinical psychology is almost as long as the history of scientiﬁc psychology itself. Scien- tiﬁc psychology is often said to have begun when Wilhelm

Wundt founded the ﬁrst psychological laboratory at the Uni- versity of Leipzig in 1879; clinical psychology can be said to have originated when Lightner Witmer, who earned his doc- torate under Wundt established the ﬁrst psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania in 1896 (Routh, 1996; Routh & DeRubeis, 1998; Witmer, 1897). Since at that time psychology itself was still in an early stage of gaining aca- demic, scientiﬁc, and public acceptance, many psychologists had misgivings about the prudence of establishing an applied ﬁeld of their discipline. In fact, almost a century later many clinicians believe such misgivings continue to remain detectable.

The early clinical psychologists thought of themselves as researchers, psychometricians (or measurers), and reeduca- tors in the areas of individual differences, the ways in which people differ from one another, such as intelligence (see the chapter by Sternberg in this volume), personality (see the chapter by Sternberg, the chapter by Barenbaum & Winter, and the chapter by Weinstein & Way, all in this volume), and abnormal behaviors (see the chapter by B. Mayer & A. Mayer in this volume). Because the histories of those topics are ad- dressed in those and other related chapters within this volume (e.g., see the chapter by Mandler, the chapter by Morawski & Bayer, and the chapter by Marecek, Kimmel, Crawford, & Hare-Mustin) our task is made easier than it might have been. Yet it must also be pointed out and acknowledged that clini- cians draw, more or less, from almost every area of psy- chology, and thus every chapter is of some relevance to the history of clinical psychology. So, recognizing the arbitrari- ness of what we are about, let us begin.
