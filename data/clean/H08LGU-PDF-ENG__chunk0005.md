## HBR / Digital Article / What Comes After DEI

The predominant response to this backlash among practitioners I’ve

talked to has been to largely continue with the status quo, rebrand the

language as needed, and adhere to existing initiatives and programs

under the DEI umbrella that remain legal until forced to do otherwise.

Fewer practitioners — or employers — are considering whether DEI

work itself has room to improve.

In this moment, leaders and practitioners invested in building healthier

workplaces and societies for everyone have a once-in-a-generation

opportunity to reimagine this work — not only to adapt to a new

sociopolitical climate, but to let go of practices that have outlived their

usefulness and refocus our eﬀorts on what works.
