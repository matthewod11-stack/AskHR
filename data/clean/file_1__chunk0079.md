values (Verloo and Lombardo, 2007). According to the criticism, liberal feminist theory treats women as they were equal to men. However, according to Scott (1988), women cannot be identical to men. Thus, they cannot be equal.

As has been mentioned in the previous subsection, it is important to note that the conceptualization of gender equality has gone through a number of changes, from the idea of similarity to emphasizing the differences between genders. However, when equality and difference are paired dichotomously, they structure an unachievable choice since when one speaks about equality, he/she has to accept the notion that difference is opposing to it and vice versa (Scott, 1988). Different conceptualizations of gender equality illustrate that the question of differences between women and men, and whether they should be treated equally because they are fundamentally the same or equitably because they are fundamentally different, remains unsolved.

Despite the criticism of liberal feminist theory and conceptualization of inequality as a problem of achieving equality as sameness, this thesis builds on many ideas of this particular theory and this particular conceptualization. For instance, liberal feminist theory claims that in order to achieve gender equality both genders should be provided with equal opportunities which refer to treating individuals as equals. Based on the main assumption of the theory, I understand gender equality as treating men and women alike despite their different biology. I also see gender inequality as socially constructed differences between men and women in the society, which are filtered through traditional notions of masculinity and femininity, by which women continue to experience unequal treatment. In my opinion, in order to achieve gender equality, both genders should be provided with the same rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. I see the solution for overcoming gender inequality in the strategy of equal opportunities. As Lehto (1999) mentioned, in order to achieve gender equality, both men and women should be provided with equal opportunities, so they both are able to realize their ambitions.

2.2.3. Approaches to gender inequality

Apart from different conceptualization of gender inequality, there are several ways of analyzing it. Holli (2003) presented a useful typology of approaches to gender inequality. The first one, philosophy of gender equality, focuses on investigating the whole idea of gender equality and its concepts (Holli, 2003). It concentrates on such issues as meaning of gender equality, types of its conceptualization, its accomplishment, conditions for it, interdependence between gender equality and other societal concepts.

Another approach, gender equality policy studies, is interested in the ways gender equality can be promoted. This approach focuses on comparing political institutions, policy actors, gender equality policies and reforms, equal pay strategies, equality plans and other related issues across countries (Holli, 2003). This approach analyses the ways in which one could predict the ideal position of gender equality in political practice (Bacchi, 1999).

The next approach, the feminist-discursive analysis, is interested in the linguistic concept of gender equality. This deconstructive approach is a combination of feminist theory and
