# further analysis.

When we lay out the above sequence most team members immediately

grasp the paradox of constructive dissent — that it’s vital for unleashing

innovation and yet hard to establish as a prevailing norm.

As we help teams shape constructive dissent into a team norm, we

encourage them to signpost each of the steps as they move through

them. For example, when a team begins a formal session of constructive

dissent, a team member might say something like, “Let’s start with step

one, generation. What ideas do we have?” Once generation is complete,

the team member might announce, “Ok, if we’re done with generation,

let’s move into step two, clariﬁcation. What evidence do we have to

support these ideas?” After the members of the team have exhausted

all pertinent clarifying questions, a team member will signpost the

third step by saying, “I think we’re ready to move into friction. Let’s

challenge the ideas we’ve identiﬁed.” Finally, once all challenges and

contrary points of view have been considered, the team member can

say, “Great, let’s move to the last step of selection. Which of the ideas

we’ve discussed have real potential and should be considered for further

analysis and testing?”

We’ve been amazed at how distinguishing the steps and signposting as they move through them helps teams self-regulate more eﬀectively and
