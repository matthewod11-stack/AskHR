# Self-appraisal

Within a multi-source feedback model, the focal individual receives ratings from sources all around him/her and also partakes

in self-appraisal. Self-appraisal refers to the practice whereby the ratee rates his/her own performance. It is the self as a rating source that is of interest in this section of the monograph. Relatively little is written on self-appraisal as a rating process in comparison with peer or subordinate appraisal. However, a number of issues need to be taken into consideration when utilising this rating source within the 3608 feedback process.

Cardy and Dobbins (1994) argue that self-

appraisal is a natural development in performance appraisal which has stemmed from the recent growth and popularity of teams and high level participation in organisations. However, Baruch (1996) postulates that the most ``neglected'' rating source in the literature on multi-rater systems is the employee himself/herself. McMahon and Gunnigle (1994) suggest that self-appraisal is quite popular in organisations. They highlighted that more than 50 per cent of UK employers; 40 per cent of US organisations; and more than 50 per cent of Irish employers use some form of self- appraisal. Albright and Levy (1995) point out that individuals tend to assess their own performance irrespective of whether they are formally required to do so by the organisation. Thus, it makes sense that self- assessment should be formally recognised in the performance appraisal process.

There are a number of reasons why self-

appraisal may be used by organisations. Thornton (1980) enumerates the following: evaluation of current performance for . administrative purposes; identification of training and development needs; criterion measurement in applied research, e.g. test validation, evaluation of training; reporting past achievements at time of application for a new job;

.

.

.

. measurement of constructs in basic research, e.g. measurement of self- perceived performance and effort in studies of motivation.

It is the use of self-assessment/appraisal for evaluating performance and/or the identification of training needs that is of interest in this monograph.

Advantages and disadvantages of self-ratings Self-appraisal is advocated because of the potential advantages associated with its use. First, alternative raters, such as the self, are found to be more accurate in their ratings of certain performance dimensions than
