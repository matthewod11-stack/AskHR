## Namely, in line with gender role and emotional labor theory, women

leaders engaged in low levels of abusive supervision regardless of how

anxious they felt about the pandemic. By contrast, men leaders engaged

in more abusive supervision, including behaviors such as being rude,

ridiculing, yelling at, or lying to their reports when their anxiety was

higher. Women leaders also provided high levels of family-supportive

supervision irrespective of how hopeful they felt about the pandemic.

By contrast, men leaders provided family-supportive supervision only

when they felt more hopeful.

We also acknowledge some limitations of our study. Our sample was

relatively homogenous, including only leaders (and direct reports)

identifying as cisgender women or men, the majority of whom are

heterosexual, thus failing to represent other gender identities and

sexual orientations. Since our theories are based on research concerning

gender roles, it is crucial to extend this line of inquiry to leaders

with diverse gender identities and sexual orientations. Additionally,

our sample was predominantly white, and our study primarily reﬂects

those living and working in a developed economy (the Netherlands).

Research indicates that gender stereotypes and men’s and women’s

self-views may manifest diﬀerently across various cultural settings. For

instance, recent research found that Nigerian women rated themselves

as more agentic and communal compared to German women, whereas

Nigerian men rated themselves as more communal than German men

but similarly agentic. Consequently, our ﬁndings are limited to Western

gender roles. We encourage future research to explore whether these

eﬀects extend to non-Western contexts with racially and gender-diverse
