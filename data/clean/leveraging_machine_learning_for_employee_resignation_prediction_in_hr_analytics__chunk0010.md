xi and xj thus represent the features of i and j, respectively. (cid:2399)e weight matrix W converts the feature vectors; the a(cid:2386)ention vector a computes the relevance of the network between the nodes. N(i) stands for the collection of neighbors of node i; operation k denotes vector concatenation. When aggregating the data for node i, the a(cid:2386)ention coe(cid:2649)cient 𝛼ij measures the degree of focus one should pay to node j’ s features.
