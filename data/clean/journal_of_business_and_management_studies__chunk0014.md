# 4.3 Ada-Boost Algorithm

Hasan et al. (2024), indicate that the AdaBoost algorithm is a classifier that integrates weak classifier models to establish a solid classifier. Independently, a single model may result in poor classification performance. Nevertheless, by incorporating multiple classifiers and cautiously choosing the training set at every experiment, along with strategically designating weights during the last voting process, it becomes possible to attain a high-level accuracy score for the final classifier. This classifier employs the collaborative strength of multiple classifiers to elevate the effectiveness and accuracy of the classification process.
