## Cognitive, Affective, and Cultural Inï¬‚uences on Stigmatization

In view of the pervasiveness of stigmas and the problems faced by stigmatized individuals, social scientists have attempted to understand the stigmatization process. One seeming goal of their efforts has been to eliminate the invidious distinctions that divide people into groups, and thereby reduce the problems faced by marked individuals (Allport, 1954; Brewer & Miller, 1984; Heatherton, Kleck, Hebl, & Hull, 2003; Goffman, 1963; Jones et al., 1984; Miller & Brewer, 1984; Stockdale & Crosby, 2004; Tajfel, 1974).
