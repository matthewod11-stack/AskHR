esteemed publishers who vouch for the accuracy and dependability of the data as well as the selection criteria (Mangas-Vega et al., 2018). However, in contrast to other fields, the vast majority of the scientific literature in the field of Humanities is dispersed across numerous sources of information; consequently, it is fraught with peril to restrict the searching of data to a single source, as is the case with some other investigations (Sivarajah et al., 2017). The use of these four databases from prestigious publishers will both guarantee the high standards of the journal and significantly increase its potential readership. The systematic review process consists of three parts. Identification is the first stage. Screening follows, and the inclusion procedure is the last stage (refer to Figure 1).

Finding the keywords to be employed in the search strategy procedure is the first step. Based on prior research, similar phrases and terms relating to the effect of workplace culture on deviant workplace behavior were utilized. The keyword list was examined and improved, for instance, the insertion of various spelling variants. The final form of the keyword search list is presented in Table 1. The primary goal of this research is to identify empirical quantitative studies regarding the association between workplace culture and deviant workplace behavior. Several items were considered as a method for discovering criteria as presented in Table 2. In this study, we looked for articles published between 2012 and 2022 (within the recent previous eleven years)
