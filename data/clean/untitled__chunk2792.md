# Differing Views on Human Rights 513

for psychologists and ended by citing the United Nations (UN) Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Punish- ment.This was followed by an appeal condemning “any form of torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment as a method employed during detention, imprisonment, con- ﬁnement in psychiatric institutions, and under clinical cir- cumstances generally” and any psychologists who condoned or participated in such practices. Since the NIPresolution had been submitted after the deadline date, an assembly vote was required to place it on the IUPsyS agenda.

Shortly after the APA representatives arrived in Paris on July 17, it became apparent that the APA resolution was deemed antagonistic and inappropriate for a psychological (rather than psychiatric) congress. It posed a threat of divid- ing and politicizing the union. The NIP resolution was more comprehensive and ﬂexible, focused on the ethical responsi- bilities of psychologists; it also represented the efforts of a small member country while making observations similar to the APAresolution. Thus, the APArepresentatives communi- cated informally a willingness to withdraw the APA resolu- tion if the NIP resolution could be placed on the assembly agenda.

When the IUPsyS Assembly opened on July 19, the secretary-general mentioned the NIPrequest to add an item to the agenda and to place it before the APA agenda item. This provoked statements that resolutions with a political content should not be discussed at the IUPsyS Assembly, followed by a comment from the president that the IUPsyS was not concerned with politics but “with the correct exercise of our profession, which is psychology.” It was decided to post- pone a vote until July 22—thus providing more time for in- formal discussion and the preparation of a draft statement by the IUPsyS Executive Committee.

At the second assembly meeting on July 22, members voted to place the NIPresolution on the agenda. At that point, the APA representatives moved to withdraw the APA resolu- tion in favor of discussing the NIP resolution. The IUPsyS president then offered a substitute resolution, drafted by the Executive Committee, covering the same points as the APA and NIP resolutions. The IUPsyS Resolution on Human Rights, condemning any collaboration by psychologists in the abuse of professional practices, was adopted unani- mously by the IUPsyS Assembly. It was subsequently pub- lished in the American Psychologist and is reproduced in full in Rosenzweig et al. (2000). UN declarations particularly pertinent for psychology were previously summarized by Rosenzweig (1988).
