## Neither foundational nor best practices for delegated decisions

1 Respondents who said (a) that their organizations make high-quality decisions, (b) that their organizations make and execute decisions quickly, and (c) that their

organizations see higher growth rates and/or overall returns from their decisions.

2 Includes only respondents who answered about delegated decisions. For respondents at organizations following both foundational and best practices for delegated decisions, n = 20; for respondents at organizations following all foundational practices, n = 38; and for respondents at organizations following neither type of best practices, n = 74.

Decision making in the age of urgency

Looking ahead Getting to great decision making is not easy. But there are ample opportunities for organizations to increase their odds for success, including the practices that follow:

— Segment your decisions. Each decision type relies on fundamentally different success factors, so it’s imperative that companies and decision makers approach each one differently. For instance, empowerment is critical to making effective delegated decisions, while defined processes can slow down those types of decisions. The opposite is true for cross-cutting decisions, where well-designed processes and well-run decision meetings are the keys to effective decision making.

— Understand the root causes of decision-making pitfalls. Many factors can lower the quality and slow the speed of decision making. So identifying these factors through tools such as employee surveys or diagnostics—and then addressing them effectively—requires a nuanced approach. If a too-high number of stakeholders is the root cause of slow decision making, for example, there is a huge risk that organizations could overcorrect by excluding the inputs from too many key decision makers and, potentially, reduce those people’s commitment once the decision is made. Instead, the root cause of the problem to solve would be how—rather than

how many—stakeholders are involved in decision meetings.

— Go after quality and speed. Quality and speed are both critical outcomes for every decision type and are keys to our definition of decision- making success. Yet the relative significance of each one can vary depending on the situation. For any decision where the level of organiza- tional risk is low or can be easily mitigated, or where the decision can be undone once it has been made, velocity is more important than quality. With delegated decisions in particular, speed is extremely critical and enabled by deci- sion making at the right level of the organization. When the people closest to a decision are empowered to act autonomously as changes arise, the conditions are better for speedier (and more successful) decision making. However, quality is much more critical with big-bet and cross-cutting decisions. With these types of decisions, the risks involved are much more significant and require more care to manage, which is enabled by having the right people in the room, well-managed meetings, robust debate, and good coordination. One way to achieve both quality and speed, across decision types, is through agile organizational struc- tures: for example, small and autonomous teams that are empowered to make rapid, iterative decisions and have the best understanding of the decision at hand.11
