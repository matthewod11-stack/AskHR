# TWO ASSOCIATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

The essence of a profession is daily involvement with patients or clients. The context in which this interaction occurs, including the very important issue of reimbursement for services rendered, falls within the jurisdiction of public policy (e.g., the political process). For psychology to become an active participant within primary care (or to expand its scope of practice to include prescriptive authority) requires institutional collective knowledge of the evolving “bigger picture” and ongoing interrelationships existing within soci- ety and the generic health care arena. Historically, profes- sional psychology has, at most, seen itself as solely one of the mental health disciplines and has not concerned itself with broader public policy or public health issues (DeLeon, VandenBos, Sammons, & Frank, 1998). These two program- matic initiatives have signiﬁcantly changed that perspective.
