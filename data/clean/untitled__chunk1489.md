# The First Wave (c. 1876–1920)

Only a small cohort of American women held higher degrees in psychology in the early years of the twentieth century. Some women in this cohort questioned prevailing beliefs about innate sex differences in personality and ability. For instance, Helen Thompson Woolley conducted the ﬁrst labo- ratory study of sex differences in mental traits, developing innovative measures in the process. Woolley stressed the overall similarity of the sexes, critiqued biases in earlier re- search, and discussed possible environmental determinants of observed differences. Indeed, she argued that the experi- mental method was of little use for studying sex differences because it was not possible to ﬁnd male and female research subjects with equivalent social training and experiences. As we noted earlier, Woolley did not mince her words in assess- ing psychology’s claims about women and sex differences.
