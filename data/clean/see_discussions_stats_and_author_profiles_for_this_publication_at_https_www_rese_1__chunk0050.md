The above Table 1 indicates the factors of employee satisfaction that are related with the overall

employee satisfaction score. Correlation is high in case of Recognition and reward (r = 0.813, p

< 0.01), Immediate supervisor (r = 0.792, p < 0.01), Communication (r = 0.788, p < 0.01), Role

(r = 0.779, p < 0.01), Culture and ethics (r = 0.746, p < 0.01), Training programme (r = 0.725, p

< 0.01), Working condition (r = 0.688, p < 0.01), and Leadership and planning (r = 0.684, p <

0.01). The correlation was low for Team work (r = 0.580, p < 0.01) and Career (r = 0.496, p <

0.01).

The above factors were subjected to regression analysis to identify the most influencing factors

of employee satisfaction and the results are indicated in the table below.
