# 1.3 Paper structure

The paper starts presenting a focused literature review on coaching in organizations. Next, the theoretical framework and the hypothesis are presented, following by the methodology and analysis. Finally, the discussion section presents the key scientific and managerial implications of the research as well as the avenues of future research.

2.1 Definition and characteristics of coaching

Coaching has been defined as a process for improving work performance (Fournies, 1978); as a one-to-one process of helping others to improve, to grow and to get to a higher level of performance, by providing focused feedback, encouragement and raising awareness (Corcoran et al., 1995; Hargrove, 1995; Heslin et al., 2006; Orth et al.,1987; Richardson, 2009; Whitmore, 1985); and as a developmental process that enables and empowers people (Evered and Selman, 1989) and opens new opportunities for learning through which improved performance is attained (Ellinger and Bostrom, 1999; Ellinger et al., 2003).

Several studies differentiated coaching from other helping behaviors, like mentoring or counselling (D’Abate et al,

2003; Ellinger, 2003; Hagen, 2012). These studies consider mentoring as a guiding relationship led by a senior executive who provides advice, information and emotional support to a younger employee on a voluntary basis, while counselling is more concerned with the employee’s emotional state as it affects performance (D’Abate et al, 2003; Ellinger, 2003; Hagen, 2012).

In business settings, two main streams of research emerged. One of these streams concerns research on executive coaching. In executive coaching, a top-level executive (usually the CEO, but it could also be one of his/her direct reports) is being coached by an external consultant with the purpose of helping this individual achieve mutually identified goals, improve his/her professional performance and personal satisfaction, and consequently improve the effectiveness of the organization (Joo, 2005; Kilburg, 1996).

The other stream of research concerns managerial coaching, also identified as the manager-as-coach model, employee coaching or simply coaching as it is used in this article. In this case, any manager in the company can use coaching as a managerial tool to help his/her subordinates achieve a series of externally-set organizational goals and increase their job-related performance. Although coaching and executive coaching share some aspects in common and they both arise from similar roots (Hagen, 2012) research has seen them as two different constructs (D’Abate et al., 2003; Hagen, 2012; Pousa, 2012), and also different from other directive managerial behaviors like supervising, managing or providing feedback (Ellinger and Bostrom, 1999; Good, 1993; Ingram et al., 2005; McLean et al., 2005; Pousa, 2012; Rich, 1998; Richardson, 2009).

This paper is focused on the use of coaching by managers in order to help their subordinates achieve higher performance through facilitation and discovery. Building on Ives (2008), we define coaching as a non-directive, goal-focused and performance-driven intervention led by the manager.

2.2 Antecedents and consequences of coaching

Concerning the antecedents of coaching, scholars identified a number of skills that managers must have in order to conduct it (Gilley et al., 2010; Graham et al., 1993, 1994; Orth et al., 1987), the proper organizational climate for coaching (Ellinger et al., 2005; Everett and Selman, 1989), the organizational focus on long- or short-term results (Pousa and Mathieu, 2010) and the situations that trigger a coaching intervention (Ellinger, 2003).

Concerning the consequences of coaching, both practitioners and scholars have praised the positive consequences of coaching on job satisfaction, performance, commitment, and employee development. The rationale for this statement is that in a coaching context, people will feel more valued and respected by their employers, thus they will tend to be more loyal and work harder. Furthermore, more developed people will have higher job-related competencies, perform better and obtain higher customer satisfaction (Ellinger et al., 2005). Two recent qualitative studies provide initial support to these statements; both salespeople and sales managers agreed that coaching skills impact salesperson’s development, which ultimately increases salesperson’s job performance and customer relationships development (Deeter-Schmelz et al., 2002, 2008).

Recently, scientific interest in coaching increased. Some studies found that coaching might reduce salesperson manipulative and deviant behaviors like lying (Mathieu and Pousa, 2011) or sales-orientation (Pousa and Mathieu, 2014). Also, that coaching can increase salesperson relational behaviors, like customer-orientation (Pousa and Mathieu, 2014), commitment and motivation (Onyemah, 2009), job satisfaction (Agarwal et al., 2009; Ellinger et al., 2005; Onyemah, 2009) and performance (Agarwal et al., 2009; Pousa, 2012; Trépanier, 2010).
