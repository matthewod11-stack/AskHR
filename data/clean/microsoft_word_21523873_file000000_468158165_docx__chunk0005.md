relations and management, which makes her insights more broadly relevant. Polito (2013) reviews the

strategies for handling difficult conversations proposed by Stone et al., (2010), Leebov (2010), Fisher,

Ury, and Patton (1991) and Crawford (2008), and extrapolates a set of ‘tips’ on ‘how to conduct

successful communication during difficult conversations’ (2013, p.150(cid:47)1). She highlights for instance,

the need to: ‘deal in facts, not opinions’ (Zofi & Meltzer, 2007); to analyse the goal that the manager

culture); to practice before engaging in the actual conversation, thus calming emotions by role(cid:47)

playing; to give the interlocutor a chance to explain the issue from their perspective; to be clear about

desired behaviours and to follow up with further conversations. Borrowing from Polumbo et al.

(2010), Polito (2013, p. 151) concludes that ‘communication is more about building rapport, empathy

and cooperation through the art of inquiry, rather than talking to or at employees’ and that ‘successful

communication skills may … help to avert confrontation through employee commitment’.
