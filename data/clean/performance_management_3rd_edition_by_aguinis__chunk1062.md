# subordinate and the supervisor11:

- System inauguration • Self-appraisal • Classical performance review • Merit/salary review • Development plan • Objective setting

Recall that informal performance discussions take place throughout the year. In addition, however, there should be regularly scheduled formal meetings for the specific purpose of discussing the various aspects of performance and the performance management system. The fact that the supervisor allocates time to this activity sends a message that performance management is important.

The first meeting, system inauguration, includes a discussion of how the system works and the identification of the requirements and responsibilities resting primarily on the employee and on the supervisor. This discussion includes the role of self- appraisal and the dates when the employee and supervisor will meet formally to discuss performance issues. This meeting is particularly important for new employees, who should be introduced to the performance management system as soon as they become members of the organization.

The second meeting, the self-appraisal, involves the employee’s assessment of herself. This meeting is informational in nature and, at this point, the supervisor does not pass judgment on how the employee regards her own performance. This meeting provides an opportunity for the employee to describe how she sees her own perform- ance during the review period. It is helpful if the employee is given the same form to be filled out later by the supervisor so that she can provide self-ratings using the same dimensions that will be used by the supervisor.

The third meeting, the classical performance review meeting, during which employee performance is discussed, includes both the perspective of the supervisor and that of the employee. Most performance management systems include this type of meeting only. No other formal meetings to discuss performance are usually scheduled. This meeting is mainly past oriented and typically does not focus on what performance should look like in the future. The fourth meeting, the merit/salary review, discusses what, if any, compensation changes will result from the period’s performance. It is useful to separate the discussion of rewards from the discussion of performance so that the employee can focus on per- formance first and then on rewards. If these meetings are not separated, employees may not be very attentive during the discussion of performance and are likely to feel it is merely the price they must pay to move on to the part of the meeting that really matters: the discussion about rewards. Although these meetings are separate, supervisors should explain clearly the link between the employee’s performance, discussed in detail in a previous meeting, and the rewards given. Rewards are not likely to carry their true weight if they are not linked directly to performance.

The fifth meeting, the development plan, discusses the employee’s developmen- tal needs and what steps will be taken so that performance will be improved during the following period. This meeting also includes information about what types of resources will be provided to the employee to facilitate the development of any required new skills.
