# Prompt Engineering

Let’s try it (cid:450)rst with a test folder with only a few (cid:450)les in it, which will need to be renamed from

(cid:450)lename.txt to dra(cid:454)_(cid:450)lename.txt.

- 1. Copy the output from Table 16 (without the ```bash ``` text wrapper), and paste it in a new

(cid:450)le called: “rename_(cid:450)les.sh”.

- 2. Open a terminal window and type: . rename_(cid:450)les.sh. It will ask to enter a folder name, e.g.

test. and hit enter.

- 3. The script seems to run (cid:450)ne. You will see the message: Files renamed successfully.

When you look into the test folder, notice that all the (cid:450)les were pe(cid:455)ectly renamed to dra(cid:454)_(cid:450)lename.txt.

It worked!

Prompts for explaining code

As a developer when you work in teams you have to read someone else’s code. Gemini can

help you with this as well. Let’s take the code output from Table 16, remove the comments

and ask the large language model to explain what’s happening, See Table 17:
