# Initial Decisions

Prior to conducting classroom training, several decisions need to be made by an organization.

Who Will Conduct the Training? Training seminars can be conducted by a variety of sources including in-house trainers who are employees of the organization, outside trainers who contract with the organization, videotapes, and local universities. In-house trainers are used when a training program will be presented too frequently to justify the cost of an outside trainer or when the training topic is so specific to the organization that finding outside trainers would be difficult.

External trainers are used when the trainers in an organization lack the expertise on a particular topic or when the cost of internally developing a training program exceeds the cost of contracting with an external trainer. For example, an organization needing two days of training in communication skills would be bet- ter served contracting with an external trainer at $, a day than spending the $, it would take to develop the training program on its own. However, if the training program were to be offered twice a week for two years, the organiza- tion might be better served using in-house trainers.

Tens of thousands of training consultants around the country offer semi- nars to industry. Needs analysis, however, must be used to determine whether such seminars are actually necessary. Sam Miller, personnel director for Roanoke (Virginia) Electric Steel Company, has commented that he receives an average of two brochures each day advertising various seminars. Even though a seminar may sound interesting, it should be used only if it directly relates to some aspect of the job or to the people doing the job. For example, a seminar on communica- tion skills may sound interesting, but it probably would not improve an electron- ics assembler’s performance, whereas a seminar on electronics might. Likewise, a seminar on personal money management may not relate to the assembler’s job, but it may be useful if it solves outside problems that affect his job performance or attendance.

Rather than using actual trainers, many organizations use videotapes as part of their training programs. Videos have a clear economic advantage over live lecture when the training session is to be repeated many times.

A consultant-conducted seminar usually costs between $ and $ per hour plus expenses, whereas most videotapes can be purchased for $ to $. Thus a two-hour videotape will pay for itself if used only two or three times. Developing a seminar in-house takes about  hours of preparation ($) for each seminar hour (Zemke, ). Developing a custom video costs between $, and $, per finished minute (Sosnin, b). Thus the develop- ment of a custom two-hour training video would cost between $, and $,!

Many organizations are beginning to use local colleges and universities to handle their training needs. The advantages of using colleges and universities are lower costs, access to excellent training facilities, access to well-known faculty, and the potential for employees to receive college credit for com- pleting the training (Martyka, ). Local universities are typically used for technical (e.g., electronics, computer programming) and leadership training and are most appropriate when only a few employees need training at any given time and the cost of setting up a training lab is prohibitive. A good example of an organization using a variety of training options can be found at an AT&T manufacturing plant: Seminars on problem solving are conducted by the training staff, communication skills seminars are taught by an outside trainer, and classes on the principles of electronics are offered at a local com- munity college.

Where Will the Training Be Held? Training can be offered on-site or at an off-site location such as a hotel, univer- sity, or conference center. The obvious advantage of conducting training on-site is that it is less expensive. However, many organizations have neither the space nor the equipment needed for on-site training. Holding training off-site has the advantage of getting the employees away from the work site and allowing them to concentrate on their training. In some cases, off-site training locations in Las Vegas, Miami, or San Diego are chosen as an incentive to get employees to attend training or as a reward for performing well at work.

How Long Should the Training Be? Determining the length of a training session is an interesting dilemma. From a cost-efficiency perspective, it is better to conduct a weeklong training session rather than divide the training into  half-day sessions spread over a one-month period. However, from an interest perspective, few employees enjoy attending  hours of training in a week.

For the highest level of learning, training material should be presented in small, easily remembered chunks distributed over a period of time (distrib- uted learning) rather than learned all at once (massed learning). As shown in a meta-analysis by Donovan and Radosevich (), if too much training occurs at one time, employees will not be able to pay attention to all that is being taught or be able to remember that on which they did concentrate. Conse- quently, training performance will be lower when training is massed rather than distributed.

The best example of the principle of massed versus distributed practice is studying for exams. If we distribute the reading over several days, the material is relatively easy to learn. But if we wait until the night before the test to read three chapters—that is, mass the reading—we will not retain much at all.
