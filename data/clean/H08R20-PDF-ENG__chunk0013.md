## HBR / Digital Article / Great Leaders Make People Feel Noticed

to check in on an employee who’s struggling, or answer a few more

emails instead of connecting with a team member.

Noticing also requires attention, and the erosion of our ability to pay

attention is another barrier to seeing others. Research by psychologist

Gloria Mark shows that our average attention span for a single activity

has decreased from over two minutes in 2004 to just 47 seconds today.

The decrease is due to increased distractions and information overload.

One result of the strain on our attention is that interactions become

automatic. Our one-on-ones start the same. Performance evaluations

become robotic. The weekly team meeting becomes habitual. Walks

down the hall turn into a rush to a meeting room, avoiding eye contact

with those we’re passing by. This attentional autopilot can cause us to

miss signals: An employee starts sharing less, a colleague’s voice takes on a diﬀerent tone, or someone seems less energized than they used to

be.

The good news is we can get out of attentional autopilot through

“articulated intention”—being deliberate in setting goals for how we

want to show up in our interactions to ensure we’re making people feel

seen. This starts consciously deciding to slow down, make space, and

use our time to pay deeper attention.
