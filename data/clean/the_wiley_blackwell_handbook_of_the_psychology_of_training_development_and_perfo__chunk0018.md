# Training

Fuller & Unwin, 2011). Evans et al. (2006) identify different forms of work-related learning that facilitate competence development in its “maximal” sense. Such forms of learning involve learning in, through, and for the workplace, encompassing activities such as engaging with and mastering changing tasks, roles, and environments (learning in the workplace); accessing a range of learning opportunities through the workplace (learning through the workplace); and engaging in various opportunities for learning for the work- place, which are of particular significance for those who are seeking to re-enter the work- place after a period of absence caused by unemployment or family circumstances. Evans et al.’s view of competences (2006) broadly emphasizes individuals’ participation in social situations, also embodying the mental, emotional, and physical processes that are integral to the development and expansion of human capacities. Such an interpretation relates to the conceptualization proposed by Illeris of the concept of competence, which is to use it “as a point of departure for a more nuanced understanding of what learning efforts today are about – with a view of reaching theoretically based and practically tested proposals concerning how up-to-date competence development can be realised for different people in accordance with their possibilities and needs, both within and outside of institution- alised educational programmes” (Illeris, 2011, p. 42).
