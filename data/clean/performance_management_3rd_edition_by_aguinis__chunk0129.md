# 1.1 DEFINITION OF PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

Consider the following scenario:

Sally is a sales manager at a large pharmaceutical company. The fiscal year will end in one week. She is overwhelmed with end-of-the-year tasks, including reviewing the budget she is likely to be allocated for the following year, responding to customers’ phone calls, and supervising a group of 10 salespeople. It’s a very hectic time, probably the most hectic time of the year. She receives a phone call from the human resources (HR) department: “Sally, we have not received your performance reviews for your 10 employees; they are due by the end of the fiscal year.” Sally thinks, “Oh, those perform- ance reviews. . . .What a waste of my time!” From Sally’s point of view, there is no value in filling out those seemingly meaningless forms. She does not see her subordinates in action because they are in the field visiting customers most of the time. All that she knows about their performance is based on sales figures, which depend more on the products offered and geographic territory covered than the individual effort and motivation of each sales- person. And, nothing happens in terms of rewards, regardless of her ratings. These are lean times in her organization, and salary adjustments are based on seniority rather than on merit. She has less than three days to turn in her forms. What will she do? She decides to follow the path of least resistance: to please her employees and give everyone the maximum possible rating. In this way, Sally believes the employees will be happy with their ratings and she will not have to deal with complaints or follow-up meetings. Sally fills out the forms in less than 20 minutes and gets back to her “real job.”

There is something very wrong with this picture, which unfortunately happens all too frequently in many organizations. Although Sally’s HR department calls this process “performance management,” it is not.

Performance management is a continuous process of identifying, measuring, and devel- oping the performance of individuals and teams and aligning performance with the strategic goals of the organization. Let’s consider each of the definition’s two main components:

- 1. Continuous process. Performance management is ongoing. It involves a neverending process of setting goals and objectives, observing performance, and giving and receiving ongoing coaching and feedback.1
