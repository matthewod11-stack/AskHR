## order financing among overconfident CEOs (Malmendier et al. 2006). Similar evi-

dence has been found for a sample of French start-up firms (Landier and Thesmar

2004). This increasingly robust evidence on managerial overconfidence gives rise to

the question of how corporate governance should respond to CEO overconfidence.

A large literature in corporate finance analyzes how options and stock grants help

to align the interest of the CEO (or other corporate executive) with the interest

of shareholders (Murphy 1999). The possibility of executive overconfidence alters

basic conclusions about these incentive mechanisms. If we worry that a CEO just

may have too positive a view on the value he or she can generate, then options and

stocks are not helpful. Overconfident CEOs do not need incentives to maximize the

market value of the firm’s equity-——that is what they perceive to be doing already.

In fact, options and stocks may then push them to act as if they were risk-loving

and choose investment which are riskier (and lower net present value) than share-

holders would prefer. This concern is of particular relevance given that the CEO

overestimates the expected value of those gambles to begin with.

If CEOs are overconfident, then other incentive devices may work better than

stocks and options. One example is debt (see Hart 1995, Chapter 6). An overconfident

CEO in a cash-rich firm tends to undertake too many investment projects, including

acquisitions. If cash is tied up for debt repayments and the capacity for senior debt is

exhausted, the CEO would need to issue more risky debt or equity to finance projects.

Given that overconfident CEOs perceive their firms to be undervalued by the equity

market and, consequently, expected returns to their projects will be underestimated

by providers of risky debt, the preexisting debt will curtail the tendency to overinvest.

More generally, a mechanism that requires the CEO to get an outsider’s approval

on an investment project would counterbalance CEO overconfidence. That “out-

sider” could be a vigilant board. Companies typically specify in their charter that
