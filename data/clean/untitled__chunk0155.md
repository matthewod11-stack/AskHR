# The Rise of Laboratories in America

William James saw in the early results of experiments in psy- chophysics and sensory physiology the beginning of science in the measurement of phenomena that the mental philoso- phers could only describe. Like James, G. Stanley Hall (1844–1924) was impressed by the impetus given to the new psychology by the results from experiments on sensory phys- iology. Hall, while preparing for the ministry, studied theol- ogy and philosophy in Germany and found that science was relevant to these pursuits, especially scientiﬁc empiricism. Hall founded the ﬁrst American laboratory in the new sci- ence of psychology at the Johns Hopkins University in 1883. While Hall’s laboratory at Johns Hopkins usually is acknowl- edged as the ﬁrst psychological laboratory in the United States, the designation was not without other claimants. Debate over credit for the establishment of laboratories pro- vides some measure of the importance, real and symbolic, that psychologists attached to the laboratory and to the exper- imental research that it was designed to foster (Capshew, 1992).

By 1893, 20 psychological laboratories were operating in theUnitedStates,nearlytwiceasmanyasinEurope(Nichols, 1893, as cited by Capshew, 1992). By 1904, there were 49 laboratories of psychology in colleges and universities in the United States (Benjamin, 2000; Camﬁeld, 1973). Psychology had become an accepted part of the curriculum, required for the undergraduate degree in 8 universities and represented in 62 institutions by three or more courses (Miner, 1904). Psy- chologists argued their case for the new science (and for their own professional careers) to the general public and to trustees and governing boards of academic institutions with some suc- cess (Leary, 1987). Not only were courses in psychology and laboratories begun, but journals were established, beginning with Hall’s American Journal of Psychology in 1887, to make public the results of laboratory investigations as well as to

provide an outlet for the theoretical and philosophical articles that were part of the young science. The American Psycho- logical Association (1892) provided annual meetings for the reports of investigations and for psychologists to consider ways to advance the profession. Graduate programs in uni- versities produced over one hundred PhDs between 1892 and 1904; between 1898 and 1903, psychology ranked fourth after chemistry, zoology, and physics in the number of PhDs awarded (Camﬁeld, 1973).

The laboratories founded in American colleges and universities served to initiate students into laboratory prac- tices, familiarize them with standard pieces of laboratory apparatus, and introduce them to the subject matter and opportunities for research in scientiﬁc psychology. The ex- periments of the early laboratory reﬂected the scientiﬁc beginnings of the ﬁeld: Studies of psychophysics, sensory capacities and sensitivity, memory, attention, and voluntary movement (reaction time) were emphasized in manuals writ- ten for the laboratory course (e.g., Judd, 1907; Langfeld & Allport, 1916; Sanford, 1897; Seashore, 1909; Titchener, 1901–1905). The topics represented by these laboratory experiments were also those that continued to be a part of the research agenda of psychologists. Increasingly, however, the interests of psychologists extended beyond Wundt’s line of demarcation between topics that could properly be pursued through laboratory experiments and those that could not. Much of the development of psychology consisted of expanding the range of psychological processes that were amenable to scientiﬁc investigation within and outside the laboratory while continuing to debate the deﬁnition of the ﬁeld and the methods most useful to its development.
