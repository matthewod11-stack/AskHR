# value in most corporate environments.

Andrew K., for example, is a senior leader who measured himself

almost exclusively based on his company’s bottom line. He felt safe

and comfortable in the objective world of numbers. Awakening the

intelligence of his heart began with his willingness to explore the fears

and discomfort that arose when he turned his attention to what he was

feeling, and how he aﬀected others.

Over time, Andrew discovered that he had been holding his desire for

more human connection at a distance, believing that it would make him

more vulnerable, and get in the way of his external goals. As he allowed

himself to have more personal relationships with colleagues, he also

found that collaboration with them became easier, and that conﬂicts got

resolved more rapidly.
