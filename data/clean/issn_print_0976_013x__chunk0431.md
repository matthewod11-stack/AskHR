Within our social contexts, conformity is pervasive. Occasionally, we are aware of our

behaviour, but we often act unconsciously without much thought or awareness. Sometimes,

we approve of things with which we disagree or behave in ways we are aware we cannot

control. Conformity facilitates the organization's behaviour as a single entity working together

as a team. Businesses must have regulations and guidelines that streamline and govern

output standards to retain brand integrity. It may be claimed that conformity stifles

innovation, but it also eliminates this issue by clarifying organizational norms and employee

expectations. It enables companies to have a degree of uniformity, which increases the

likelihood that everyone is working towards the same objective. Here it is pertinent to

mention about a major research on the theme â€“Solomon Asch, a noted psychologist,

recruited participants to execute what they thought was a simple perceptual test in these

1950s experiments. Pupils had to pick a line that matched one of three lengths. Individuals

choose the right decision. When questioned by confederates who had been informed of the

study and purposely chose the wrong line, 75% of participants conformed at least once. This

experiment effectively exhibits normative influence.
