- 2. Literature Review

The Perceived organization support theory (POS) is an underlying framework to identify and establish the direct association of managerial coaching with employee job performance as well as indirect influence via thriving at work (Eisenberger et al., 1990). The employees need support from their organization to cope with a challenging work environment and psychological satisfaction (Abid et al., 2015). The employees within organizations consider the actions and behaviors of their supervisors and leaders as representative of the organization Kottke and Sharafinski (1988). The employees show favorable attitudes and behavior toward the organization in exchange for perceived well-being and positive actions from their employer (Levinson, 1965).

The behaviors exhibited by supervisors and leaders in the coaching environment of the organization are considered by their subordinates as their well-being and organizational support. The supervisors communicate the expectations to the subordinates regarding their role in the organization, provide timely feedback to enhance their performance, recognition of their contrition toward the organization, fair compensation, learning and development opportunities for job, and play the role of learning facilitator (Kim, 2014). When employees perceive favor from the organization in the form of coaching behaviors of their supervisors (Sonenshein et al., 2013), in exchange employees respond to these favourable actions in the shape of improved job outcomes like thriving at work, extra role performance and in role performance as well (Colquitt et al., 2007; Kim & Kuo, 2015). POS improve employee attitude and behaviors in the workplace. A recent research study on managerial coaching analyzed the influence of managerial coaching on employee outcomes such as organizational citizenship behavior toward individual, organizational citizenship behavior toward organization, and in role employee performance through mediating effect of trustworthiness of manager perceived by the employee (Kim & Kuo, 2015), provided POS as a basis for considerate the functioning of managerial coaching in organization to improve various employee outcomes. This research focuses on developing the association between MC and job performance as well as the intervening role of thriving at work which is the contribution of this research.

Based on the discussions above, this research focuses on the first question which is about managerial coaching about employee job performance. Therefore, next section pertains to this unique relation which is also the novelty of this research.
