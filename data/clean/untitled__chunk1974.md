# A NURTURING ZEITGEIST

World War II represents a watershed in the history of clinical psychology. In its aftermath, clinical psychology received something it had not received before: enormous institutional support from the federal government, from universities, and from the APA for the training of clinical psychologists. In 1942, Robert Yerkes chaired a committee of the National Re- search Council, which sought to unite the AAAPand the APA by drafting a new constitution that would be acceptable to both groups. Such a constitution was drafted and provided for an APAdedicated “to advance psychology as a science and as a means of promoting human welfare.” Henceforth, the APA would be involved in professional and scientiﬁc issues, and a new journal, American Psychologist, would give coverage to both concerns. In 1944, the APA accepted the new constitu- tion, the AAAP transferred its membership of about 600 psy- chologists to the APA, and the dues went up. American Psychologist began publication in 1946. The new APA had a divisional structure, in which psychologists with similar in- terests could afﬁliate. Division 12 was the division (now known as the Society) of Clinical Psychology, and it for a time became APA’s largest division.

Even before America’s entry into the war, oppressive dic- tatorships in Europe had brought about an inﬂux of psycholo- gists to the United States who did much to invigorate and enrich American psychology.
