# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

DEB LIU:

Yeah, I think there’s a lot of technology that’s helping. One is also

communities are helping each other. People say, “Hey, there’s a photo

of my great-grandfather. Where do you think he is?” And you see

communities come together and help people. And so I do think that

technology is making it easier. Also, if there’s a damaged photo, being

able to restore it easily through AI is so much more powerful because

restoration used to be so incredibly expensive.

ADI IGNATIUS:

You’ve been in this role for a couple years. Tell me what you think is the

secret to leadership, or what does good leadership look like in 2022?

DEB LIU:

I think the biggest thing is people’s lives are so diﬀerent than they

were even just three or four years ago. We have a ﬂexible work policy, and it allows people to live their lives as well as come into the oﬃce

if they choose. And that’s changed so much. If I had told you that you

were going to write an article in 2022 about people working from home

primarily in 2019, I think you would have been really surprised. And

so life has changed so much, and we’ve reorganized our lives in the

last three years. That is the biggest challenge, but it’s also the biggest

opportunity. This gives us a chance to rethink how we structure our lives

and our work and it gives us the opportunity to really look to the future

and shape work how we want it to be.
