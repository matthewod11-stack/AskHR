and microinvalidation. Microassaults are deﬁned as explicit racial derogations that can be verbal (e.g., racial jokes), nonverbal (e.g., discriminatory be- havior), or environmental (e.g., offensive posters). These are attacks meant to hurt the recipient. It is generally intentional and conscious. The two other forms of microaggression described (microinsults and microinvalidations), however, tend to operate unconsciously and are unintended. A microinsult is an act or comment by the leader that conveys rudeness, insensitivity, or degrades a person’s racial identity or heritage (e.g., saying to a black employee that another person was chosen for promotion due to a better “culture ﬁt”). Microinvalidations are actions that exclude or nullify the views, experiences, or reality of a person of color (e.g., when an Asian American is asked what country they come from).

Microaggressions can be focused on various social identities, though most of the research has focused on race (Nair, Good, & Murrell, 2019). Even if the microaggression is not intended to do harm, the recipient may indeed interpret the treatment as disrespectful and implying that they are of lower status and less importance than members of nonmarginalized social identity groups. Evidence is building that microaggressions are associated with both mental and physical harm to the recipient (Williams, 2020).

Ostracism. Workplace ostracism is deﬁned as “when an individual or group omits to take actions that engage another organizational member when it is socially appropriate to do so” (Robinson, et al., 2013, p. 206). Examples of ostracism include employees receiving unanswered greetings from the leader, not being included on email threads, being treated as if they are not present, having ideas ignored, getting passed over for an opportunity, having the leader refuse to talk to them, or if the leader exits the area when they enter (Ferris, Brown, Berry, & Lian, 2008). Wesselmann and Williams (2017) provided additional examples of ostracism such as not being given eye contact (B¨ockler, H¨omke, & Sebanz, 2014; Wesselmann, Cardoso, Slater, & Williams, 2012; Wirth, Sacco, Hugenberg, & Williams, 2010), being forgotten (King & Geise, 2011), or experiencing uncomfortable silences (Koudenburg, Postmes, & Gordijn, 2011).

While ostracism is an effective social inﬂuence tool, it often leads to harmful consequences for individuals who are the recipients (Ferris et al., 2008; Robinson et al., 2013). In a meta-analysis by Howard, Cogswell, and Smith (2020), they concluded that ostracism was negatively related to core performance, helping, and voice, positively related to turnover and turnover intentions, and negatively related to well-being, satisfaction, and justice perceptions.

In light of the harmful effects of rejection, microaggressions, and ostra- cism, it is difﬁcult to understand why leaders would engage in these types of
