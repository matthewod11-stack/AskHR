## Instructor-Led Learning, Blended Learning, and the Role of the Instructor

Despitetheincreased interestinanduseoftechnology-basedinstructionalmethods, instructor-led training remains the mostfrequently used method ofinstruction (Miller 2013). Although much of the previous discussion focuses on a movement toward informal and self-directed learning, the formaltrainingcontext,bothinpureandblendedforms,remainsarelevantfieldofstudy.Blended forms of learning were created to extract the best of both worlds: the face-to-face social context of classroom learning and the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of online learning (Bonk & Graham 2012). However, blended forms of learning may still be susceptible to negative factors associated with both types of learning, including disengagement due to self-regulation, failure in the online portion of learning, or a lack of interest in lecture or other passive forms of learning.
