# substantial bonus upon project success.

Hiring managers should be aware of ﬁrm-speciﬁc context and try to

minimize it, while making sure any solution you procure from outsiders

can be integrated. For example, Netﬂix was able to get more than 2,000

submissions in their famous prediction challenge by providing an easy-

to-understand database of movie ratings that didn’t force participants to

understand the underlying architecture of Netﬂix’s backend systems.

You also can run some experiments and horserace diﬀerent models.

Try to measure the results of comparable tasks or projects done in diﬀerent ways (internally and through open talent). This will allow you to measure productivity under diﬀerent conditions. We believe

the idiosyncratic nature of most production means an experiment

is more valuable than broad advice. Experiments may also include trying diﬀerent formats — contests or hourly contracts — and diﬀerent platforms with diﬀerent mixes of contractors.
