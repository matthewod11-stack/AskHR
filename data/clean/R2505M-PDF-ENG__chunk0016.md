## employees. Typically, the extent of damage from breakthrough thinking

is highest when it is applied to “wicked problems”—those that are

constantly changing and hard to deﬁne and whose solutions involve diﬃcult trade-oﬀs. The more complex the ecosystem around the

problem, the more likely it is that the solution will impose economic

and social costs. So while breakthrough thinking is ideal if the problem

is clearly bounded—like getting a rocket into space—it won’t work well

when it comes to, say, ﬁxing the U.S. healthcare and education systems.
