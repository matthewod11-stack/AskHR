# Type of task

To understand this relationship, we must first realize that not all noise is the same. Two sounds with the same level of loudness can have different frequencies. For example, the sound of a tugboat whistle is much lower in frequency than a train whistle. Lower frequencies do not affect employee performance as much as higher frequencies.

Furthermore, sounds that have the same frequency, intensity, and loud- ness can differ in their pleasantness. For example, noise levels at rock concerts and nightclubs are certainly loud, yet some of us enjoy the sound enough to pay money to hear it. We would probably not pay money to hear a jet engine produc- ing the same sound levels as a rock concert.

This effect can be seen with an employee who listens to music through head- phones at work. The noise level of the music is often greater than that of the machines in the environment, but it is considered to be more pleasant. Keep in mind, however, that even though the music may be more interesting than the machine noise, the noise level has the same potential effects: Hearing loss can occur just as easily from music as it can from factory noise.

Noises also differ in whether they are continuous or intermittent. Constant noise has less effect on employee behavior, so environments with steady noise levels are not as disrupting as those in which either noise frequency or noise intensity changes.

Another factor that affects the relationship between noise and employee behavior is the type and difficulty of the task. Noise affects difficult tasks or those that involve cognitive and perceptual skills more than it affects less difficult tasks or those that involve physical performance (Cohen & Weinstein, ).

Individual differences in people also determine the degree to which noise will affect performance. Weinstein () examined individual differences in noise sensitivity in college students and found that noise-sensitive students had lower academic performance, were less comfortable in the presence of others, and became more disturbed than their less noise-sensitive peers. Melamed, Harari, and Green () found that Type A personalities’ blood pressure and heart rate increased under conditions of high noise but not under conditions of low noise.

The effect of noise also depends on the necessity for and familiarity of the noise. When certain noises cannot be avoided—for example, the sound of a machine in a manufacturing plant—they are less irritating than unnecessary noises such as an employee talking too loudly or a roommate playing a stereo at full volume (Kjellberg, Landstrom, Tesarz, & Soderberg, ).

Likewise, familiar noise is less irritating than unfamiliar noise, probably for two reasons. First, a familiar noise is less distracting or meaningful than the one that we hear for the first time. For example, the regular passing of a train out- side an office produces less distracting noise than a suddenly dropped glass. Even though the train is louder, it is expected and familiar and thus not as distracting. Soldiers with war experience have often reported they were able to sleep through artillery explosions but would awaken instantly at the sounds of snapped twigs or close footsteps.

Familiar sounds may also be less distracting because our hearing loses sensi- tivity to loud sounds. For example, on first entering a factory, the noise levels are often very high and distracting. After a few minutes, however, the noise is less noticeable because we have become temporarily less sensitive to it.

Finally, noise affects certain types of employee behaviors in different ways. Noise is more likely to decrease the quality of performance rather than its quan- tity (Broadbent & Little, ), to cause people to walk faster and make less eye contact (Korte & Grant, ), to decrease job satisfaction (Sundstrom, Town, Rice, Osborn, & Brill, ), and to decrease performance on cognitive tasks (Cohen & Weinstein, ; Smith & Jones, ). But perhaps the greatest effects of noise are not on performance but on employee health and morale.

As Figure . shows, research indicates that in addition to hearing loss, continued exposure to high levels of noise (measured in decibels [db]) can raise blood pressure of employees in complex jobs (Melamed, Fried, & Froom, ), increase worker illness (Cohen, ), cause people to be less helpful (Fisher, Bell, & Baum, ), and produce more aggression and irritability (Quigley, Leonard, & Collins, ). Interestingly, even low levels of office noise have been found to increase employee stress and reduce task motivation (Evans & Johnson, ).

Noise also causes people to narrow their focus of attention so that they concentrate only on the most important stimuli. In one experiment, Korte and Grant () placed unusual objects (e.g., a brightly colored balloon tied to a lamp-post) and people (a woman wearing a large pink hat) along the sidewalk of a busy shopping district. Korte and Grant then asked shoppers if they had seen anything unusual and read them a list of the unusual people and things they could have seen. When traffic noise was high, only % of the shoppers noticed the items, compared with more than % when the noise was low. Although such narrowing of attention may decrease the performance levels of employees for whom it is important to notice many stimuli (e.g., police officers or safety inspectors), it may help the performance of employees who need focus on only a few different stimuli (Broadbent, ).

Noise Reduction. Given that noise affects employee morale, health, and perhaps per- formance, employers have attempted to solve or minimize the problem of noise by several methods. One has been by setting legal time limits on the exposure to noise at different decibel levels. As you can see from Table ., the legal lim- its set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are not as stringent as those recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

A second method is to change the environment by using carpeting and

acoustically treated ceilings (Sundstrom et al., ).

A third method has been by reducing the amount of unwanted noise that reaches an employee. Examples have included employees wearing protective
