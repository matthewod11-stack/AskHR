however, is not a simple task, and in most cases, it overlaps with state laws and practices (Blanck, 2022). A few states have gone further or further-reaching in the protection of disability than mandated by the ADA, and several have minimal enforcement machinery or remain highly dependent on federal frameworks. Therefore, depending on state-specific conditions, the effect of the ADA on workplace rights can vary greatly. 1.3 Research Objectives and Questions The main aim of this journal is to examine the variation existing between the implementation and actualization of ADA employment protections in all 50 states of America. Through the examination of the comparison of the state-level practices, as well as policies, and case outcomes, the research is aimed at finding out where the gaps lie in ADA implementation and the reasons behind those gaps by determining how these gaps impact disabled members of the workforce. Specifically, this study aims to:

- (cid:32) Provide an evaluation of the functionality of ADA enforcement mechanisms at the federal and state levels.

- (cid:32) Contrast varies between the consistency of employer accommodation and the accommodation of disabled employees in various states.

- (cid:32) Explore how conditions like political climate, funding, advocacy, and legal infrastructure create an uneven playing field in enforcement.

- (cid:32) The study will look into the lived experience of people with disabilities going through employment rights in the states of high compliance and low compliance. 1.4 Methodological Approach The mixed-method type of study is used in this research, as it is designed to correlate quantitative processing of the data on ADA and qualitative information about its case studies and stakeholders. The research study methodology is organized according to three main elements (Fordey, 2023):
