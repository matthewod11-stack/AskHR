# Dress

Organizational dress is also amenable to conceptualization through such a distributive lens. Differential accoutrement traditionally highlighted organizational status differences; the very terms ‘‘white’’ versus ‘‘blue collar’’ belie their origin in dress distinctions. High-involvement organizations eschew these demarcations of status (Lawler 1986; Lawler and Worley 2006), such as through adoption of common uniforms, by otherwise discouraging dress-related trappings of status, or through adoption of casual dress codes (Morand 1995; Pratt and Rafaeli 2001). Here again, the reasons for organizations’ adoption of such codes are complex, yet the trappings of status can be conceptualized as a resource or outcome, the organizational distribution of which (the ‘‘right’’ to dress as one chooses; not having status-marked dress) here shifts in the direction of equalization.
