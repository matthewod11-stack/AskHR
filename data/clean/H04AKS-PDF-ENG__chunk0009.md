# Kenneth Andersson for HBR

It seems like every business is struggling with the concept of

transformation. Large incumbents are trying to keep pace with digital

upstarts., and even digital native companies born as disruptors know

that they need to transform. Take Uber: at only eight years old, it’s

already upended the business model of taxis. Now it’s trying to move

from a software platform to a robotics lab to build self-driving cars.
