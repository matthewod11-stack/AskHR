## billion annually, nearly 10 times more than absenteeism. Yet many

senior leaders underestimate the problem. Employees who work while

sick experience reduced focus, slower decision-making, and increased

errors, ultimately reducing individual productivity by one third or

accelerates the spread of illness and drives up absenteeism costs, which

exceed $225 billion annually.
