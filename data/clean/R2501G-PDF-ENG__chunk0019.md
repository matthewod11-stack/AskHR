increasing the size of product teams so as to run more experiments

and more easily prioritize which ideas to test; hiring additional data

scientists to analyze the increased number of tests and reduce the time

needed to execute on them; and instigating more knowledge-sharing

meetings for the dissemination of results. In our experience, however,

those tactics are unsuccessful. Managers struggle to identify which tests

will lead to a meaningful impact; hiring more data scientists provides

only a marginal increase in experimentation capacity; and knowledge-

sharing meetings don’t create institutional knowledge. These tactics

may appear sensible, but they end up limiting the adoption of

experimentation because the processes they establish don’t scale up.
