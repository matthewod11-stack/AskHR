# Prepare for your preview

Here’s how to set up your own weekly preview:

Commit to 20 minutes before the start of each week. Make a

commitment to do this with the other core decision maker(s) for your

child, if any (your partner or co-parent, for example). To make sure

you stay consistent, link this to something that you do each week, and

ideally make it something fun. Perhaps you and your partner do it after

the kids are in bed and have your weekly Netﬂix date after. Or you do it

before your Sunday workout. The key is consistency. If it’s easier, begin

by committing to just four weeks and see how it goes.

Choose your documentation approach. Here’s the template we use

with Milo families, but a simple email, a shared Apple Note, or a text

overview can work just as well. Whatever you choose, it should be in a

format that can be easily updated with inevitable mid-week changes.
