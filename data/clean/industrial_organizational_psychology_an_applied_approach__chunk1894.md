questions. This provides important feedback to the presenter. Based on the audience reaction, the presenter can change the way he/she is doing something so that it better meets the needs of the audience. If you have a question, raise your hand and ask. Never feel shy about asking questions, because trainers like to get them, and if you are having trouble following something, you can be sure oth- ers are as well.

Be courteous to other audience members and allow them to ask their questions, too. Don’t do all the talking! If you disagree with something the presenter is saying, politely ask the presenter for a further explanation. If you still disagree, talk to the pre- senter after the workshop. Listen to other audience members without judg- ing their comments. You can respond to them, but shooting down others’ ideas and thoughts is not in good form. At the end of the workshop, introduce yourself to the presenter. If you enjoyed the workshop, say so. If the presenter asks you to evaluate the workshop when it is over, do so. This is the only way the pre- senter will know what to change or do differently. If there is room for comments, briefly explain why you liked or disliked something. The more specific you are, the more helpful the evaluation. Throw away your coffee cups, soda cans, or any other trash that you may have accumulated during the workshop.

through audience activity, and involving the audience by allowing them to share their opinions, stories, and expertise. Don’t force humor. If you are a naturally funny person, it will show. When using humor, make sure it meets an objective such as demonstrating a point or keeping the audience awake during a dull topic. Otherwise, humor for the sake of humor can be distracting. Humor should never be at the expense of others—the only safe target is yourself (in moderation). When answering audience questions, repeat the question if the room is large. If you are unsure of the question, ask the audience member to repeat the question or try to paraphrase the question (e.g., “Is what you

are asking . . .”). After answering the question, ask whether you have answered it sufficiently. If you don’t know the answer to a question, don’t bluff. You can ask if anyone in the audience knows the answer— nine out of ten times they do.

As with college lectures, many activities can take place within a seminar, including lecture, the use of audiovisual aids such as slides and videotapes, dis- cussion, and question-and-answer periods. Again, the choice of activities depends on the task or skill to be taught. If the skill is complicated, such as operating a machine or dealing with an angry customer, lecture alone will not be enough. The seminar should also include some type of practice or role play. If the infor- mation is not complicated but involves such visual material as building locations, flowcharts, or diagrams, visual aids should be added to the lecture. If the mate- rial covered is not comprehensive or if the feelings of the employees toward the material are important, then discussion should be included. Discussion not only helps further learning but also allows employees to feel that their opinions are important.
