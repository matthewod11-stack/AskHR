If you find yourself stuck at the “blank page problem,” we have tools on the Anthropic Console to help generate strong starting prompts or even improve prompts you already have or want to carry over from other models.

We find that teams tend to give up on prompting quicker than they should and immediately pivot instead to other perceived solutions such as fine-tuning. However, just a few hours of prompt engineering can very often fix their issue without going down the costly path of fine-tuning a bespoke model that incurs extra costs to train and maintain.

We recommend that you invest in prompt engineering as a key skill, as prompting can often improve a model’s capabilities by a large margin, and more quickly and adaptably than other options such as fine-tuning.

Anthropic has extensive resources available to support you with prompt engineering. Recommended resources include:

- Our prompt engineering documentation (tip: you can chat with Claude directly in the Anthropic docs search bar to either learn about prompting or have Claude unblock you on the specific issues you’re encountering)

- Our courses on core prompting techniques and production-

level prompting
