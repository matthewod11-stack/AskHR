- The Model of Hackman & Wageman (2005) deals with team coaching. It indicates how leaders can influence team learning and development by carrying out distinct functions in each work stage. For example, at the initial stages, the function of motivation, to get the members of the team to know each other better; later, strategy consultation for carrying out tasks; and in the final stages, education, with the objective of stimulating the group to think.

- The Model of Zaccaro, Heinen & Shuffler (2009) establishes the foundation of team leadership on connectivity, integration, and coherence among the team members. The leader’s fundamental role, aside from general management and leadership, is achieved specifically through coaching and developing the skills and capacities of the team members.

- The Model of Kozlowski, Watola, Jensen, Kim & Botero (2009), or adaptive, flexible, and fluid model, adapts to the contingencies of the work load, the abilities of the team members, and the relationships between them. The leader’s role can rotate among the team members depending on the circumstances, thereby creating distributed leadership.

- The Model of Morgeson, Scott & Karam (2010) proposes two dimensions: internal and external leadership and formal shared leadership. In addition, they identify two stages of team development. First, the transition phase where the team defines its mission, establishes goals, plans, organizes, works on the development of the team, and provides feedback. Second, the action phase where the task of the leader is to supervise, manage limits, create challenges, encourage self-management, and promote an atmosphere of social support. Today’s situations, so characterized by ambiguity and complexity, make it difficult for a leader to successfully carry out all the functions inherent to leadership. For this reason, the leader needs to exercise shared leadership, which can be defined as a dynamic and interactive process among the team members whose objective is to actively communicate with each other in order to attain the team’s goals or the organization’s goals or both (Pearce & Conger, 2003).

It has been noted that the effectiveness of shared leadership increases with the complexity of the team work, for example with decision-making. Shared leadership also improves group processes such as collaboration, cooperation, and coordination (Yeatls & Hyten, 1998). In regard to the effectiveness of the work team, it has been shown that there is a positive relation between shared leadership and the efficiency of the task in certain contexts, such as senior management, non-profit organizations, etc. (Carson, Tesluk & Marrone, 2007). We understand and share with Celma (2004) the fact that the new role of the sports manager should be based on an evolution that goes beyond strictly technical aspects to achieve an executive or leadership level. In this vein, the author establishes the differences in managerial styles between traditional leadership and newer forms of leadership (as demonstrated graphically in Table 2).
