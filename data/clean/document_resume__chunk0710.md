# Performance Appraisal

Many of the suggestions presented in previous sections of this chapter are focused on providing this necessary standardization. For example, the proper appraisal instru- ment must be chosen so that all raters are using the same dev ice. Rater selection, training, and involvement are intended to ensure that all raters share a common view- point and understanding of the appraisal process. The techniques described in the previous two sections are designed to make certain that there is standardization in the observation and recording of key instances of actual behavior.

However, there are other factors in the appraisal setting which also must be consid- ered. For example, William Sauser, Carlos Arauz, and Randall Chambers found that the level of background noise present when ratings were produced could have a signifi- cant effect on those ratings." Other contextual factors w filch have been found to influ- ence ratings include the presence of higher-level supervisors in the room where ratings are produced, the number of ratees evaluated in one session, the presence of environ- mental stressors, and the time available for making the ratings.59

Administrators who are serious about reducing the possibility of error in perfor- mance appraisals should consider standardizing such contextual factors as the time and place in which ratings are done, the number of ratees to be appraised at one time, and the presence of supervisors, trainers, and other persons when ratings are being produced. It should be obvious that a rater who is trying to evaluate 35 subordinates in an hour while working in a hot, crowded, noisy room late at night will quite likely pro- duce different scores than when evaluating five subordinates in an entire morning while working in quiet, comfortable surroundings.

To maintain fairness for all ratees, the administrator should ascertain that all ratings are produced under the same standardized environmental conditions. This may require, for instance, that a specified time and place be established at which all raters will per- form their work.

- 9. Motivate the raters to do a good job.

No matter how sophisticated a performance appraisal sy stem has been established,

no matter how well the raters have been trained, no matter how many observations of behavior have been recorded, no matter how carefully the context has been standard- ized, there still remains an essential factor which heavily influences the validity of the ratings obtained. "individual raters and their motivation or hick of motivation) to rate accurately. "60

Richard Klimoski makes the following obsery anon concerning this crucial factor.

I also feel that prime responsibility for doing this lies with upper management, and especially with the chief executive officer.6I
