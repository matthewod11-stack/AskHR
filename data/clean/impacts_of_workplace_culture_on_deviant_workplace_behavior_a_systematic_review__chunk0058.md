# Bujang et al.

Organizational culture had a significant effect on workplace deviance (di Stefano et al., 2019) although individual sociodemographic factors such as age and gender, in addition to characteristics of personality, are stronger predictors of both individual and organizational deviance (Nacˇ inovi’ et al., 2020). Both studies using the same framework developed by Cameron and Quinn (1999) appears to be consistent with Aleksi’c et al.’s (2019) work stating that deviant behavior can be linked to market and hierarchy cultures same as workplace culture that emphasis on ‘‘efficiency,’’ which can raise the level of deviant behavior. Conversely, clan and adhocracy cultures are the only types of culture that considerably reduce relational conflict and boost trust, which are linked to sabotage or customer-oriented beha- vior, a type of organizational deviance (Zoghbi- Manrique-de-Lara & Ting-Ding, 2016).
