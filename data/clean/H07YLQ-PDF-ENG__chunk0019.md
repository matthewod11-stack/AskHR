# ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial goals.

At the end of the day, your time is better spent on high-level

responsibilities, not routine projects. You are not a salesperson. You are

not the marketing manager. You are not the human resources director,

the payroll administrator, or the IT person. Nor should you be. With

the right recruiting and training, your employees will be the experts

at these tasks. Let go of your ego and start working on strategies and

systems. Get everything that could help someone else grow in their role

oﬀ your plate and onto that other person’s. Alternatively, you could hire

an expert or outsource a workﬂow. This will allow your value to go up

and give everyone around you the chance to systematically progress
