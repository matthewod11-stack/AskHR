## HBR / Digital Article / 5 Things Employers Get Wrong About Caregivers at Work

a new child, when they instead should be much broader to include other

kinds of caregiving needs beyond those of brand new parents.

A 2019 Harvard Business School report on caregiving found that while

welcoming a child was a top caregiving reason people left their jobs,

next on the list was caring for a sick child (49%) or managing a child’s

daily needs (43%). A third of people who left their position due to

caregiving cited eldercare as the reason, and almost 25% cited an ill

or disabled family member. The lack of supportive policies around a

range of caregiving life events can be costly for companies. According

to The Council on Aging, “70% of caregivers [who do eldercare] suﬀer work-related diﬃculties due to their dual roles…annually, employees

lose up to $3 trillion in wages and beneﬁts while employers lose $17-33

billion due to absenteeism and turnover.”

Creating paid family leave policies that can be used for a broad set of

reasons, including supporting family members’ physical and mental

health needs, and encouraging people to use the beneﬁt can help

improve loyalty, reduce burnout, and save on costly turnover.

Myth #3: Those who choose flexible work are less interested in advancement.

New data shows that women, people of color, and caregivers are more

likely to want to choose forms of ﬂexible and remote work. According

to Lean In’s 2022 State of Women in The Workplace report, “Only 1

in 10 women want to work mostly on-site, and many women point to

remote and hybrid work options as one of their top reasons for joining

or staying with an organization. Women of color and women with

disabilities are about 1.5 times as likely to experience demeaning and

‘othering’ microaggressions when they work mostly on-site as opposed

to mostly remotely.”
