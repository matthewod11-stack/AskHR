## their thoughts in an appropriate and persuasive manner. Managers

shouldn’t let their own eﬀorts in soliciting input be a reason to negate

the eﬀort employees demonstrate when they speak up.

that all input is valued and recognized — regardless of whether it was

solicited or oﬀered without prompting.
