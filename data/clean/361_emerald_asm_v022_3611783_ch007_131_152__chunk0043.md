culture. Similarly, Sue and Sue (2016) referred to this as first the introspective phase, in which individuals begin to look inward and question these issues, followed by the integrative awareness phase. In this stage, individuals begin to develop a nonracist White identity and begin to understand the role they can play in these issues.

The final stage of White identity proposed by these two models is the culmina- tion of all the thought and introspection the individual has put in thus far; the final stage is to develop a fully formed White identity. Helms (1995) referred to this as the autonomy phase, and Sue and Sue (2016) referred to this as the commitment to antiracist action phase. In this stage, the ally is not only comfortable as a White person and does not feel guilty for his or her race, but also actively behaves and models how an ally should act for others to see. Overall, both models suggested that a person must go through all of these stages (in some form) to become a White ally in the truest sense (and not simply in name only).
