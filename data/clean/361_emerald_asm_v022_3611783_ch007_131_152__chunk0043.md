In this chapter, we argue that allyship is a valuable tool that organizations should consider including in their overall diversity and inclusion strategy. Although often thought of as something individual people do, organizations can also be involved with this by helping to develop and promote allyship programs as well as to create an overall culture of allyship. Indeed, organizations should help to manage these initiatives in order to make them as effective as possible; many have argued that diversity can be very beneficial for organizations, but it needs to be well managed in order for it to yield positive outcomes (Galinsky et al., 2015; Jayne & Dipboye, 2004). Allyship can be less expensive and more personally meaningful for indivi- duals involved than other diversity and inclusion strategies, so it should be investi- gated by human resources (HR) professionals. From a practical standpoint, Sabat et al. (2013) also pointed out that allies in the workplace can help relieve the burden of diversity management from always having to fall on leadership and HR professionals.
