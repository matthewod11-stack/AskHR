# Table I. Demographic profiles

mediator in between the association of organizational justice and ER, and conflict management and ER. This study asserts that even if an employee perceives fair treatment and satisfaction with the management of conflicts, it would not directly transform into ER unless such feeling of being treated fairly and managing conflicts amicably leads to trust. This research tries to bridge the gap by testing the underlying action mechanism between the relationships. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:

H6. Climate of trust will mediate the relationship between organizational justice and ER.

H7. Climate of trust will mediate the relationship between conflict management and ER.

- 3. Methods 3.1 Sample A descriptive research design was used to identify the specific variables that may describe the existing ER scenario. Primary data for this study were collected from Odisha Power Transmission Corporation Ltd (OPTCL), located in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha. This state-owned public sector utility was previously named as Orissa State Electricity Board (OSEB). A large number of employees from OSEB were migrated to other public and private sector, as the ER scenario was highly detrimental. Individuals were bereaved of the facilities they required to maintain a healthy organizational life. Based on these hindrances, OPTCL was incorporated in the year 2004 under the Companies Act, 1956 and indoctrinated to harmonize the relationship between employers and employees by prioritizing the needs of the social entities. Thus, the study is intended to pursue an investigation in this sector to grab an insight into ER. A structured questionnaire was administered among the respondents to accumulate desired information. Out of 445 questionnaires administered, 331 valid responses were received with the response rate of 74.38 percent. Table I describes the demographic profiles of the respondents. The respondents included 231 (69.8 percent) males and 100 (30.2 percent) females. Most of the respondents were aged between 46 and 55 years (37.2 percent) followed by 56–60 years (25.4 percent), 36–45 years
