In another experiment, we told participants that they would be working

with a partner on a cooperative task, and we gave them the choice

between a partner who disagreed with them about gun reform and one

who declined to share their opinion. We found that people preferred

to work with someone who openly disagreed with them than with

because the potential partners who refused to share their opinions were

perceived as less trustworthy.

It’s also important to note that this phenomenon isn’t limited to

controlled lab settings: Similar eﬀects are evident in countless real-

world environments. Taylor Swift, for example, was met with some

suspicion when she tried to stay neutral on political issues, eventually

causing her to shift to a more forthright communication style. Disney

CEO Bob Chapek also ran into trouble after brieﬂy attempting to remain

neutral over Florida’s controversial “Don’t Say Gay” bill (angering

liberals who opposed the eﬀort) before half-heartedly committing to

Within organizations, managers and employees who refuse to

participate in the political discussions of the day — even if their reasons

Whether you’re talking with a handful of colleagues in a Zoom meeting

or releasing a public statement to millions of fans, trust is key — and
