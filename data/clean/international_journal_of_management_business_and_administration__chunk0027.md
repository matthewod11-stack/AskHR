Despite the benefits of goal setting, there are a few limitations of the goal-setting process (Locke & Latham, 2002). First, combining goals with monetary rewards motivates many organization members to establish easy rather than difficult goals. In some cases, organization members have negotiated goals with their supervisor that they have already completed. Second, goal setting focuses organization members on a narrow subset of measurable performance indicators while ignoring aspects of job performance that are difficult to measure. The adage “What gets measured is what gets done” applies here. Third, setting performance goals is effective in established jobs, but it may not be effective when organization members are learning a new, complex job.
