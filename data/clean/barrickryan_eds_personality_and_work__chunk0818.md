# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 291

Barrick and Mount’s meta-analysis (1991) of the criterion- related validities of the Big Five personality variables for predict- ing performance criteria provided the next critically important set of ﬁndings that focused I/O attention on the relevance of per- sonality variables for predicting performance at work. Indeed, this meta-analysis became the most cited Personnel Psychology article in the 1990s (Hollenbeck, 1998). The Project A ﬁndings, the Barrick and Mount meta-analysis, and earlier research by such eminent personality psychologists as Paul Costa, Lew Goldberg, Harrison Gough, Robert Hogan, Douglas Jackson, Robert McCrae, and Auke Tellegen provided a solid foundation for the renaissance of personality variables in I/O in the 1990s.
