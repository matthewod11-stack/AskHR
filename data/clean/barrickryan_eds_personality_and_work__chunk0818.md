# 290 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Meta-analyses that grouped personality measures into constructs, such as the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality, allowed previ- ously obscured relationships between personality constructs and criteria to emerge. Personality variables were related to criteria of interest. They accounted for signiﬁcant variance above and beyond cognitive variables and experience; personality variables were shown to have main effects. A renaissance occurred in the research and use of personality variables in the workplace.

Project A, the major research project in our ﬁeld during the 1980s, provided incontrovertible evidence of the importance of per- sonality variables for understanding and predicting behavior at work (see Campbell & Knapp, 2001, for a description of the proj- ect and many of its ﬁndings). Project A had a number of seminal ﬁndings:

- When validity coefﬁcients from previous validity studies are summarized according to personality constructs and criterion constructs, meaningful relationships emerge (Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp, & McCloy, 1990).

- Different personality constructs predict different work perfor- mance criteria (Hough et al., 1990).

- Socially desirable responding can be detected; more impor- tant, it affects criterion-related validity minimally, if at all (Hough et al., 1990).

- Cognitive ability tests predict some performance criteria bet- ter than personality scales (for example, “can do” criteria), whereas personality scales predict other criteria better than cognitive ability tests (“will do” criteria; McHenry, Hough, Toquam, Hanson, & Ashworth, 1990).

- Accuracy of prediction increases when personality variables are combined with cognitive ability measures (McHenry et al., 1990).

- When personality variables are added to models of the deter- minants of supervisory ratings of performance, variance ex- plained increases signiﬁcantly (Borman, White, Pulakos, & Oppler, 1991).

These ﬁndings fueled interest in personality variables during the 1990s.
