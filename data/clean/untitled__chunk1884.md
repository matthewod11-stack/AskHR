was not only irrelevant to the question but antithetical to the analytic method. Experimental research in psychopathology revived from the 1950s onward, extending in various direc- tions, both behavioral and biopsychological. Progress of ex- perimental work in psychopathology mirrored ongoing changes within general psychology and the neural sciences. Experimental work itself was greatly facilitated by the devel- opment of desktop computers, which replaced earlier bulky equipment. Computer portability made it possible to bring the laboratory to the patient rather than vice versa, thereby extending the kinds of sample that could be obtained.

By the ﬁnal decade of the twentieth century, experimental investigations of psychotic patients focused mainly on the as- sociation between brain structure and function, on one hand, and cognitive and emotional processes on the other. As an il- lustration of the changing emphases, we might note that by 1991 biological research on schizophrenia—a previously “functional” psychosis comprised four of the ﬁve volumes of the Handbook of Schizophrenia (Nasrallah, 1991). It was now regarded as an obviously biological disorder.
