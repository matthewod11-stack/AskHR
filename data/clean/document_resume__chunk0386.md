# Performance Standards

Performance standards require a list of conditions that will exist when a job is being performed well. Many organizations have implied performance standards, but these are not spelled out in accordance with job duties. In a formal system using performance standards, a job analy sis is conducted that results in a job description setting forth what is to be done. Performance standards descnbe how much is expected or how well the duties arc to be performed. Figure 3.8 provides an example of perfor- mance standards for an instructional position, in the dimension of "Instruction".
