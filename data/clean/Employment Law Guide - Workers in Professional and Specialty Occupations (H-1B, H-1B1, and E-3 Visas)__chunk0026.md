# for approval to employ a speciﬁc alien worker under H-1B status. For H-1B1 and E-3 visas, after the Department of Labor certiﬁes

the LCA, the employer must follow the procedures of USCIS and the Department of State, which diﬀer in some respects from procedures for H-1B visas.

The Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division is responsible for enforcement of this program.

H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 workers are granted a number of rights. The employer must give the worker a copy of the LCA. The employer must pay the worker at least the same wage rate as paid to other employees with similar experience and qualiﬁcations

or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of employment, whichever is higher. The employer must pay for non-

productive time caused by the employer or by the worker's lack of a license or permit. The employer must oﬀer the worker fringe

beneﬁts on the same basis as its other employees. Also, the employer may not require the worker to pay a penalty for leaving

employment prior to any agreed date. However, this restriction does not preclude the employer from seeking bona ﬁde "liquidated damages" pursuant to relevant state law. Liquidated damages are generally estimates stated in a contract of the anticipated

damages to the employer caused by the worker's breach of contract

. U.S. workers and job applicants may also have certain rights under the H-1B programs. U.S. workers employed by an H-1B

dependent or willful violator employer may not be laid oﬀ within 90 days before or after the employer ﬁles a USCIS petition to

employ a nonexempt H-1B worker in an essentially equivalent job. In addition, an H-1B dependent employer or willful violator must oﬀer the job to any U.S. worker who applies and is equally or better qualiﬁed for the job than the nonexempt H-1B alien

worker. The U.S. Department of Justice has the authority to investigate complaints of failure to hire qualiﬁed U.S. workers.

No employer of H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 workers may intimidate, threaten, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discriminate

against any employee, former employee, or job applicant for disclosing violations of H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 provisions or for

cooperating in an oﬃcial investigation of the employer's compliance.

U.S. workers and H-1B/H-1B1/E-3 workers may also examine the public disclosure documents that the employer is required to
