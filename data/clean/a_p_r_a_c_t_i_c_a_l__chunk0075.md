The manager pattern empowers a central LLM—the “manager”—to orchestrate a network of specialized agents seamlessly through tool calls. Instead of losing context or control, the manager intelligently delegates tasks to the right agent at the right time, e(cid:12)ortlessly synthesizing the results into a cohesive interaction. This ensures a smooth, uni(cid:10)ed user experience, with specialized capabilities always available on-demand(cid:15)

This pattern is ideal for work(cid:11)ows where you only want one agent to control work(cid:11)ow execution and have access to the user.
