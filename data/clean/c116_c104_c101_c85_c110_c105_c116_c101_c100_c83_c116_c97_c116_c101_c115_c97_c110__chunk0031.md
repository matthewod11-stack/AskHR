## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 255

awarded to the successful litigant are about 60 percent of her actual legal expenses (Thomas 1991). In the United States, the costs of successfully defending a wrongful termination lawsuit are usually lost to the company involved. Thus, when a PCO Canada employee is terminated and wants to file a lawsuit, in addition to paying her lawyer some money up front, she must at least consider the fact that she may later have to pay all her costs plus PCO's legal costs. This is a big barrier to mobilization for PCO Canada employees that is not faced by similarly situated PCO U.S. employees.

Both the contingency fee system and the ``loser pays'' method of allocating trial costs make it easier for the U.S. employee to pursue a legal claim than her Canadian counterpart.
