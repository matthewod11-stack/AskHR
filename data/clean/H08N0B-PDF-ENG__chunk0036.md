## indicators—such as employee engagement, retention, and team

productivity—before and after manager training. Use these insights

to ﬁne-tune programs and provide ongoing manager coaching.

Too many ﬁrms treat remote and hybrid work as a temporary

adjustment or an afterthought, leading to inconsistent policies and

missed opportunities. It’s no surprise some are yet again backtracking

and adopting return-to-oﬃce mandates. But instead of jumping on or oﬀ the latest remote and hybrid work bandwagon, your company can

take a strategic, data-driven approach to embed remote and hybrid

work into your business. As demands to adapt to the rapidly-evolving

future of work intensify, the organizations that succeed won’t be the

ones haphazardly reacting to trends but those that thoughtfully act to

make hybrid and remote work as a core part of their strategy.
