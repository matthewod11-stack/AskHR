for and interest in using more freelance options. Respondents who had worked with or hired independent staﬀ in the last year said that,

without the external help, they would have done the work themselves

service company; 3% would have hired a staﬃng ﬁrm. Just 8% said

they would have made new full-time hires, and 6% said the work simply

wouldn’t have been done.

remote freelancers compared to their pre-pandemic baseline, vs. just

6% who hired fewer freelancers) and planned to make more use of it
