# Original Research

In order to test the mediation effect between WLBC and turnover intentions, the Hayes test of mediation was applied. The results are shown in Table 4. The size of the indirect effect of WLBC on turnover intentions through job satisfaction is weaker than its direct effect, and insufficient evidence is found to support the mediation hypothesis. The null hypothesis is therefore not rejected.

The implication of this result is that WLBC is a direct influence on turnover intentions that does not have to act through the job satisfaction channel to increase turnover intentions. The lack of a mediating role for job satisfaction in the relationship between WLBC and turnover intentions is consistent with other work by Özbağ and Ceyhun (2014) who found no mediating effects of job satisfaction on the relationship between family-to-work conflict and turnover intentions in the Turkish context, in a study on marine pilots. This finding contrasts with findings of a partial mediating effect on job satisfaction on the relationship between work-life balance and turnover intention in Malaysian Higher Education institutions (Noor 2011), and a fully mediated relationship in the context of industrial employees in Iran (Fayyazi & Aslani 2015) and healthcare workers in New Zealand (Riley 2006). Is this sample in some way atypical of others, in that the studying process lend some robustness of individuals to WLBC, at least to the pressures related to withdrawal cognitions? To test whether the effect of education within this sample would weaken the relationship between WLBC and turnover intentions, further within-sample testing was performed, and this is reported as follows.
