# THE HAPPY WORKER 39

The greater sociability of happy people may have drawbacks as well. In occupations that do not require social contact, the desire for social rewards may be a distraction. Too much “water-cooler talk” or other unnecessary social contact may result in lower pro- ductivity. In fact, Furnham and Miller (1997) found that although extraverted sales employees were more likely than introverted em- ployees to be rated as high performers, young extraverts (who are likely to be dispositionally happy) were also absent most frequently. Furnham and Miller opined that this may be due to boredom and the fact that extraverts wanted to take days off to do activities that they found more exciting. At the team level, Barry and Stewart (1997) found that the percentage of extraverts within a team af- fected that team’s performance. Although having some extraverts on a team was beneﬁcial for performance (they argued that a mix of half extraverts and half introverts was ideal), too many extraverts was detrimental (perhaps because too many extraverts resulted in team members jockeying for control).

We must caution that the greater interpersonal attractiveness of happy people may lead to the perception that they are more productive when productivity is measured using supervisor ratings, a perception that may have real implications for the happy indi- vidual. For example, Burger and Caldwell (2000) found that job applicants high in positive affect were more likely to obtain follow- up interviews when seeking a job than were applicants who were low in positive affect. However, this perception may also be incor- rect. Therefore, researchers who are interested in actual produc- tivity must make sure to operationalize productivity in such a way that it cannot be inﬂuenced by likeability.
