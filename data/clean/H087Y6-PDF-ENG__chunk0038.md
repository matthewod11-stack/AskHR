## — non-solicitation agreements, no-hire, and no-business agreements

are subject to the general prohibition of unfair methods of competition

under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits

“unfair or deceptive acts of practices in or aﬀecting commerce,”

regardless of whether the ﬁnal rule becomes the law of the land.

Companies should therefore continue to protect their intellectual

property through exercising reasonable measures to protect their

secrets and informing their employees about the need to keep certain

sensitive information conﬁdential. Companies can continue to use the

patent system to protect innovation. They may also continue to use

non-disclosure agreements as long as those do not attempt to overclaim

what is conﬁdential.
