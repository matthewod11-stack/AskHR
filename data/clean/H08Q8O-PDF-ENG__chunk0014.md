unspoken but unconscious and not clearly articulated in people’s minds

until the moment they are broken.

This makes return-to-oﬃce friction a useful focal point. We see four elements in this issue: 1) diﬀerences in individual preferences about the percentage of work people do in the oﬃce; 2) diﬀerences in preferences

about the percentage of work their colleagues do in the oﬃce (few

people are enthusiastic about commuting into a mostly empty oﬃce building to have virtual meetings all day); 3) diﬀerences of belief about

whether people being in the oﬃce is actually good for the company; and 4) diﬀerent assumptions about the right of the employer to set

aside individual preferences for the good of the company. The pandemic further highlighted these diﬀerences as it showed many people that

working from home could even make them more productive—so why

should they be forced to go back to the oﬃce?

Studies show that the diﬀerences don’t line up neatly by demographics:

Stereotyping young people or women as remote workers, for example,

and older men as preferring an oﬃce hides huge amounts of variation. The diﬀerences are so big that no single policy will please everyone.

Further, the psychological contract is predicated on an increasingly

shaky assumption that people can agree about what is in the general

good. The issue, in other words, is with the whole idea that ﬁnding a

best-ﬁt policy is the answer. In our research, we have seen companies

both succeed and fail with ﬁve-days-in-the-oﬃce policies, two-days-in-

the-oﬃce policies, and fully remote work. Success doesn’t depend on
