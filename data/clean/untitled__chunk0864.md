# Coexistence

Other investigators argued for coexistence. Charles Spearman, for example, had both a differential theory of intelligence (Spearman, 1927) and a cognitively based one (Spearman, 1923) (both of which were described earlier). Cronbach (1957) argued for the merger of the Ô¨Åelds of differential and experimental psychology.
