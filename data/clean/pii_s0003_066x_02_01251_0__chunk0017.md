ness? As Klimoski and Jones (1995) noted, selecting the right mix of individuals to comprise a team implies at- tention to worker requirements on at least three dimen- sions: ability, values and personality, and politics (a team member’s future role in making things happen once a decision is reached).

Will the role of tests of cognitive abilities focus on identifying candidates with general (as opposed to specific) abilities, such as basic verbal and numeracy skills, the ability to think critically, to reason logically, and to draw conclusions from a body of facts? If so, this would com- port with recent findings that general cognitive ability is an efficient predictor in terms of job performance (Ree & Earles, 1992; Ree, Earles, & Teachout, 1994) and training performance (Ree & Earles, 1991).

How can psychology contribute to the optimal use of people with lower levels of cognitive abilities? Because not all jobs require high levels of cognitive ability (e.g., many types of service jobs), what other types of predictors of work performance will validly forecast success in such jobs? Services, which now account for 74% of the gross domestic product, and 79% of all employment in the United States, are expected to account for all of the net growth in jobs in the next decade. Will measures of per- sonality characteristics—for example, adaptability, em- pathy, and ability to work under stress—receive relatively more attention than cognitive ability tests in jobs whose primary objective is customer service? To be sure, the ability to select, train, and retain front-line, customer- contact workers will be a top priority for many organi- zations. Companies such as Marriott and Disney now require the same skills of workers that they once de- manded of managers—-“‘people who are resilient and re- sourceful, empathetic and enterprising, competent and creative” (Henkoff, 1994, p. 110).

There is no question that well-developed measures of personality characteristics can account for additional variance in the prediction of behavior on the job (Hogan, 1991; Ones, Mount, Barrick, & Hunter, 1994; Tett, Jack- son, Rothstein, & Reddon, 1994), Although a wide variety of such measures exists, they have not been used routinely to select employees. However, given the emphasis on ef- fective interpersonal interaction in the new forms of work organization, more and more managers insist that such characteristics be taken into account. This poses another question of interest to industrial and organizational psy- chologists, namely the following:
