## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

ADI IGNATIUS:

Let’s shift gears to talk about authenticity, another topic that you have

researched and written a lot about. Most conversations that I have about

leadership at some point evolve into a conversation about the need for

total authenticity at work. My sense is you have a more complicated take

on all this. How should leaders think about the authenticity question?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

This total authenticity stuﬀ drives me nuts. What is total authenticity?

Is it to say whatever crosses your mind? Is it to dress how you might

dress at home on a Sunday to go take a walk in the park? What does that

mean? I think there’s a lot of ﬂuﬀ in all of this. What’s the deﬁnition of

authenticity? Is it a trait? Is it an outcome, a process of learning about

yourself and trying to be as much yourself as possible?

I don’t think it’s a trait. I think it is a process of learning. We want to be

authentic. Nobody likes a fake. Nobody follows a fake. It’s bad for your

mental health. I’m all for it.

The question I ask is how can you deﬁne authenticity in a way that

doesn’t condemn you to being as you always have been? We grow, we

evolve. We’re multiple. We have diﬀerent facets, diﬀerent aspects of who

we are that play out. And we need to be able to express that complexity

and also ask, “What does it mean to be authentic when I’m learning?”

It’s great when it’s habitual behavior. You know how to do that. But

when you’re learning, you haven’t ﬁgured it out yet. People tend to

confuse habitual behavior with authenticity. The minute they’re out of

the comfort zone, “Oh, that’s not really me. I’m not so authentic.” The

comment usually is, “That’s not me.” Well, it’s not you now and you
