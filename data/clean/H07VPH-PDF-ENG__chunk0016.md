- 3. Consider your career stage.

Are you starting your career, at your peak, or counting the days until

retirement? We expect a new employee to listen and learn and an

experienced one to lead the team, but that’s not always the case.

Sometimes if you’re new at the job, you may feel pressure to prove

yourself. And a senior employee may feel comfortable stepping back

and letting more junior staﬀ take charge. Thinking about your career

stage can help you understand your decision-making behavior.
