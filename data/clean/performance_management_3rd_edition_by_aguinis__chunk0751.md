## Chapter 5 • Measuring Results and Behaviors

biases and errors made by those rating performance better than do those in absolute systems. Such errors include leniency (i.e., giving high scores to most employees), severity (i.e., giving low scores to most employees), and central tendency (i.e., not giving any above-expectations or below-expectations ratings).

On the other hand, there are also disadvantages associated with the use of com- parative systems, which may explain why only about 4% of all published research on performance appraisal has used them as opposed to the use of absolute systems (described in Section 5.2.2).18 First, employees usually are compared only in terms of a single overall category. Employees are not compared based on individual behaviors or even individual competencies, but instead are compared based on an overall assess- ment of performance. As a consequence, the resulting rankings are not sufficiently specific so that employees can receive useful feedback, and also these rankings may be subject to legal challenge. Second, because the resulting data are based on rankings and not on actual scores, there is no information about the relative distance between employees. All we know is that employee A received a higher score than employee B, but we do not know if this difference is, for example, similar to the difference between employee B and employee C. Some of these disadvantages were experienced recently by Microsoft and were noticed by Lisa E. Brummel, the senior vice president in charge of human resources.19 She noted that, by using a forced distribution system, “people were beginning to feel like their placement in one of the buckets was a larger part of the evaluation than the work the person actually did.” Similarly, a posting in June 2005 on an anonymous Microsoft employee’s blog called MiniMicrosoft read as follows: “I LOVE this company, but I hate the Curve.”

Finally, there are specific issues that should be considered in the implementation of a forced distribution method. This method assumes that performance scores are normally distributed, with some employees performing very highly, some poorly, and the majority
