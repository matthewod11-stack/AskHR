## —JANET SANCHEZ, AFRICAN AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST

The history of ethnic minority psychological publishing has been arduous. Navigating between the mainstream ocean and the waters of color, scholarship of color has struggled with dominant psychological paradigms. Mainstream mod- els’ cultural insensitivity and irrelevance to people of color aggravate the challenge. Since ethnic minorities are often exposed to intellectual imperialism and domination at the expense of their cultural values (Said, 1994), internalization of dominant psychology frequently interferes with the pro- motion of a culturally competent psychology. As a result of professional socialization, many psychologists of color suffer from cultural Stockholm syndrome, taken hostage by the dominant cultural values—including the stereotypes of their own group—and in turn, accepting, internalizing, and believ- ing them (DiNicola, 1997).

stream journals requires conformity with the dominant para- digm. Dualism, however, risks segregation because it tends to place indigenous psychological paradigms in separate ethnic journals,rarelyreadbymainstreampsychologists.Withinplu- ralism, on the other hand, psychologists of color offer diverse interpretations to reality, aiming at the co-existence of ethnic minorityperspectives with dominant psychology.

As the written word is the DNA of culture, ethnic minor- ity psychology propagates itself by publishing. However, a history of marginalization of psychologists of color within the publication process has hindered such process. Contem- porary concerns about cultural appropriateness, irrelevant application of psychological knowledge, issues of inclusion, and equal opportunities are prompting psychology to revise its traditional tenets and assumptions based on a limited Western European conceptualization of humankind.

Professional socialization can cause confusion and per- plexity in the publication of scholarship of color. Looking through a monocultural glass, dominant psychological publi- cations have discounted and even excluded the divergent experiences and realities of people of color.
