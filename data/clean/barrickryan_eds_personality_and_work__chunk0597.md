## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 193

contrast, high performance on disjunctive tasks requires only a sin- gle team member to excel, suggesting that the highest individual trait score may be representative of the team trait.

The dominance effect from genetics and the maximum and minimum methods from task type both suggest that a team’s traits are often dependent on the individual traits of a single team mem- ber. The additive process of gene combination and the notion of additive tasks are alternative perspectives that lead to the same ap- proach of using the mean of individual trait scores as the team’s trait score. The epistasis effect for gene combination suggests that individual traits may somehow interact to form a team trait, and the notion of compensatory tasks suggests that in some settings, the distribution of individual traits is critical for understanding the team trait.

These forms of aggregation are similar to processes that Koz- lowski and Klein (2000) described. They suggest that a lower-level phenomenon (individual personality) emerges into a higher- level phenomenon (team personality) through composition, a lin- ear combination similar to an additive effect, or compilation, which represents nonlinear interactive combination similar to dominance and epistasis. The three methods can also be viewed from Chan’s typology (1998) as process models of composition in that the team- level parameter is an analogue of parameters at the lower level. The additive process does, however, operate the same as Chan’s additive model, in that it is simply a summation of individual char- acteristics. Combining the genetic perspective with multilevel the- ories thus suggests that individual characteristics aggregate to the team level in several ways.
