## HBR / Digital Article / New Research on How Layoffs Affect the Labor Market

But here’s the rub: recessions induce many business leaders, across a

broad array of geographies and industries, to simultaneously conclude

that it is a prudent time to cut employment. With so many laid-

oﬀ workers desperate to ﬁnd a new job, even healthy ﬁrms may

struggle to adjust their business plans to accommodate new employees.

Unemployed workers, in turn, may be forced to endure a prolonged

spell of joblessness that weakens their skills and attachment to the labor

force. As a result, individually rational decision-making by companies can produce ineﬃcient collective outcomes in the market.

We examined the signiﬁcance of these spillover eﬀects to better

understand what might be done to prevent such rapid deterioration of

labor markets. To do this, we used comprehensive administrative data

from the U.S. Census Bureau on workers’ quarterly employment status

and labor earnings between 1994 and 2020. We studied the variation

in the employment cuts by large national ﬁrms that operate in many

diﬀerent geographic markets and which tend to make company-wide

layoﬀ decisions based on factors, like credit, that are unrelated to the

conditions in any one local market. The large employment share of

these ﬁrms means that their workforce decisions are key drivers of local
