example, a competency model for an Area Sales Manager might include competencies such as sales planning, team working, market competition, industry trends

and strategic thinking (Draganidis and Mentzas, 2006: 56). Briscoe and Hall (1999) identify three main approaches that organizations use to create competency models. The first is the research- based approach in which top-performing executives are asked to give examples of critical behavioral incidents that are crucial for success. The idea is that superior performers are different form good performers and are thought to demonstrate these superior behaviors consistently. Second, a strategy-based approach is based on the idea that a company experiencing changes in its strategic goals will also drive a need for change in the competency requirements for its employees. Finally a value-based approach is based on the view that competency frameworks are derived from the normative cultural values of the organization (Ozcelik and Ferman,

6-

77).

The development of a competency model consists of different steps, required for the creation and validation of the model. The validation process is a means of checking that the competencies predict successful job performance. Table 2 outlines the most commonly used steps in the development of a competency model (Draganidis and Mentzas, 2006: 57- 58).
