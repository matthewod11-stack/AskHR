## The ancient building sits at a low point between two hills, where

the river could turn early manufacturing machines, which were later

powered by electricity and then themselves replaced by machines with

ever-greater automation. Today there are a few workers in the factory,

most of them skilled workers maintaining the machinery or performing

the many tasks that machines cannot do. What struck us most when

looking at the factory is what Smith — and those of us raised on his

doctrines and the endless beneﬁts of scale — are the lessons we may

have missed about the division of labor.
