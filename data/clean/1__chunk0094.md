## Conclusion, Limitations of the Study, and Recommendations for Future Research

This study underscores the urgent need to align AI -driven hiring practices with ADA compliance by addressing systemic biases and promoting inclusive design. The research reveals how AI hiring tools gorithmic bias, opaque decision - disproportionately disadvantage individuals with disabilities due to al making processes, and inadequate accessibility measures. Through the analysis of existing literature, case studies, and regulatory frameworks, this study underscores the necessity for stronger policy interventions, including mandatory bias audits, Explainable AI (XAI), and human oversight in AI hiring processes.

The findings underscore the significance of ethical AI development in emp loyment, drawing on existing literature (e.g., Kaminski, 2023; Marshall et al., 2024; Vogel et al., 2023). The study reveals the legal risks and ethical challenges organizations encounter when deploying AI without sufficient safeguards. It connects ategies for legal frameworks, techn ological advancements, and disability rights advocacy to propose str reducing bias, promoting fair hiring practices, and emphasizing the need for regulatory oversight in AI hiring systems.

for maintaining current findings, as new tools may introduce unforeseen biases or require new mitigation strategies. Future research should address the following key areas to strengthen the field of AI in hiring:

- 1. Comparative Cross-Cultural Analysis: Expanding research beyond the U.S. to examine AI hiring regulations and biases in various global regions can provide valuable insights into best practices for mitigating discrimination.

- 2. Longitudinal Studies on AI Hiring: Investigating the long-term effects of AI-driven hiring on the career mobility and workplace integration of individuals with disabilities as job seekers can provide a deeper understanding of AI’s impact on employment equity.

- 3. Intersectionality in AI Bias Mitigation: Future research should explore how AI hiring tools affect individuals with multiple marginalized identities (e.g., disabled women of color) to develop more comprehensive fairness models.

By addressing these areas, future studies can help bridge existing researc development of fairer, more inclusive AI hiring systems.
