# Downward Communication

Downward communication is that of superior to subordinate or management to employees. The downward communication process in organizations has changed greatly over the years (Brandon, ). Originally, downward communication involved newsletters designed to bolster employee morale by discussing happy events such as the “three B’s”—babies, birthdays, and ballgame scores. Now, however, downward communication is considered a key method not only of keeping employees informed but of communicating vital information needed by employees to perform their jobs. Such communication can be accomplished in many ways, including bulletin boards, policy manuals, newsletters, and intranets.

Bulletin Boards The bulletin board is yet another method of downward communication. The next time you visit an organization, look around for bulletin boards. You will see them everywhere. Their main use, however, is to communicate non- work–related opportunities such as scholarships, optional meetings, and items for sale. Impor- tant information is seldom seen because the bulletin board is not the appro- priate place to post a change of policy or procedure. Still, bulletin boards have the advantage of low cost and wide exposure to both employees and visitors. This is especially true if the boards are placed in high-traffic areas such as out- side restrooms and cafeterias or near time clocks. Electronic bulletin boards, also called in-house message networks, allow the display of even more current information.

Policy Manuals The policy manual is the place for posting important changes in policy or pro- cedure. This manual contains all the rules under which employees must operate. Most manuals are written in highly technical language, although they should be written in a less technical style to encourage employees to read them, as well as to make them easier to understand. Furthermore, the contents of these manu- als are considered binding contracts by courts, so the manuals must be updated each time a policy changes. This usually is done by sending updated pages to employees so that they can replace older material with newer ones. To make this process easier, many organizations punch binder holes in the pages to facilitate their replacement. Sosnin (c) advises that policy manuals should contain the following six disclaimers:
