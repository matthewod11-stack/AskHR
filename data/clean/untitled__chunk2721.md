Research on ethnic minority issues was historically deval- ued in academic circles as not meeting standards for “good research,” and hence ignored in considerations for promotion of faculty doing such research. Furthermore, minority schol- ars often experienced rejection of their submitted manu- scripts on minority samples, based on the criticism that a white sample had not been included, and hence valid conclu- sions could not be drawn.

A combination of the increase in minorities earning doc- toral degrees in psychology, greater attempts by university programs to recruit minorities, and organized activism were among the forces gradually forcing change. What recorded history or historical memory is available provides sources to identify some of the minorities entering psychology in early years (see outline in Final Report, 1997). Possibly because minorities were not always given recognition, some informa- tion is absent.

Francis Sumner was the ﬁrst African American to earn a PhD in psychology from an American university in 1920. In 1933, Inez Prosser became the ﬁrst African American woman to earn a doctoral degree. Robert Chin was the ﬁrst Asian American awarded the PhD degree in 1943. In 1951,
