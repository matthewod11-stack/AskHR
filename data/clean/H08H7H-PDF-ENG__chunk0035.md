Our research shows that the decision to RTO can’t solely be about

building better and stronger relationships because working from home

can beneﬁt coworker relationships in ways that working in the oﬃce

cannot. Thus, while there is a certain magic to being in-person that

we haven’t yet ﬁgured out how to fully replicate virtually, there is

also a magic to working-from-home —perhaps being able to switch the

laundry while you learn new information about your coworkers. This is

a magic that many employees have felt and are not happy about losing,

suggesting that managers may want to be strategic in their RTO policies

and capitalize on the upsides of working remotely.
