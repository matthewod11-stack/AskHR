IV. CONCLUSION In summary, research into several machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, has demonstrated how effective they can all be when it comes to forecasting employee attrition. Its seen Random Forest performs well in managing complex relationships, but Decision Tree shines out as a straightforward option because its natural interpretability. While Support Vector Machines demonstrate remarkable abilities in capturing both linear and non-linear interactions, K-Nearest Neighbors demonstrates its flexibility its openness and and
