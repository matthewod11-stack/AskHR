# to measure.

I see the pendulum existing, but maybe it’s a false dichotomy. Maybe it’s

not empathy versus productivity. Maybe we need smart, caring leaders

who understand the importance of both. And given that that’s very

challenging, they’re open about it being challenging. They’re asking

for help. They’re sharing the burden of caring and excellence with

their teams and considering, again, the fundamentals of what it is the

organization must do well to stay alive in its market, to perform in its

market. And talk about it honestly.

I sometimes think we don’t talk often enough about the fact that work

is work. It’s supposed to be a little bit of work, but that doesn’t mean it

can’t be fun, energizing, collaborative, and full of empathy.
