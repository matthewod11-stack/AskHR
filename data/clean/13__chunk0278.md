## A Multilevel Framework for Work Team Diversity Research

identity theory and leadership research suggest that leaders can forge a common ground for identiﬁcation among diverse team members. Thus leadership styles particularly motivational forms of leadership may be particularly suited to this outcome. In addition, leader-team demographic ﬁt may inﬂuence the leader-member exchange and facilitate more positive interactions between the leader and team members thereby facilitating positive outcomes for teams. Finally, team climate can also be a contextual factor facilitating positive outcomes. To the extent that climate either reﬂects the propensity of team members to collaborate (i.e., a collectivistic orientation), team members, and to feel empowered and psychologically safe to voice differences and learn from different perspec- tives, team climate may serve to reverse the negative effects of diversity considered earlier or strengthen the positive outcomes of diversity such as learning behavior, creativity, and innovation.
