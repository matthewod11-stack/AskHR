## ﬁnd major diﬀerences in experience — for example, older workers

consistently report being paid less than their younger colleagues in

the same roles, or candidates without an Ivy League background are

consistently passed over for promotion compared to their equally

experienced Ivy League-grad colleagues, or neurodivergent workers

are pushed into a more limited set of career tracks compared to their

neurotypical colleagues — we can investigate potential unfairness and

make corrections to policies, processes, or practices to ﬁx the problem.

In one organization I worked with, a senior leader was dealing with

a situation where a manager reporting to him had been accused

of promoting her team members for personal reasons rather than

readiness. Rather than singling out this manager alone for remedial

bias training, I worked with the organization to protect against

discrimination more broadly by formalizing the promotions process:

requiring promotion criteria be transparent, clarifying these criteria to

focus on demonstrated performance rather than assumed potential,

standardizing the evaluation process with rubrics, and upskilling

decision-makers to utilize this process with conﬁdence.

Improving systems rather than “ﬁxing” individuals requires change

management, not a one-time intervention. Luckily, this approach may

resonate strongly with what workers already value. Everyone wants a

workplace free from favoritism and discrimination, where everyone has

the support they need to do their best work and is rewarded fairly for

their eﬀorts. Framing FAIR work in these terms can make it clear that a

healthier workplace is good for everyone, and secure the broad support

needed to change the status quo for the better.
