# Personality of the Group Members

An important factor affecting group performance is the personality of the group members. Meta-analysis results indicate that in general, groups whose members have task-related experience and score high in the personality dimensions of openness to experience and emotional stability will perform better than groups whose members do not have these characteristics (Bell, ). In addition, groups working on intellectual tasks will do better if their group members are bright, and groups working on physical tasks (e.g., sports teams) will do better if their group members score high in the personality dimensions of conscientiousness, extra- version, and agreeableness (Bell, ).

A fascinating study reported by Wilson () demonstrates the importance of personality to group performance—in chickens! A company was trying to determine ways to increase the egg production of chickens kept together in small cages and explored two breeding strategies. One was to take the highest produc- ing individual chicken in each of the cages and breed them for six generations. The other strategy was to take the highest producing group of chickens and let them breed. When the offspring of the nine highest producing individual chick- ens were placed in a group, they became aggressive and six were killed. It seemed that the reason the individual chickens were so productive is that they did so by lowering the production of the other chickens. The offspring of the best group of chickens, however, were not aggressive and produced at a high rate. Thus, there seems to be a genetic predisposition for being an effective group member.
