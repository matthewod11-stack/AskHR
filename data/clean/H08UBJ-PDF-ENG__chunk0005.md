Economists label situations when a decision‑maker’s personal stake in the outcome threatens to cloud objective judgment as “conﬂict of

interest.” Employees might just call it “doing what it takes” or “being

a team player.” It’s what happens when incentives or group dynamics

push people—even subconsciously—to favor a particular outcome that

serves them best. One common distortion this tension produces is

optimism bias: the impulse to downplay real risks and paint a future that

looks brighter than the evidence warrants. In such cases, the question

haunting leaders is obvious: In the face of corporate pressures, how do

you uphold honesty in your team’s decisions?
