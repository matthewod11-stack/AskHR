perceptions, perceived pay fairness is expected to have an impact on individuals’ perceptions of the gender pay gap in a way that the more an individual perceives pay fairness, the less he/she is concerned about pay inequalities and the less he/she perceives the gender pay gap. The following proposition is thus suggested:

Proposition 3: individuals with higher perceived personal pay fairness will perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than individuals with lower personal perceived pay fairness.

Gender: men and women act the way they do in part because of gender socialization (Parsons and Bales, 1956). Several theories including social learning, gender schema and psychoanalytic theories have attempted to clarify the process of gender socialization (Stockard, 1999). All these theories share the assumption that gender socialization leads to the construction of a society where individuals are put into certain social roles. Based on the gender socialization, men and women receive positive reinforcement when they behave in ways appropriate to their gender while receiving negative reinforcement for behaving like the opposite gender (Smith and Rogers, 2000). Furthermore, due to gender socialization, men and women obtain differential roles and positions in organizations.

In line with the gender socialization, Powell and Mainiero (1992) argued that women may lack access to informal communication networks that their male colleagues often possess to obtain knowledge about pay including pay raises, bonuses, and promotions. According to these scholars, women have to rely more on formal procedures and systems to obtain organizational outcomes due to a history of gender discrimination and gender-role stereotyping that has excluded them from fair decision-making process. Furthermore, both Sweeney and McFarlin (1997), and Lee and Farh (1999) suggested that men have been socialized to achieve satisfaction from outcomes, such as pay and knowledge about it, while women have been socialized to achieve satisfaction from the process of interacting and the procedural system in general rather than being keen on the knowledge of pay.

Going along with the gender socialization perspective, I propose that although women are often under-rewarded, they are less sensitive towards the gender pay gap than their male counterparts due to different pay comparison. This tendency occurs since men are more likely to compare themselves with other male and female colleagues working in similar positions outside the organization. Since men tend to be more outcome oriented and women more process oriented, women are expected to perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than men also in part due to their higher level of obtained knowledge about pay of others. The following proposition is thus suggested:

Proposition 4: women will perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than men.

Age: age can also have an impact on the way the gender pay gap is perceived. According to occupational socialization theory (Smith and Rogers, 2000), older individuals are more socialized and are more sensitive towards gender inequality than younger ones. In line with the theory, Paul (2006) demonstrated that older individuals perceive gender pay inequalities to a greater extent than younger ones. Jackson and Grabskin (1988: 622) argued that older individuals are more aware of the costs of living than younger ones due to the “wisdom of experience”. They experience more financial pressures, more child-raising duties and other
