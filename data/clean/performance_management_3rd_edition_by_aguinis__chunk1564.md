# Part III • Employee Development

providing feedback. First, organizations would be depriving employees of a chance to improve their performance. Second, organizations might be stuck with chronic poor performance because employees did not recognize any performance problems and felt justified in continuing to perform at substandard levels. Finally, employees might develop inaccurate perceptions of how their performance is regarded by others.

Given that, overall, feedback systems are beneficial, what can we do to make the

most of them? Consider the following suggestions to enhance feedback:28

- Timeliness. Feedback should be delivered as close to the performance event as possi- ble. For feedback to be most meaningful, it must be given immediately after the event. • Frequency. Feedback should be provided on an ongoing basis, daily if possible. If performance improvement is an ongoing activity, then feedback about performance should also be provided on an ongoing basis.

- Specificity. Feedback should include specific work behaviors, results, and the situation in which these behaviors and results were observed.29 Feedback is not about the employee and how the employee “is,” but about behaviors and results and situations in which these behaviors and results occurred.

- Verifiability. Feedback should include information that is verifiable and accurate. It should not be based on inferences or rumors. Using information that is verifiable leads to more accurate feedback and subsequent acceptance.

- Consistency. Feedback should be consistent. In other words, information about specific aspects of performance should not vary unpredictably between over- whelming praise and harsh criticism.

- Privacy. Feedback should be given in a place and at a time that prevent any potential embarrassment. This applies to both criticism and praise, because some employees, owing to personality or cultural background, may not wish to be rewarded in public.

- Consequences. Feedback should include contextual information that allows the employee to understand the importance and consequences of the behaviors and results in question. For example, if an employee became frustrated and behaved inappropriately with an angry customer and the customer’s complaint was not addressed satisfactorily, feedback should explain the impact of these behaviors (e.g., behaving inappropriately) and results for the organization (e.g., the customer’s problem was not resolved, the customer was upset, the customer was not likely to give repeat business to the organization).

- Description first, evaluation second. Feedback should first focus on describing behaviors and results rather than on evaluating and judging behaviors and results. It is better first to report what has been observed and, once there is agree- ment about what happened, to evaluate what has been observed. If evaluation takes place first, employees may become defensive and reject the feedback.

- Performance continuum. Feedback should describe performance as a continuum, going from less to more in the case of good performance and from more to less in the case of poor performance. In other words, feedback should include information on how to display good performance behaviors more often and poor performance behaviors less often. Thus, performance is a matter of degree, and even the worst performer is likely to show nuggets of good performance that can be described as a starting point for a discussion on how to improve performance.
