# work at Avinsa.

Likewise, separate communication consultants hired by the

company seemed somewhat detached from the nuances of Avinsa’s

transformation. While they provided essential technical expertise,

their suggestions occasionally misaligned with the company’s culture

and overlooked local challenges. As a result, Avinsa’s in-house

communications team decided to ignore several of the external team’s

recommendations and chose not to renew their contract.

Overall, external consultants’ advice should be assessed in light of

the organization’s core values and capabilities, ensuring alignment

and authenticity. This can motivate employees when they see familiar

values reﬂected in new practices.
