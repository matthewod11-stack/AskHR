# Criterion -)evelopmerl

Regardless of the technique used to measure jib performance, the adequacy of the criteria measures is a critical issue. There at.: various types of job performance measures which can emphasize both work outtJut and judgmental data. Work output can be observed and tabulated such as nutaber important committees chaired, number of public service activities conducted and the number of professional presenta- tions and publications. Such measures are seen to be highly objective. In fact, one advocate of such measures in appraising performance of faculty members uses the expression "either you did it or you didn',. "j5 There is little question, however, that judgmental data is unavoidable. Most jc bs require information from superiors who directly and continuously observe the quail y of the work. The distnist of these kinds of measures and the possibilit; of bias make it essential to carefully develop and scale behavioral measures.

In criterion development, job analysis sc-es both a legal and technical purpose. The legal role is well established in both the 'Uniform Guidelines" and in a series of court decisions. A thorough and competent jo) analysis establishes the rational link between the content of the job and the content of the performance measure. According to Donald Schwartz, EEOC personnel research psychologist, "the absence of a job analysis is fatal to a validity study in a court challenge." 16

In regard to the technical or professional requirements for job analysis, there are a number of acceptable methods. In selecting a method or technique, the focus should be on ensuring that the method or combination of methods representatively samples significant job tasks Although it is highly desirable, it is not possible t.) specify one clear, suitable, standard means for meeting all the technical and legal considerations of a job analysis.!' The lack of such a standard, however, should not be viewed as a major problem.
