## Points in quadrants I and II ÷ Total points in all quadrants

If the percentage from the first formula is higher than that from the second, our proposed test should increase selection accuracy. If not, it is probably better to stick with the selection method currently used.

As an example, look again at Figure .. There are  data points in quadrant I,  in quadrant II,  in quadrant III, and  in quadrant IV. The percentage of time we expect to be accurate in the future would be:

II + IV _________ = I + II + IV

 +  _____________  +  + + 

=  ___ 

= .

To compare this figure with the test we were previously using to select

employees, we compute the satisfactory performance baseline:

I + II _____________ = I + II + III + IV

 +  _____________ =  +  +  + 

 ___  = .

Using the new test would result in a % increase in selection accuracy

[. − . = . ÷ .] over the selection method previously used.
