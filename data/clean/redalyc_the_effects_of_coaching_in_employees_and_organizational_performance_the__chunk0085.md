## participants share and serves as a moral norm of action.

In the first part of this work, we presented coaching as a process of improvement that

develops and improves the skills of coachees and whose core is the relationship that

participants establish during the process. The second contribution of this work is related to the

effects of organisational support and the coaching process on the individual performance of

coachees. The transactions that occur during the coaching process generate a number of

benefits and costs for those involved in such a relationship. According to our research results,

we can conclude that when the coaching process is conducted according to the criteria

proposed here, both the coach and coachee perceive important benefits, and the coachees

demonstrates improved individual performance, as Hypotheses 1 and 2 postulate.

The third contribution of this work is that it provides insight into the question of whether this

improvement in individual performance as a result of coaching has an effect on organisational

performance, sales increases and productivity growth. We study these relationships from the

most recent perspective of the RBV. Coaching processes confer on individuals a number of

attributes that are converted into valuable capital for firms, making it difficult for competitors

to imitate or copy them and thus making the competitive advantage generated more

sustainable. These research results provide evidence that the individual benefits derived from

the coaching process will translate into benefits for organisations because individual benefits

indeed have an effect on organisational performance, sales increases and productivity growth,

as Hypotheses 3 and 4 postulate. Consequently, on the basis of this theoretical framework and
