## company, not just product development, at an ever-greater scale.

When Apple was smaller, it may have been reasonable to expect leaders

to be experts on and immersed in the details of pretty much everything

going on in their organizations. However, they now need to exercise

greater discretion regarding where and how they spend their time and

eﬀorts. They must decide which activities demand their full attention to

detail because those activities create the most value for Apple. Some of

those will fall within their existing core expertise (what they still need

to own), and some will require them to learn new areas of expertise.

Activities that require less attention from the leader can be pushed

down to others (and the leaders will either teach others or delegate in

cases where they aren’t experts).
