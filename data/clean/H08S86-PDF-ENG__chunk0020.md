## A new calendar or ﬁscal year—more than just a marker of time—is

imbued with meaning for people, often making them feel like they’ve

been given a fresh start. At the beginning of these cycles, employees

are more open-minded and willing to learn new skills or accept new

ideas. As previous research has shown, atypical CEOs are more likely to

enact major strategic change; we propose that aligning ﬁrm cycles with

this period of heightened openness means that atypical CEOs’ strategic

initiatives are more likely to be accepted or enacted. We believe this

helps explain ﬁrms’ stronger performance when atypical CEOs’ start

dates are phase entrained.
