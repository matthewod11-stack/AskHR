To elaborate, most senior executives strive to hit the bullseye. However,

once managers identify the actions required to meet their assigned

target, they often stop, seeing no need to identify additional steps or

strive to improve performance further. Worse, in companies that have

deployed multiple rounds of targets over a short time, executives may

have a perverse incentive to avoid exceeding targets, fearing it will raise the baseline and make hitting subsequent targets more diﬃcult.

Successful companies think of targets as minimum performance

requirements and often refer to them as such to avoid the stigma

now attached to the term targets. In these cases, leadership is explicit

about the minimum hurdle the company must clear and encourages

executives to deliver even more, typically reinforced through incentives.

This new mindset uniﬁes the organization, pushing everyone to identify

new opportunities to drive higher levels of performance.
