but rather from a leader’s need to stave oﬀ their own anxiety about

performance challenges. They refer to this as “defensive organizing.”

I spoke with study coauthor Gianpiero Petriglieri, who told me that

defensive organizing makes its appearance in four phases. First, the

leader has concern over some persistent performance challenge that

hasn’t abated. Then, the leader gathers people together to discuss the

problem and identify possible remedies. Petriglieri says:

People grasp onto an idea like a life raft in the storm. That idea

could be forming a task force, adopting new technology, or some

other very attractive notion. As soon as that idea gets brought in,

everyone thinks, “This is amazing! It’s absolutely going to work.”

This uncritical embrace of an idea generates a sudden shift from

concern to enthusiasm, making everyone feel joined together against

the problem that’s “out there” somewhere.

Over time, the idea becomes more widely adopted, and more people get

involved in order to build buy-in. But as the idea fails to improve the

performance challenge, intensiﬁed eﬀorts devolve into the third phase

of defensive organizing—exhaustion that overrides the burst of initial

enthusiasm—and eventually settles into the ﬁnal phase: widespread

resentment for the wasted energy and resources. “The whole time, the

initiative’s real purpose is to diﬀuse and displace leadership’s anxiety

over the performance challenge they can’t resolve,” reﬂects Petriglieri.

“And as things slow down, they once again feel the worry, and then have

to ramp up the machine again and do more, causing more exhaustion,

keeping the vicious cycle in motion.”

If you’re sponsoring change to address some stubborn performance

challenge and suddenly ﬁnd yourself in a groundswell of enthusiasm for

an idea that feels like a silver bullet, don’t get excited and relieved—get
