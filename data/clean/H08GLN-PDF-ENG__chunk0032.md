# challenge?

Designing failure tasks is not about setting employees up to fail, it’s

about creating opportunities for them to explore, learn, and succeed in

the long run. Productive failure experiments intentionally design tasks

that challenge employees, allowing them to fail in a structured and

safe way that leads to growth. By carefully balancing performance and

learning goals, crafting tasks with built-in roadblocks, and fostering a

culture that views failure as a necessary step toward innovation, ﬁrst-

time managers can unlock the true potential of their teams.
