Beyond selection, other functional areas of human resources would beneﬁt from considering job performance over time. The purpose of many human resource interventions is to improve employee performance. For example, pay-for-performance is supposed to affect motivation to yield better performance; training programs are supposed to affect motivation or abilities to elicit higher performance. All of these interventions implicitly involve the passage of time to achieve the desired results. Given what we know about performance trends, simply looking at before/after change scores is incomplete with regard to understanding job performance over time. Longitudinal designs are needed to control for current performance trends to determine if a human resource intervention truly has the intended effect. This leads to a ﬁfth set of research questions that would behoove future research on job performance over time to address.

(cid:4) What are the temporal validities of common selection devices (e.g., unstructured interview, structured interview, cognitive ability tests, personality tests, assessment centers, integrity tests)?

(cid:4) How do compensation systems (e.g., pay policy, pay hierarchy, bonuses, raises, pay-for-performance linkages, group-based incentives) inﬂuence job performance trends?
