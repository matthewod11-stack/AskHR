(a) Owner: Can be owned by None or by a Consortium based on the Regulatory and Privacy requirements of the Application. (b) Transaction Volumes in TPS: Refers to the theoretical maximum amount of Transactions Per Second that a Consensus Protocol can achieve as mentioned in Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Algorithms[18]. As described by Thurimella et. Al in [22] a key factor going down for Public Blockchains is the ability to support higher Volumes of Transactions. (c) Anonymity Requirements: Based on Business

Requirements, data in the Blockchain can either be available for read to all Users or to a select group of users based on Access Rights. As mentioned in Global Benchmarking Study[7], Transactionsdata need to have a certain level of privacy; on the contrary, in pub lic blockchains, by design all transactions should be visible to every participant. (d) Need for Shared Write Access: Based on the Business requirements, some or all Users will have Write Access. In the consortium, it is possible that Read Access is granted to all members, but Write Access is granted only to limited Super Users.
