# Matthew Stolpe (Stolpe, 2022) describes the Procedural Employee Experience as the

systems and processes that employees use while working for the company including

the actual work they are doing and how the company evaluates performance. The

phenomenon described below is universal, occurring in companies of all sizes and

across all sectors. With all the good things that new technology has brought to the

modern workplace, there has been an unintended and perhaps inevitable side effect:

employees everywhere are stressed out. Deloitte summarized their findings from

survey in Human Capital Trends (Schwarz, 2014) where 65% of executives rated

overwhelmed employees as most important trend and 44% explained that they were

not ready to deal with it. In addition to that, the companies who are attempting to deal

with it are not doing a great job as well. The Procedural EX suffers mainly from work

interruptions from social media according to 57% of employee who participate on this

research, and 72% reported that they lack access to the necessary data inside the

constraints of their own organization. Based on available research and existing

literature, the Procedural EX is the area of EX which is focused on the most. Many

companies are maximizing their outcomes by improving their processes and

structures, and implementing new technologies, realizing that great Procedural EX

motivates employees to be real-time problem solvers in field, no matter what their role

and where they are located in the organizational structure.
