# 1.(cid:32) Introduction

During the past decade, various researchers have analyzed sports management in Spain. The changes that have taken place in our society have pushed sports centers towards more organized and efficient management. This was achieved through adequate planning and programming of activities and a constant effort to optimize all resources: material, human and economic (Moreno & Guti√©rrez, 1999). The current crisis is a new reality, not only economic, but also social and in the sports sector, where management is faced with the challenge of optimizing diminishing resources. The aim of this study was to determine the transition of leadership in sports institutions.
