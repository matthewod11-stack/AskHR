the critical value of the variable of interest, the temperature of a building. A sensor in the thermostat monitors the tem- perature, and when it falls below or above critical value, the controller activates the heating or cooling system. When the temperature moves back to its critical value, the sensor detects this and the controller turns off the heat pump. The notion of feedback is that a system, whether living or mechanical, detects a state of the world, acts to alter the state of the world, which alteration is detected, changing the behavior of the system, in a complete feedback loop. A thermostat plus heat pump is thus a purposive system, acting ï¬‚exibly to pursue a simple goal. It is, of course at the same time a machine whose behavior could be explained in purely causal, physical, terms. Teleology and mechanism are not incompatible.
