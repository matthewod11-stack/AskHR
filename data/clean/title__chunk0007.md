# Case study: Firm A

Firm A is a consulting company with about 500 employees. The managers of Firm A want to understand the drivers of information ﬂows between departments. They have identiﬁed dysfunctions in the relationship between a number of depart- ments since critical information (about practices, protocols and projects) often does not ﬂow as it should from one to another. When individuals belonging to the different depart- ments are debriefed regarding such cooperation failures, the answer tends to be that it is the fault of the other department’s people. For a behavioral economist, this appears to be a prob- lem of between-group cooperation and intergroup bias (i.e. the tendency to favor members of one’s own group in detri- ment of members of other groups). The proposed assessment thus focused on the relationships between individuals within and across departments in Firm A.

The planned evaluation consisted of having the employ- ees participate in an online experiment lasting for about 40 minutes. One out of every ten participants would be randomly selected to receive the real payment associated with one of his/her decisions (also randomly chosen) through bank trans- fer. The expected payoff of the selected employees was nearly e100. Employees would never learn the decisions made by other employees (i.e. a single blind procedure).

Note that a random sample of workers is often enough to obtain reliable evaluations, in particular, when the goal is to infer which employees’ attributes are able to predict one or several KPIs. In this case, however, all workers should be assessed since one of the project main goals is to ﬁgure out if some speciﬁc individuals represent information (i.e. coopera- tion) bottlenecks so that intervention recommendations can put the focus on them.

Based on previous literature, the key measures to be ob- tained from the participants are the following: intertemporal preferences, social networks, social preferences and inter- group bias. These measures allow to infer characteristics of the individuals involved, learn about the nature of their rela- tionships, and therefore help design interventions to reduce between-group conﬂict and increase cooperation.

Intertemporal preferences are included in the assessment because there is evidence that within-group cooperation and coordination (i.e. group synergy) is higher in groups of long-run oriented, patient people (Esp´ın, Correa, and Ruiz-
