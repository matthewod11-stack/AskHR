## group affiliations within a firm, and across firms.

To some extent, firms can manage group creation through sorting (selecting “our

kind of person” in hiring) and other organizational practices. For example, if helping

customers foo much is bad for the firm, it may use job rotation to keep its workers

from becoming too helpful with favored customers. The sociology literature, how-

ever, provides numerous examples of firms misestimating group effects, such as

Roy’s (1952) famous study of a small-parts machine shop in Chicago. In this shop,

the management designed task-specific piece rates such that for all the different

jobs a certain monetary target could be reached with the same “effort.” Roy’s study

demonstrates that workers were able to mislead management and induce piece rates,

for which meeting the target was very easy. The workers imposed strong sanctions

on anybody attempting to deviate and to exert more effort.

Evolutionary psychology provides an interesting way to speculate about groups

and firms. Psychologists think of some kinds of groups as “essential,” which means

11Group dynamics can also induce the opposite bias, a “black-sheep effect.” Unpopular in-group

members receive higher punishment than unpopular out-group members (Marques et al. 1988), especially

if peer pressure is high. Another important caveat is its susceptibility to the experimental framing (Hertel
