Now, a version of this idea is making a comeback in some companies,

and we expect to see it in more. It will require not only an

appreciation and understanding of AI, but also a renewed appreciation

increasingly possible that it can enable the kind of radical redesign of

business processes originally envisaged by reengineering’s proponents.
