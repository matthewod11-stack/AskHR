In my role spearheading pay equity audit practices for

Trusaic, apurpose-driven technology company, I assisted in developing thepay equity maturity model to help employers understand wherethey are regarding pay equity. It’s a three-level framework thatallows organizations to evaluate their current pay practices,progress, and long-term goals.To start, leaders should ask themselves some basic questions. Doyou have pay equity-related policies or initiatives? If so, are theydocumented and are they being measured? How do you involveyour employees? Do you actively communicate progress to all ofyour stakeholders, including employees, investors, the public,and/or your local community? Have you established your payequity goals? How are you tracking your progress towards thosegoals? Is there accountability?Your answers to these questions will be key to identifying whereyour organization falls in the model. As you evaluate your payequity efforts and ultimately determine your position, let thesequestions guide your progress. With some regularity, revisit themand see if you’ve advanced to the next level of the model.Below we outline the three levels, discuss the key factorsdistinguishing each level, and identify how businesses can ascendthe model to become a true fair-pay workplace.
