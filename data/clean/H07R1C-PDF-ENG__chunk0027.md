# Cognitivity

We’re calling this third set of caregiving skills “cognitivity,” building

on the concept of cognitive labor, the term often used to describe the

invisible work critical to running a household (sometimes referred to as

the mental load or emotional burden). But the home isn’t the only place

that requires cognitive labor; this is also a key component of smooth

workplace operations. Anticipating needs, spotting small problems

before they turn into big ones, putting measures in place to avoid issues

down the road, and always staying a step ahead are all examples of

cognitivity. People with high cognitivity manage disruptions and take

initiative to complete tasks with little or no direction.

Another way to think about cognitivity is “gluework.” Coined by

engineer Tanya Reilly, gluework is the in-between stuﬀ that holds

people and processes together, which is the foundation of a company’s

culture. In a workplace, this can mean making sure there’s a backup

plan if the technology doesn’t sync for the big pitch, considering dietary

restrictions for the lunch order, taking the meeting notes, and even

running the ERGs. These are often non-promotable tasks — invisible

but critical, and often done by women. Caregivers are required to

maintain a high level of cognitivity since they act as the control tower
