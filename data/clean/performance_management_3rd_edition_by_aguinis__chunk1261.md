Chapters 4 and 5 described operational details about how to measure performance. Chapter 6 described operational details about appraisal forms and the process of providing performance ratings. This chapter, the last one in Part II, continues to address operational issues in implementing a performance management system. Specifically, it addresses the steps needed before the system is put in place, such as setting up good communication and appeals procedures that will gain system acceptance, implementing training programs to minimize rating errors, and pilot testing the system. Finally, the chapter describes how to monitor the system once it is in place to make sure it is working properly as well as the possibility of implementing the system online.
