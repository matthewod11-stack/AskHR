leadership and extra-role behaviors. On the one hand, the results of our study found that inclusive leadership exerts a positive impact on academics’ OCB. The results are confirmed by previous studies in the private sector which suggested that inclusive leaders’ behaviors positively contribute to followers’ discretionary behaviors in the workplace (Carmeli et al., 2010). On the other hand, the results found that inclusive leadership demonstrates a positive relationship with academics’ IWB. These results were also consistent with previous business studies examining the leadership-innovative work behavior relationship (Javed et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2019). This suggests that the supportive behaviors of the leader encourage employees’ voluntary behaviors and enhance the innovation behaviors generated by employees. Given these results, our study provides strong evidence of the effectiveness of SETandrelationalleadershiptheoryinexplaininghowleadershipcanencourageemployees’ positive behaviors and outcomes due to the social exchanges between the leader and the follower. The results also suggest that inclusive leadership and organizational learning were positively associated. These results were in line with previous empirical evidence (Hsiao and Chang, 2011; Tran and Choi, 2019), which found that leader openness and support would create a culture of organizational learning, due to information sharing and the provision of continuous learning opportunities. Inaddition, our results found that organizational learning was positively related to OCB and IWB. These results were consistent with prior studies in (cid:1) Skerlavaj et al., 2010; Tran and Choi, 2019). This implies that the existence business settings ( ofalearningenvironmentwillbepositivelyperceivedbyemployeesandhencemotivatethem to demonstrate extra-role behaviors.

Finally, the study uncovered the role organizational learning can play as an intervening mechanism in the relationship between inclusive leadership and academics’ discretionary behaviors in higher education. Our results found that the relationship between inclusive leadership and extra-role behaviors is not straightforward, and organizational learning significantly mediated the relationship between inclusive leadership and both IWB and OCB.

In addition, the study contributed to the limited body of literature of organizational learning in higher education (Dee and Lei(cid:1)syt_e, 2016; Voolaid and Ehrlich, 2017), by examining its potential intervening role with regard to the relationship between inclusive leadership and academics’ discretionary behaviors.
