# Literary Development

The availability of professional literature is among the few symbols of professionalization observable in this period, though no journals or books appear to have existed speciÔ¨Å- cally for school psychologists. To the extent practitioners sought professional information, they would have read the available psychology journals (e.g., American Journal of Psychology, Pedagogical Seminary, Psychological Bulletin) and education journals (e.g., School and Society, Journal of Educational Psychology). Perhaps the most relevant journal was The Psychological Clinic, founded by Witmer in 1907.
