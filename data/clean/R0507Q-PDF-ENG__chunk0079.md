of the output from the production process using market prices and

subtracted the expenses of raw materials, energy, and capital consumed

in the production process. To approximate the cost of producing out-of-

100%.

The daily financial report gave operators powerful feedback and motivation

and guided their quality and productivity efforts. The department head

understood that it is not always possible to improve quality, reduce

energy consumption, and increase throughput simultaneously; trade-offs

are usually necessary. He wanted the daily financial statement to guide

those trade-offs. The difference between the input consumed and the

output produced indicated the success or failure of the employeesâ€™ efforts

on the previous day. The operators were empowered to make decisions that

might improve quality, increase productivity, and reduce consumption of
