many employees. Those which take a broader view of the individual and their future may be more effective for encouraging flexibility and have a higher impact on employees’.

The CIPD survey of performance management found that over two-thirds (67 per cent) of respondents agreed that the most important aspect of performance management is that of setting challenging and stretching developmental goals.

The use of personal development planning and the need to revisit performance management systems was highlighted by comments made by First Direct, which stated that personal development planning ‘details the skills required for different roles based on core competencies. It’s an in-house system so it needs constant refreshing, and we need to make sure that that is up to date and reflecting skills required in the business now and in the next five years’ (Armstrong & Baron, 2005, p.97).

Armstrong and Baron (2005) also found that most organisations indicate that they expect employees covered by the development planning process to prepare and implement plans. However, in some organisations PDP is encouraged but it is not obligatory ‘on the grounds that to insist too strongly on the completion of forms seems to be inconsistent with the principle of self-managed learning’ (ibid., p.99). Not all employees are interested in career progression, but steps are often taken to encourage these employees to look at what development is available to them, whatever their level. And a number of research studies have shown links between career and skills development and flexible working and levels of customer service delivery.

As with appraisal, some organisations have different approaches to PDP as well as to appraisal for different types and levels of staff. It is relatively common for example to have distinct development arrangements and competency frameworks for senior managers and leaders, although management and supervisory skills would still be a very common component in generic competency frameworks. Approaches will often be simpler too, at lower levels in an organisation. But although surveys do show that levels of PDP coverage decline for lower paid and skilled jobs, generally employers with these types of process endeavour to apply them to all of their employees.

Wilson et al. (2000) recognises that the individual is the ‘most knowledgeable person about the work performance and should be the most important source of information about their achievements and areas for development (Murphy and Cleveland, 1995). They suggested by increasing responsibility for appraisal, greater commitment to the process and motivation could be fostered. Wilson et al. (2000) research provides recommendations for conducting appraisals including:

assessment, promotion or pay discussions.
