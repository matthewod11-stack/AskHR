# Imagine the following situations:

7

Jean Davis and Maria McDuffie have worked as customer service representatives at Fuller Technologies for the past two years. Jean loves her job and wants to stay with Fuller until she retires in ten years. Maria hates her job, uses all of her available sick days, and would leave in a heartbeat if she could only find a job that paid as well. Rhonda Beall recently met with a career adviser to chart a new course for her life. She hates her current job and has hated every job she has ever had. She is hoping that the career adviser can find “the job” for her. David Spoto loves his job and can’t wait to get to work in the morning. He loves to work, loves his current job, and has loved every job he has ever had. Darnell Johnson, human resources (HR) director for Simmons Enterprises, is frustrated because his company has the highest turnover rate in the area. Even more frustrating is that employees stay with Simmons just long enough to gain experience and then leave for lower pay with Raynes Manufacturing, another local employer.

This chapter will help you answer these questions about job satisfaction—the attitude an employee has toward her job—and organizational commitment—the extent to which an employee identifies with and is involved with an organization.
