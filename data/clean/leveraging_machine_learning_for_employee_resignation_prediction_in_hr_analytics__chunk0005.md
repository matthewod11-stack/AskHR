## Leveraging Machine Learning for Employee Resignation Prediction in HR Analytics

likely to stay with the company. On the other hand, low job satis- faction levels can be an important predictor of a(cid:2386)rition. Salary is a highly signi(cid:2647)cant feature. Low salary levels compared to industry standards or the employee‚Äôs perceived value can a(cid:2386)ract him/her to search for be(cid:2386)er-paying alternative jobs.

In addition, a graph structure is used to expose the intricate relationships between the employees. Let G = (V,E) be the graph, where E represents the collection of edges. Each edge in E denotes the interactions between employees. (cid:2399)ese interactions can take various forms, such as collaboration on projects, communication within teams, or social relationships within the workplace. For example, employees who have strong collaborative relationships with their colleagues may be more engaged and commi(cid:2386)ed to the organization, thus less likely to leave. On the other hand, negative interactions or con(cid:2648)icts can contribute to job dissatisfaction and potentially lead to a(cid:2386)rition.

(cid:2399)e set V consists of vertices (nodes), each of which corresponds to an individual employee. Every employee i ‚àà V corresponds to a feature vector xi ‚àà Rd, in which d is the number of features. As mentioned earlier, these features can include age, job satisfaction, salary, and many other relevant factors.

(cid:2399)e ultimate aim is to forecast, for every employee i, the a(cid:2386)rition label yi, where yi ‚àà {0,1}. To achieve this, sophisticated machine - learning algorithms and data - analysis techniques need to be applied. (cid:2399)ese methods must take into account both the individual features of each employee and the complex network of interac- tions among them. By leveraging this combined information, more accurate predictions of employee a(cid:2386)rition can be made, enabling organizations to proactively implement strategies to retain valuable employees and manage their human resources more e(cid:2646)ectively.

3.2 Graph Attention Network (GAT) Our model is based mostly on the Graph A(cid:2386)ention Network (GAT), which learns the signi(cid:2647)cance of surrounding nodes in the graph by means of a(cid:2386)ention mechanisms. Using learnt a(cid:2386)ention weights from a node‚Äôs neighbors, the GAT model aggregates data.

Aggregatingthecharacteristicsofsurroundingnodesupdatesthe representation h(l) of node i at layer in a GAT model. (cid:2399)e a(cid:2386)ention i mechanism computes a weight for every neighbor‚Äôs contribution to the changed node representation. One computes the a(cid:2386)ention coe(cid:2649)cient ùõºij between node i and its neighbor node j by means of this:
