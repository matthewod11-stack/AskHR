# Practical applications of basic insights

One key application of the information obtained with the mentioned experimental tools is to compare the characteristics of different groups. It is of great interest to know which are the variables that distinguish, for example, consulting from ﬁnancial sector workers, one’s own workforce from that of competing companies, or people at top management levels from people at secondary management levels 4. Depending on the circumstances, a company could want to hire the types of employees which are, or are not, in its standard workforce (as compared to competing companies for instance) or reassign people between departments in order to reach the desired combination of types.

At a more individual level, let us put an example of how simple measurements can help managers design appropriate incentives. In a group of 20 salesmen, a new compensation scheme has been implemented but the results are not as good as expected and some workers even decreased their sales after its implementation. The novel incentive consists of a e200 reward for the worker with the top sales in the last month. A correlational analysis between the productivity change (i.e. sales after minus sales before the implementation, which represents here the KPI under scrutiny) and the assessed measures of time, risk and social preferences can result in the following outcomes, which allow to understand the reasons for the unsatisfactory results and, therefore, intervene:

- Is the incentive too delayed? If the individuals with worse KPI values are those displaying more short-run orientation, the incentive can be changed from monthly to weekly realization (e.g. e50 for the one with top sales in the last week).

4 These differences arise, at least in part, due to self-selection of people into occupations or sectors. Self-selection (that can compromise the validity of particular ﬁndings; see Exadaktylos et al. (2013)) can in this way be taken advantage of.

- Is the incentive too volatile? If the individuals with worse KPI values are those displaying more risk aver- sion, the probability of someone getting the incentive can be increased (e.g. e20 to the 10 workers with top monthly sales).

- Is the incentive too unequal? If the individuals with worse KPI values are those displaying more inequality aversion, the incentive can be made more equitable (e.g. e10 for every worker if the sales exceed last month’s sales).
