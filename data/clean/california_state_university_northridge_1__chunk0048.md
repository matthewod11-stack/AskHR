# terminlltion.

Chapter three examines the origin of the at-will employment doctrine and its

exceptions. The exact origins of the doctrine cannot be clearly traced, but have had a

strong presence in the American force in the past. Currently, the doctrine is used in 49

states and is on the decline, based on many court challenges, some of which are listed in

have been taken to court for terminating an older employer, who has a relatively high

salary and a reasonable benefit package, in exchange for a younger employee. However, if

the older worker is terminated for incompetence, then there is no claim. Another

challenge has come before the court, are claims brought by employees for violation of the

American with Disabilities Act (ADA). With the ADA, the employer will not hire an

employee who falls under this category, so there will not be a need to make reasonable

accommodations to the work environment. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits

discrimination based on race, religion, national origin or sex. The participation clause

under Title VII, allows for the protection of those who are directly or indirectly involved
