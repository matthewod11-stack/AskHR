# Self-Monitoring Personality

In addition to guiding individual thinking and behavior, motives are shaped by dispositional factors such as personality. One partic- ular personality construct with demonstrated relevance (validity) in organizational contexts is self-monitoring (Day, Schleicher, Unck- less, & Hiller, 2002; Snyder & Copeland, 1989). An underlying as- sumption of the self-monitoring construct is that people differ in the extent that they monitor (observe, regulate, and control) the public appearance of self they display in social settings and in cre- ating and managing their interpersonal relationships (Snyder, 1974, 1987). Interesting and somewhat unique aspects of self-monitoring as a personality construct are the emphases on the conceptualization and representation of self in social situations and two separate, dis- tinct, and independent self-monitoring orientations (Gangestad & Snyder, 1985). High self-monitors tend to be pragmatic in present- ing themselves in interpersonal situations in that they regulate their behavior to promote situationally appropriate interaction outcomes.
