Viewing their colleagues—and their relationships with these colleagues

—with fresh eyes motivated our research participants to interact

with colleagues in ways that both deepened their existing positive

relationships and forged new ones. For instance, participants described

reaching out to colleagues who they would have previously avoided,

such as leaders who were far more senior to them in the organization.

They also would speak more candidly and openly to these colleagues. This process produced powerful advantages for leaders and their staﬀ,

which we outline below.
