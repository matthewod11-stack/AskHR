# product innovation.

Drawing insights from Cappelli’s (2008a; 2008b) contribution, we recognise that

the talent pool should be focused on managing the risks- the costs associated with

outcomes that are difficult to predict- associated with pivotal positions. The key risks

include; the potential mismatch between employees and skills, i.e. too few employees to

meet business demands or too many employees resulting in redundancies; equally the

failure to retain talent resulting in a loss in the investment development initiatives. These

challenges are illustrated, and indeed exasperated, by the volatile nature of the global

economic climate in the modern age. Since Capppelli’s work was published in early

2008, the economic climate has altered significantly and his assertions on the limited

availability of talent in the external labour market seem less relevant in the current global

economic crisis. However history tells us that such economic trends are cyclical and there

is a strong likelihood that the situation will revert in time. Such an illustration provides

further support for the idea of shorter planning horizons with regard to talent

management. “Years-long programs for developing talent create a false sense of accuracy

and no longer make sense” (Cappelli, 2008b: 9).

Thus without wishing to be overly prescriptive we argue that in developing talent

pools the following factors would facilitate their effective development. Firstly,

organisations should combine internal development and external recruitment in filling

15

talent pools (Cappelli, 2008a). This facilitates the management of quantitative risks

associated with ensuring there is sufficient talent to meet organisational needs and not an

oversupply- which represents a waste in resources. It also facilitates the management of

qualitative risks associated with ensuring that the organisation has the requisite skill set

required at a point in time. Secondly, it is clear that for organisations, it is more effective

to develop talent within the broader context of the organisation, rather than with a

particular succession role in mind. This prevents developing employees to fit narrow,

specialised roles but rather, once developed employees can be developed with broader

competencies which would fit a range of roles (Cappelli, 2008b).
