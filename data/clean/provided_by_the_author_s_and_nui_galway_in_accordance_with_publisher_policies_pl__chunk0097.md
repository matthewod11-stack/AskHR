# 3.0 Conclusion

Given the high level of interest in the concept of talent management over the past

decade, it is somewhat paradoxical that it remains relatively poorly defined and lacking in

theoretical underpinning. This review of the current body of literature suggests that from

a theoretical point of view, the area of talent management is in its infancy and a

significant degree of theoretical advancement is required. The contribution of this paper

is two fold; to develop a clear and concise definition of strategic talent management, and

.propose a theoretical model of strategic talent management. In doing so we draw insights

from a number of discreet literature bases. The paper aims to aid future research in the

area of talent management though (1) helping to clarify the conceptual boundaries of

talent management and (2) providing a theoretical framework which can help in framing

their research efforts in the area. Additionally, it should aid managers in engaging with

some of the issues they face with regard to talent management.

This paper thus represents the elucidation of a research agenda in the area of

talent management. While there have been some useful theoretical contributions to date

(see Boudreau, and Ramstad, 2007; Cappelli, 2008), heretofore the theoretical

foundations of talent management have been relatively sparse. If talent management is to

gain more mainstream acceptance then the theoretical foundations which underpin it must

be advanced.

Our definition of strategic talent management --as activities and processes that

involve the systematic identification of key positions which differentially contribute to

the organization’s sustainable competitive advantage, the development of a talent pool of

26

high potential and high performing incumbents to fill these roles, and the development of

a differentiated human resource architecture to facilitate filling these positions with

competent incumbents and to ensure their continued commitment to the organization --

emphasises the identification of pivotal positions as the point of departure for strategic

talent management systems. For an organisation to fully exploit the potential of their

internal talent, they must first identify those positions within the organisation which have

the potential to differentially impact on performance. It is only then that the emphasis

shifts to filling those positions. In this regard we argue that the key is the development of

a talent pool of high potential and high performing employees to fill these pivotal

positions. Finally, we point to the requirement to support both of these stages with a

differentiated HR architecture to maximise the potential for exploiting the talent pools.

We propose that organisations which apply strategic talent management systems

in this way will achieve improved performance. However, rather than suggest that

strategic talent management leads directly to these firm level outcomes, we introduce a

number of mediating variables to reflect the significant of attitudes and behaviours of the

organisation’s talent pool in achieving this outcome. These variable recognise the

importance of the talent pool in achieving financial performance. We hope our definition

and framework for strategic talent management will assist and motivate future

researchers on talent management. Future research efforts in the area could empirically

test the model presented in the current paper.
