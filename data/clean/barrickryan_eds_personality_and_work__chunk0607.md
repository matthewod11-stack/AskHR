# Direct Effects

The inﬂuence of individual-level personality on team-level person- ality represents a cross-level direct effect. This effect is best seen as a mixed determinant model because the individual-level traits are expected to interact with team- and organization-level constructs to inﬂuence team-level personality. Nevertheless, the traits of individ- uals are expected to have a direct effect on the team-level trait.

Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability should operate in teams much as they do at the individual level: more is better. Of in- creased interest across levels are the interpersonal traits. Because individual Agreeableness and Extraversion appear to inﬂuence the team traits in a dominant fashion, one individual can have a sub- stantial inﬂuence on team traits. These traits thus take on increased importance in team settings, primarily because of the direct inﬂu- ence on team-level constructs.

The direct effects model thus highlights the inﬂuence of indi- vidual traits on team traits and thereby on team performance. Most important, this model highlights the importance of caution when determining the process by which individual-level traits aggregate to inﬂuence the individual trait. Because some traits aggregate in a dominant fashion, they will take on increased importance in team settings. For instance, a full understanding of the utility of Agree- ableness as a selection predictor requires cross-level research that examines its impact not only on individual performance but also on team-level performance. Research related to Extraversion also clearly illustrates the need for careful analysis before assuming that an increase in performance at the individual level translates
