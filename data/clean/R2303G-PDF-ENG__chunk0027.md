## a culture of collaboration and psychological safety in his leadership

team, which included Rajiv. Keen to follow the lead of his boss, Rajiv

replicated the eﬀort with his own unit. Though he initially did so in

a perfunctory, “tick the box” manner, he was surprised to ﬁnd that

he and his team were having more-open conversations. He also began

to receive candid feedback on his leadership style—which, he learned,

instilled fear and encouraged silence. Rajiv turned to an external coach,

assuming the “ﬁx” was a simple matter of picking up better listening

skills. But the coach helped him recognize a big disconnect between

how he saw himself and how others saw him and made him see how

deeply rooted, pervasive, and alienating his controlling tendencies had

become. His “aha!” moment—the real beginning of his journey—came

when he realized just how much time and eﬀort he would have to devote

to improving the way he worked with others.

In our experience many leaders underestimate the extent of change

required and need the help and perspective of a trusted partner—an

adviser, a mentor, or a coach. Not all of them reach the departure stage.
