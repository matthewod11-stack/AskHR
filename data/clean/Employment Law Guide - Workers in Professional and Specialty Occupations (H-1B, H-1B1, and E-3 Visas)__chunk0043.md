Payroll records for the nonimmigrant workers and other employees in the occupational classiﬁcation must be maintained for a

period of three years from the date of the creation of the records (or longer if an enforcement proceeding is in eﬀect) and be kept at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the place of employment of workers in the H-1B program.

The other records listed above must be kept for one year beyond the end of the employment period speciﬁed on the LCA, and be

available at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the place of employment.

After the LCA is certiﬁed, if there is a strike or lockout of workers at the place of employment in the same occupational

classiﬁcation as the H-1B nonimmigrants, the employer must notify ETA within three days.

Aggrieved parties, and others, may ﬁle complaints with the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division alleging H-1B-related violations. When violations are found, the Administrator may assess civil money penalties, depending on the type and severity of

the violation. The Administrator may also impose other remedies, including payment of back wages.

Within 15 days of the date of the Administrator's determination, any interested party may request a hearing on the Wage and Hour

Administrator's determination before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Within 30 days of the decision by an ALJ, an interested party may request a review of the ALJ's decision by the Department's Administrative Review Board.
