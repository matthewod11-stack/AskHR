integration of the parts is just as important as the selection of the right

components. In our experience, personalization can be largely self-

funding, even in the initial years, when the right trade-oﬀs are made.

As the teams deliver concrete business value, larger investments can be

funded and the partnership between ﬁnance and a personalization team

becomes even more important to ensure that a portion of the gains are

regularly invested back into personalization eﬀorts.

Compete on speed. Ultimately, personalization depends on the speed

and scale of learning. Hence every organization should ask itself

how teams could rethink processes to learn 10 times as fast. Many

organizations are still working in eight- to 12-week campaign cycles.

Three to ﬁve days is possible in every industry. Even companies

that have cut their cycles down to days have a hard time taking the

learnings forward quickly and enhancing the next customer interaction.

Automation of speciﬁc areas (enhancing content, for example, or

adjusting targeting and data science) can give teams rapid optimization

tactics to improve KPIs meaningfully every week. On an annual basis,

measuring how far you have progressed on the Personalization Index is

a great way to hold the organization accountable.
