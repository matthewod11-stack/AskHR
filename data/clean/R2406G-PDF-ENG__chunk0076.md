## HBR / Magazine Article / Personalization Done Right

For several decades companies have been gradually improving

their ﬁnancial performance by tapping the range of capabilities

that can power personalization. We are now at a tipping point:

Brand-diﬀerentiating personalization is not only possible but will be

essential for competitive success. With the availability of new AI

tools, a company’s ability to embed personalization capabilities in its

operations has increased dramatically.

As the Personalization Index shows, there is a marked diﬀerence

between the leaders—who are reshaping their value propositions and

go-to-market approaches through personalization—and those who are

just using basic tech tools to bombard prospects with impersonal

messages. Tomorrow’s winners are already using AI to unlock

personalization’s potential, and they are building new sustainable

advantages along the way. The time for delivering growth with AI-

enabled personalization is now.
