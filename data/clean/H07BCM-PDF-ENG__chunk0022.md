## HBR / Digital Article / What’s Stopping You from Reinventing Your Career?

When we began to work with Sam, it was clear that as a scientist

he understood the language of experiments very well. So, our work

with him emphasized the need to conduct experiments in order to

make progress on the work of reinvention. We asked Sam to bring the

same level of curiosity to examining his life that he brought to his

experiments. We encouraged him to conduct experiments to identify

sources of fulﬁllment in life and at work. Within time, he realized that

there was no “formula” nor right answer, but many exciting options,

and the choice was his to make. He decided to stay in his role for the

next two years and to deliberately make time for some experiments to explore options. He set one professional experiment in place by oﬀering

support to a local start-up and one personal experiment to rekindle his

love of music by joining a choir.

If you tend to search for the “right” answer when evaluating choices,

this may be a sign that you might shy away from embarking on

experimentation or accepting mistakes as a pathway to learning and

growth. It can be useful to ask what alternate paths are there?
