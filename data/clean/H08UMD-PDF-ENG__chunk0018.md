## Rudeness at Work Silences Women More Than Men

Disrespectful behavior on the job—like shooting someone’s idea down

hastily or interrupting a colleague who’s speaking—might not be

malicious. But a new study found that it can have a major impact on

women’s willingness to speak up.

the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. They told the

participants they would each work for a few minutes with a group in

an online chatroom to come up with a creative name for a product.
