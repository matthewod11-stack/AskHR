## A Multilevel Framework for Work Team Diversity Research

in terms of diversity attributes and outcomes considered in research as well as the pattern of results reported. We also aim at identifying various aspects of the context that have been considered in research in this period. In the third section, we consider how the non-signiﬁcant, positive, negative, and curvilinear effects of diversity found in research to date can be explained by these contextual features. Finally, we consider the implications of these contextual considerations for future research on work team diversity.

WHAT IS THE CONTEXT OF DIVERSITY?

Several researchers acknowledge that contextual considerations are critical in diversity research (e.g., Jackson et al., 2003; Martins, Miliken, Wiesenfeld, & Salgado, 2003). However, a detailed description and conceptualization of diversity context has been less forthcoming. Recently, Johns (2006) offered a welcome and comprehensive framework for deﬁning the many facets of context in the study of organizational phenomena. In outlining a framework for the contextual antecedents of work team diversity, we draw on and extend this conceptualization of context (see Fig. 1). Broadly, drawing on Johns’ terminology, we consider two main dimensions of context – an omnibus diversity context and a discrete diversity context.
