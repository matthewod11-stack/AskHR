## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Poster. All covered employers are required to display and keep displayed the OSHA Job Safety and Health: It's the Law poster. Employers in states with an OSHA-approved state plan may be required to post a state

version of the OSHA poster. There is a separate poster for Federal agencies. The OSHA poster must be

displayed in a conspicuous place where employees can see it. Copies of the poster shall be at least 8 1/2 by

14 inches with 10 point type. The poster is available in English, Spanish, and several other languages. Posting

of the notice in languages other than English is not required, but OSHA encourages employers with workers that speak other languages to also display the other relevant versions of the poster.

Notices. Employees, former employees and their representatives have the right to review the OSHA Form

300, Log of Work-related Illnesses and Injuries, in its entirety. Employers are required to post the Summary of

Work-related Injuries and Illnesses (Form 300A) in a visible location so that employees are aware of the injuries

and illnesses that occur in their workplace. Employers are required to post the Summary Form (300A) by February 1 of the year following the year covered by the form and keep it posted until April 30 of that year.

OSHA-approved state plan states must adopt occupational injury and illness recording requirements that are

substantially identical to the Federal OSHA requirements. Since each state plan's requirements may diï¬€er slightly, the Federal OSHA requirements are described below.

Records for employers with 10 or fewer employees. Employers with 10 or fewer employees at all times

during the last calendar year do not need to keep OSHA injury and illness records unless OSHA or the Bureau

of Labor Statistics (BLS) informs them in writing that records must be kept. However, all employers covered by

the OSH Act must report to OSHA any workplace incident that results in a fatality, an amputation, the loss of an eye, or the in-patient hospitalization of one or more employees.
