Introduction According to the first principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, “Everyone has the right to quality and inclusive education, training and life-long learning in order to maintain and acquire skills that enable them to participate fully in society and successfully manage transitions in the labour market”. It also states that everyone has the right to timely and tailor-made assistance in order to improve employment or self-employment prospects. This includes the right to receive support for job searches, training and re-qualification

(EC, 2018). The competency approach can support the implementation of these conditions in life. This is why, in 2006, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the Recommendation on Key Competencies for Lifelong Learning. Since its adoption, the recommendation has been the main reference for the development of competency-based education, training and learning. However, due to the rapid change in the external environment, the requirements for competencies also change rapidly. The work is more computerised, automated and robotised. Technological development has a significant impact on the required skills and knowledge. It affects both the business environment and everyday life. Based on the above, in May 2018, the European Commission developed the Council Recommendation on Key Competencies for Lifelong Learning defining the core competencies that are necessary to improve performance, to sustain current standards of living, to adapt to market changes and to support high rates of employment (CEU, 2018). In general, people need a set of appropriate and most relevant competencies to meet the changing demands of the labour market and the required standards. The development of competency models facilitates the solution to this issue.

The purpose of this research is to define the basic concepts of actual competency models and to determine the advantages of their development. This research is a literature review for building a literature background for the next stage of the investigation, which will be empirical research.

- 1. Theoretical Framework The essence of competency will first be determined in order to understand the concept of competency models, the basic principles and the importance of their development as well as to define their advantages.

1.1 Concept of Competency In 1973, McClelland (1973) published the study Testing for Competency rather than for Intelligence in which personal competency (defined as motives and personality traits) or individual characteristics were recognised as significant predictors of employee performance and success. The researcher’s work was provocative because he claimed personal competencies to be a more important factor in predicting occupational success than traditional psychometrics, for instance, IQ and aptitude tests. McClelland (1973) is considered to be the founder of the competency theory in personnel management. Key competencies are often used to describe an organisation’s competitive advantages. Boyatzis (1982) defined competency as the underlying characteristic of a person that resulted in an effective and/or better work performance. In 1990, Prahalad and Hamel introduced the characteristics of key competencies of an organisation for the first time (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990).

The word ‘competency’ comes from the Latin word ‘competentia’, which can be

translated as ‘is authorised to judge’, respectively, ‘a person who has the right to speak’. Skorková (2016) summarised various interpretations of the competency concept as follows:

Competency as authority and responsibility. An employee has the right to take certain actions. Therefore, it refers to what was given to a person from the outside. Competency as a person’s ability to perform certain activities – quality, skills and the ability to do something competently.

There are several definitions of competencies. Mooney (2007) concluded that different competencies are skills, knowledge and abilities that are characteristic of being visible to customers and are better than those of their competitors and difficult to imitate. In a strategic implementation, these different competenc ies can lead to sustainable competitive advantages. Competencies can be defined as the mobilisation of knowledge, actions and emotions used to create value (Bendassolli et al., 2016). According to the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, compet ency includes a combination of knowledge, skills and behaviour that are practised for self-improvement (UNIDO, 2002). Likewise, Salleh et al. (2015) determined that comp etency is a set of skills, knowledge and behaviour that characterises a person‘s better performance in each particular aspect. Competencies exist due to personal values in life, attitude and internal motivation for the quality performance of tasks and the creation of excellent work. Competencies are not only knowledge and skills; they are related to the ability to perform complex tasks in specific circumstances (in a special context). Competencies are a proven ability to responsibly and autonomously use one’s knowledge, skills and abilities (personal, social and/or methodological) in different situations, for instance: work, study, professional and personal development (Chiru et al., 2012). This means that a competent person must be able to understand the circumstances and adapt to them depending on the situation.

According to the EU Council’s terminology, competency is
