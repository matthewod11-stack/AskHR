Temperature Another important issue concerning the working environment is the effect of temperature on employee stress, performance, and health. Many jobs such as those in construction and in the steel industry involve working in intense heat, and others such as rescue squad work and meatpacking often involve working in extreme cold.

Perhaps the best place to begin a discussion of the effects of temperature is by describing how the human body tries to maintain an ideal temperature. When body temperature is above normal, we cool down in one of two ways. The first is through radiation, with the excess heat radiating away from the body. The sec- ond way is by evaporation, or by sweating away excess heat.

When body temperature is below normal, blood vessels constrict. Although this process helps protect against cold, it also produces numbness by reducing circulation. That is why our feet and hands are the first parts of the body to feel numb when we are cold. Police officers working a beat can often be seen stomp- ing their feet in cold temperatures to stimulate circulation.

We must next understand how different factors affect what is called the effective temperature, or how hot or cold our environment feels to us. In theory, effective temperature has four components—air temperature, humidity, airflow, and temperature of objects in the environment—but it is usually computed by con- sidering only air temperature and humidity. Note that effective temperature is more than simple air temperature. A -degree day in the Nevada desert feels cooler than a -degree day in a Georgia swamp. As Table . shows, the higher the humidity, the warmer the air temperature feels, and thus the higher the effective temperature. Many jobs, such as those in the steel and construction industries, involve working in intense heat, which can affect employee performance and health.

In addition to humidity, airflow is also important. We all can probably recall the feeling of relief from a breeze coming off a lake or the ocean. The air
