# Ask better questions

When you seek your leader’s perspective, you may naturally ask high-

level questions like “Do you have any feedback?” or “What did you

think?” The intent here is good—you don’t want to steer their thoughts

or appear like you’re ﬁshing for compliments. But broad questions can

unintentionally lead to replies that are all over the board. For example,

you ask your manger, “How did my presentation go?” You’re hoping for

suggestions on your slides, but they start criticizing your posture, and

now you feel self-conscious.

Ask more speciﬁc questions to get more speciﬁc answers. For example,

“What’s one thing I could have done diﬀerently with how I shared the

market analysis?” or “How could I have addressed the CEO’s question

about the budget more accurately?” By narrowing down what you want

to know, you encourage your manager to drill into the areas you care
