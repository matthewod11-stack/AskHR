# HBR / Digital Article / Why Senior Leaders Should Stop Having So Many One-on-Ones

For example, the VP of engineering learned about a deprioritized

product feature from the VP of marketing. The VP of quality learned

about a new project to accelerate product delivery from the VP of

operations. The VP of sales learned about a new budget shift from the

CFO.

Melissa explained to me that, indeed, based on new information that

each of those executives had brought in their 1:1s, she supported their

recommended decisions, and assumed they would loop in the requisite

peers rather than waiting for the next monthly executive meeting. In

her mind, she was empowering her team to accelerate needed decisions

rather than being the bottleneck or playing messenger to the other VPs, thus slowing things down. Clearly her focus on eﬃciency blinded her

to the disunity and conﬂict it might provoke on the team. In each case,

she’d only gotten part of the story.

I gave her the advice I’ve given countless CEOs and C-suite leaders: Stop

having so many 1:1 meetings.
