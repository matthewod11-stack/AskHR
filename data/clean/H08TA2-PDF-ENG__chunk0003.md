A client of mine, Melissa, the CEO of a tech company in the healthcare

sector, vented to me about a conversation she’d had with her CHRO,

Ben. He came to her and said, “I’m hearing frustrations on the team

about how decisions are getting made.” Having prided herself on being

a transparent, inclusive leader (which she is), she was perplexed. Ben

went on to share several stories of team members who’d learned about

critical decisions that aﬀected them from their peers, not from Melissa.
