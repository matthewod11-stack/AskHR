increased perception of monetary worth among female employees (Barron, 2003). According to our results, male employees were likely to be more sensitive to pay inequity, whereas female employees were more sensitive to procedural justice. Since the current study demonstrated that when perceptions of procedural justice decrease among female employees, their organizational commitment drops rapidly, managers may need to emphasize how organizational changes may eventually improve organizational procedures to guarantee high organizational commitment of their female employees in particular. Thus, besides the obvious suggestion of eliminating the possible pay inequity between different employee groups, managers may want to involve a gender-balanced group in designing pay systems so that, especially female employees have a better access to knowledge about pay decisions and have an opportunity to see how a fair pay system is implemented.

A last implication is specifically directed to female employees. Female employees who are negotiating their salaries might need special training to ask for a higher salary than originally planned and to focus on the reasons they are entitled to this salary (Barron, 2003; Stuhlmacher and Walters, 1999). In addition, female employees should be aware of pay inequity and, thus, try their best not to avoid this in their own workplaces.
