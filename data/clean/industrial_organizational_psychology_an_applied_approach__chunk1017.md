Avoid sounding desperate and don’t beg (I really need a job bad! Please please please hire me!). Avoid grammar and spelling errors. Employers view cover letters and résumés as examples of the best work applicants can produce. If your cover letter contains errors, an employer will be concerned about the quality of your regular work. Avoid officious words or phrases. Don’t use a -cent word when a nickel word will do. Not only will employers be unimpressed by a large vocabulary, but applicants using “big words” often misuse them. As an example, one applicant tried to describe his work productivity by saying that his writings were “voluptuous,” rather than “voluminous,” as we think he meant to say. Don’t discuss personal circumstances such as “I find myself looking for a job because I am recently divorced.” Employers are interested in only your qualifications. If possible, tailor your letter to each company. Standard cover letters are efficient but not as effective as those written specifically for each job you are applying for. Don’t write your cover letter on the stationery of your current employer. Ensure that you have used the correct name of the organization throughout the letter. It is not uncommon when sending out large numbers of cover letters to change the company name in the address but forget to change it in the body of the letter.
