For 20 years, I’ve worked as a coach, helping leaders and teams

improve their presentation skills. One of the most frequent comments

I’ve gotten is, “Wow, this kind of feels like therapy!” This may sound

surprising to some, but my guidance typically delves deeper than the

popular advice, like make eye contact, use body language, or share your

agenda beforehand. While my approach is by no means therapy, I do

push people to improve by engaging in some inner work.
