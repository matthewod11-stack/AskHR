# development programs?

JASON BUECHEL:

One of the things I’m really, really proud of is the investment we put into

our team member experience and focus around internal growth and

development. We had over 11,000 promotions over the last 12 months,

which I’m so proud of.

For example, when I look at my executive team, two of my direct

reports actually started in our stores part-time. Our head of operations,

Bill Jordan, as an example, joined through Mrs. Gooch’s [Natural Food

Markets], which was one of our acquisitions. He’s worked across almost

every part of our stores, multiple regions, and now leads operations

reporting directly to me for all of Whole Foods Market.

We’re making big investments into career development programs. We

do this for our major leadership positions within the organization. Just

yesterday, I was actually doing the keynote graduation ceremony for our

store team leader career development program which is focused on a

six-month period, helping make sure our team members are ready to

take that next step up.
