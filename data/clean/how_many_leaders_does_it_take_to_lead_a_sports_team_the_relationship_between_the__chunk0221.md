## Athlete Leadership and Team Effectiveness

carried out with college or university athletes [8, 20] or competitive athletes from lower com- petition levels [19] in a variety of team sports. Within the present elite sporting context, exter- nal leaders may be more prominent, as more contact with media and sponsors is needed at this level. We can conclude that most teams show a structure of shared leadership across the different leadership roles, with each role being occupied by at least one player. Only with respect to external leadership, teams also showed shared leadership within this leadership role. Further research in different age groups or competition levels is necessary to test the generaliz- ability of our findings.
