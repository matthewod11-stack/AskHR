This is why for budgets I often recommend zero-based budgeting, which

forces ﬁrms to evaluate costs with a fresh eye. As part of a zero-based

budget process, the ﬁrm has to clear away from previous budgets and

justify all recurring expenses anew. This process forces businesses to

leave their anchors behind and thus ﬁnd new opportunities for savings

and growth. This is particularly relevant with current supply chain
