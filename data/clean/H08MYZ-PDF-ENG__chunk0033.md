# interviews with a human.

Note that, when you’re invited to record answers for a pre-screen

interview, many companies will provide up to three minutes to answer

the question. Recruiters I spoke with while researching my most recent

book recommend using no more than two minutes to answer a question,

because at all levels, you’re expected to know how to synthesize

information into concise, clear answers using applicable keywords

aligned with the roles and responsibilities in the job description.

Overtalking won’t increase your chances of passing the screen.

Ask about AI progress.

Because the tech landscape continues to change rapidly, once you get

the opportunity to interview with a human, you’ll want to get a sense of

whether and how the company is using AI. For example, you might ask,

“How is the company and this speciﬁc function innovating with AI and

automation?” and “What kinds of upskilling and reskilling programs

does the company oﬀer for those whose jobs will be made obsolete by

AI?”

Understanding an organization’s progress in AI implementation can

give you insight into what your long-term success might look like

there. Why? Because McKinsey & Company is reporting that AI could

automate up to 70% of business activities by 2030, and Goldman Sachs

says 300 million jobs could be displaced. If you determine that you’re

applying to a company already implementing AI, you may have less fear
