aspects and criticizes the construct multidimensionality, highlighting that the dimensions or particular aspects of the job are innumerous, varying according to the situations, then, making difficult theoretical formulations and elaborations about the concept (Yucel, 2012). In this study, the multidimensional vision was adopted, intending to relate each aspect of the construct with the turnover intent, as well as its intensity. An instrument composed in sub-scales, referent to specific aspects of the job related to satisfaction, elaborated by Siqueira (2008), was used in this research. As per Siqueira (2008), investigating job satisfaction means evaluating how much the offered returns by the enterprise in salaries and promotions satisfy the individual, how much convenient he/she is with the colleagues and the bosses, and how much the tasks given to the employee makes him/her glad and gives a feeling of pleasure. In the sequence, the possible relations will be approached between organizational commitment and turnover intention.

2.4 Organizational commitment, job satisfaction and turnover intention Organizational commitment and job satisfaction are invariably found as turnover intention background (Iverson, 1999; Du et al., 2006; Ferreira and Siqueira, 2005; Rouse, 2001; Baotham et al., 2010). Tett and Meyer (1993), through a meta-analysis with 155 papers, suggested that these constructs contribute independently in turnover intention, affirming that in last decades research works that developed voluntary turnover models considered these two concepts as background. Chang et al.’s (2013) study seeks to identify the factors which influence the decisions of the worker to leave or stay in the organization, identify in job satisfaction and the commitment as the most common.

According to Carayon et al. (2006), studies conducted on IT professionals have identified the turnover intention as a result of organizational commitment and job satisfaction. They affirm that turnover intention is strongly influenced by these two constructs, still highlighting the impact of other demographic variables as career experience (Bastos, 1993). In their studies, Allen and Meyer (1990) still added that in all three approaches of organizational commitment (affective, normative or institutional), the commitment is understood as a negative indicator of turnover, because it decreases its possibility. One of the greatest preoccupations of the organizations is to keep their employees motivated, in (Paula and Mendonça, 2014). order The consequences of job satisfaction were also explored in the literature. The results demonstrated that the affective bond of the employee with the dimensions of job satisfaction may generate positive results to the organization. Siqueira and Gomide Junior (2004) affirmed that persons with the highest levels of contentment with the job are also the ones

to obtain good organizational commitment
