factor structure, magnitude of factor loadings, measurement scale, and residual invar- iance (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002). MI progresses stepwise through four increasingly stringent levels: configural, metric (weak), scalar (strong), and residual (strict) (Pousa et al., 2018). MI is established when the chi-squared difference between each progres- sively constrained model is non-significant (p > .05) and the model fit indices remain stable (Hammack-Brown et al., 2024). MI testing is common in workplace coaching research. For example, Pousa et al. (2018) conducted MI testing when exploring whether managerial coaching’s impact on performance was stronger for females compared with males. Since our goal was to compare the latent means of work-related outcomes across two groups, achieving MI to the scalar level was a necessary precondition (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002; Müller & Schäfer, 2017).

Following Hammack-Brown et al. (2024) and Pousa et al. (2018), we conducted a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA). We first tested configural invar- iance (no model constraints), then metric (weak) invariance, where factor loadings were constrained to be equal across groups, and finally scalar (strong) invariance, where both factor loadings and intercepts were constrained to be equal across groups. The chi- squared difference test between progressively constrained models was non-significant (p > .05) at both metric and scalar levels, with model fit indices remaining acceptable and stable. As per Table 1, for the matched sample, MI was achieved to the scalar (strong) level.

Having met the requirement for comparing latent means (i.e. MI to the scalar level) (Tsaousis & Alghamdi, 2022), we proceeded to test our hypotheses by comparing latent mean difference between the coached and no-coach groups.
