## demand words and actions from leaders on the political causes they

care most about, trying to avoid the conversation — or oﬀering little

more than a cagey “I see the merits of both sides” or “I really can’t say

what I think” — is likely to provoke distrust and animosity.

Whether you are leading an organization, conducting a meeting, or

having dinner with friends, political topics are bound to come up.

The urge to avoid these hot-button issues is natural, but our research

demonstrates that trying not to take sides can backﬁre, causing you

to seem less trustworthy and pushing people to assume you secretly

disagree with them. In an increasingly polarized workplace and world,

building trust hinges on ﬁnding ways to discuss our beliefs and values,

even (and especially) with people who disagree. So if someone asks for

your opinion, be considerate, thoughtful, and respectful — but don’t be

afraid to take a side.
