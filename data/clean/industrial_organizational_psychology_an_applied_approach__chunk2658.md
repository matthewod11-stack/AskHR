## Problem Area : Intended Message Versus Message Sent

For effective communication, the sender must know what she wants to say and how she wants to say it. Interpersonal communication problems can occur when the message a person sends is not the message she intended. There are three solutions to this problem: thinking about what you want to communicate, practicing what you want to communicate, and learning better communication skills.

Thinking about What You Want to Communicate Often the reason we don’t say what we mean is that we are not really sure what we want to say. For example, think of using the drive-thru window at a fast-food restaurant. As soon as you stop, but before you have a chance to read the menu board, a voice crackles, “Can I take your order?” You intelligently reply something like, “Uhhhhhhh, could you hang on a minute?” and then quickly try to place an order as the pressure builds. As you drive off, you realize that you did not really order what you wanted.

Does this scenario sound familiar? If so, you are not alone. Foster and his colleagues () found that many fast-food restaurant customers have so little time to think about their order that they make ordering mistakes. They found that placing a menu sign before the ordering station gave customers more time to think about their orders and that this decreased average ordering times from  seconds to  seconds and ordering errors from % to %.

As another example, think about calling a friend and unexpectedly getting an answering machine. Have you ever left a message in which the first few sen- tences sounded reasonably intelligent? Did the first sentence again begin with “Uhhhhhhhhh”? Or have you ever made a call expecting to get an answering machine and instead had an actual person answer the phone? These examples show the importance of thinking about what you want to communicate.

Practice What You Want to Communicate Even though you may know what you want to say, communication errors can occur if you do not actually say what you meant to say. Thus, when communica- tion is important, it should be practiced. Just as consultants practice before giving a training talk and actors rehearse before a performance, you too need to prac- tice what you want to say in important situations. Perhaps you can remember

practicing how you were going to ask a person out on a date: changing the tone of your voice, altering your first line, or thinking of topics to discuss so that you would appear spontaneous.

Learn Better Communication Skills Even if you know what you want to say and how you want to say it, communica- tion errors can still occur if you do not have the proper communication skills. It is essential to take courses in public speaking, writing, and interpersonal communi- cation so that you will be better prepared to communicate effectively. Because of the importance of communication skills, many organizations offer a wide range of communication training programs for their employees.
