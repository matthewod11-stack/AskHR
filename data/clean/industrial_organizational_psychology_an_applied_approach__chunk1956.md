# Evaluation Criteria

In the previous section, we discussed research designs for evaluating training. In each design, a pretest and posttest were included. This section will discuss the types of criteria that can be used for these pretests and posttests. There are six levels at which training effectiveness can be measured: content validity, employee reactions, employee learning, application of training, business impact, and return on investment (Phillips & Stone, ).

Content Validity At times, the only way that training can be evaluated is by comparing training content with the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform a job. In other words, the content validity of the training can be examined. For example, if a job analysis indicates that knowledge of electronic circuitry is necessary to per- form a job, then a seminar that is designed to teach this knowledge would have content validity. Although content analysis may ensure that a training program is job related, it still does not indicate whether a particular training method is effec- tive. But if a training program is content valid and is conducted by a professional trainer who can document previous success with the method in other organiza- tions, it may be a safe assumption that the training program will be successful. Keep in mind, however, that making such an assumption is acceptable only when actually evaluating the effect of training is not possible because there are too few employees for a proper analysis or there are financial or political constraints on conducting a proper evaluation.

Employee Reactions The most commonly used method to evaluate training is measuring employee reactions to the training (Sitzmann, Brown, Casper, Ely, & Zimmerman, ). Employee reactions involve asking employees if they enjoyed the training and learned from the training. These ratings tend to be most influenced by the trainer’s style and the degree of interaction in the training program, but are also influenced by the motivation of the trainee prior to training as well as perceptions of organizational support for the training (Sitzmann et al., ). Employee reactions are important because employees will not have confidence in the training and will not be motivated to use it if they do not like the training process. However, even though positive employee reactions are necessary for training to be successful, positive employee reactions do not mean that training will lead to changes in knowledge or performance (Pfau & Kay, b).

Because trainee reactions constitute the lowest level of training evaluation, they can often be misleading. For example, most seminars conducted by outside consultants are informative and well presented, so employee reactions are almost
