# **Explanation:**

- 1. **Lack of urgency:** The email does not convey any sense of urgency or

time-sensitivity. It sta(cid:457)s with a casual greeting and presents the information in a ma(cid:459)er-of-fact tone.

- 2. **Non-critical bug repo(cid:457):** The bug repo(cid:457)ed in the contact form is

described as interesting but not critical. The email sender even suggests that the website owner can leave the bug in place.

- 3. **Lack of personal impact:** The email does not indicate any direct or

personal impact on the website owner. It simply mentions that the sender enjoys reading the website.
