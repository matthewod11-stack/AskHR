Appeal review procedure: If the written Notice of Contest has been Ô¨Åled within 15 working days, the OSHA

Area Director forwards the case to the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC). The

Commission is an independent agency not associated with OSHA or the Department of Labor. The

Commission assigns the case to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The ALJ may disallow the contest if it is

found to be legally invalid, or a hearing may be scheduled for a public place near the employer's workplace. The employer and the employees have the right to participate in the hearing; the OSHRC does not require that

they be represented by attorneys.

Once the ALJ has ruled, any party to the case may request a further review by OSHRC. Also, any of the three

OSHRC commissioners may individually move to bring a case before the Commission for review. Commission

rulings may be appealed to the U.S. Courts of Appeals.

Appeals in state plan states: States with their own occupational safety and health programs have their own

The OSH Act covers all private sector working conditions that are not addressed by safety and health

regulations of another Federal agency under other legislation. OSHA also has the authority to monitor the

safety and health of Federal employees. Federal agency heads are responsible for the safety and health of

Federal employees. The OSHA-approved state plan states extend their coverage to state and local
