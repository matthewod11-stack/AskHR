# National Psychological Associations 549

established by the APA in 1995, the ABPP established the policy of referring all new specialties to the APA for ﬁrst consideration.

The National Register of Health Care Providers in Psychology quickly became a signiﬁcant component of pro- fessional psychology, as noted above. The ﬁrst National Reg- ister listed 7,000 psychologists in 1975; by 2000 the list had grown to more than 16,000 psychologists. The National Reg- ister was successful in providing a deﬁnition of the psychol- ogist as a health service provider and in gaining acceptance across North American for the deﬁnition. In 1976, the NR was innovative in naming public members to its board of di- rectors, being the ﬁrst national psychology organization to do so. The National Register developed predoctoral internship criteria in 1980 and required that any psychologist who wished to be listed in its directory must have completed such an internship. These criteria were later adopted by the APPIC as the criteria for membership. The National Register also worked with the Association of State and Provincial Psy- chology Boards (ASPPB) to establish criteria for doctoral programs in psychology for the purpose of licensure of psy- chologists after the doctoral degree.

The Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) was founded in 1961 as the American As- sociation of State Psychology Boards. In addition to its work with the National Register and with other accrediting and cre- dentialing organizations, the ASPPB developed the national examination in professional psychology (Carlson, 1978). It worked over the remainder of the twentieth century on licen- sure reciprocity between the states, continuing-education standards, and other professional issues. The ASPPB adopted the APPIC internship criteria as the basic standard for deter- mining whether an applicant for licensure met the require- ment for a predoctoral internship.
