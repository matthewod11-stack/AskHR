## Predicting Performance Using References and Letters of Recommendation

In psychology, a common belief is that the best predictor of future performance is past performance. Thus, if an organization wants to hire a salesperson, the best applicant might be a successful salesperson who held jobs which were similar to the one for which he is now applying.

Verifying previous employment is not difficult, but it can be difficult to ver- ify the quality of previous performance. I recently watched the National Football League’s draft of college players on television (ESPN, of course) and was envious of the fact that professional football teams can assess a player’s previous perfor- mance by watching game films. That is, they do not have to rely on the opinions of other coaches. Instead, the scouts can watch literally every minute a player has spent on the field while in college.

Unfortunately, few applicants bring “game films” of their previous employ- ment performances. Instead, an employer must obtain information about the quality of previous performance by relying on an applicant’s references, either by calling those references directly or asking for letters of recommendation from previous employers. The Career Workshop box tells how to ask for a letter of recommendation.

Before discussing this topic further, it might be a good idea to differentiate among reference checks, references, and letters of recommendation. A reference check is the process of confirming the accuracy of information provided by an applicant. A reference is the expression of an opinion, either orally or through a written checklist, regarding an applicant’s ability, previous performance, work habits, character, or potential for future success. The content and format of a reference are determined by the person or organization asking for the refer- ence. A letter of recommendation is a letter expressing an opinion regarding an applicant’s ability, previous performance, work habits, character, or potential for future success. The content and format of a letter of recommendation are deter- mined by the letter writer.
