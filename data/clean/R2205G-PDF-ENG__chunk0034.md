# WORK/LIFE BALANCE

As the pandemic has waned, some employers have added more ﬂexible-work options, but if they continue to send the message that people who use those options will pay a price, we may see a return to the bad old days.

Flextime boosts performance. Companies worry about the costs of implementing ﬂextime. But not those that have done the math. Among them is the Gap, which in 2015 ran an experiment to ﬁgure out how much it would cost to make employees’ schedules more predictable and ﬂexible. To help with predictability the chain ended on-call shifts and began providing work schedules two weeks in advance; to increase ﬂexibility it oﬀered electronic shift-swapping. The company asked managers to schedule consistent start and ﬁnish times whenever possible, add hours for part-timers who wanted them, and increase peak-hours staﬃng.

The results were eye-opening. After nine months workers reported that they were better able to deal with work/life challenges. Supervisors found the changes to be manageable and said that they had improved associates’ morale and productivity. Best of all, instead of costing the chain money, the changes increased sales by 7% and labor productivity by 5%.

we can see that the impact is striking, even after taking into account other changes in the ﬁrms, the labor market, and the economy: The representation of white women and nonwhite workers in management increases. (We examined eﬀects on the eight groups large enough to run statistical models on.) Not surprisingly, as the share of women and people of color goes up, the share of white men goes down. (See the exhibit “How Work/Life Beneﬁts Aﬀect Organizational Diversity.”)
