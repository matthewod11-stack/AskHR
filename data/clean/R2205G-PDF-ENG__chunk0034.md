Since 1993 U.S. federal law has required companies with 50 or more employees to give eligible workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or an ailing family member or deal with a medical problem of their own. But not all employers obey the law. Today one in 14 doesn’t oﬀer the required 12 weeks to new mothers, and nearly one in four doesn’t oﬀer them to new fathers.
