# Permission to Pause

Many organizations we’ve worked with seem pathologically busy, driven

by the need to achieve more with less and meet immediate targets while

discounting the longer game of creating sustainable value. A recurring

theme in our research is leaders’ wish for “permission to pause” so that

they can respond thoughtfully to issues and pay attention to the world

more broadly, rather than ﬁxating on the immediate task and “moving

fast.”

With this in mind, we asked leaders what advice they’d oﬀer, in

hindsight, about responding well to employee activists. From their

answers, we drew out four recommendations:

Notice your “baggage” about activists and activism. Activism is

becoming ever more controversial, and leaders often react without

appreciating their own and their organization’s biases, assumptions,

and emotions about the issue and the employees raising it.

Accept that you almost certainly don’t know how your employees

feel about some issues. That’s because you aren’t as available or as

approachable as you think. Every leader has a “power shadow,” which

means that they’re told only what others believe they can bear to hear.
