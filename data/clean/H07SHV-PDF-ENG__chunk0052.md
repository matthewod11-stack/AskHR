# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

work-life balance? You can work on yourself, but as you said, misery and

all this stuﬀ is contagious. How can you move the needle on leadership

that doesn’t appreciate any of this?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

When it comes to leadership, leader lead thyself. Your number one

employee is you. Don’t be the pace-setting leader.

Remember when Daniel Goleman wrote that famous book Leadership

actually horrible—is workaholic pace-setting leaders that are in the oﬃce all the time and saying, “Look, if I’m going to ask people to work

hard, I have to work even harder.” It’s incredibly dispiriting for other

people. It lowers their quality of life.

When I was a CEO, I’m telling you, somebody on my executive team

says, “Arthur, you got to stop sending email at 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM

because people are going to stay up wondering if they’re going to have to

answer your email.” I said, “I don’t expect anybody to…” That’s not the

point. So I put timers on my email to do that.

But even better was when my wife started clamping down and saying,

“You need to sleep more. You need to go to the gym more. You need

to have more of a life.” So number one, if you’re a leader, you need to

get a hold on this problem because you’re going to be hurting yourself,

wrecking your relationships, and disheartening all the people around

you. This is a big problem.

Second, don’t work for a workaholic. Don’t work for them if you can.

And again, not everybody’s got all these degrees of freedom, but most
