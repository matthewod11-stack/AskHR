### **[2. From predictable pathways to perpetual adaptation]{.underline}**

[Remember when you could predict what skills would matter in a
decade?]{.underline}

[Exponential change has killed predictability. AI capabilities are
doubling while human development remains linear. The skills you\'re
building today might be obsolete before you master them. The strategy
you\'re implementing might be irrelevant before it\'s complete. The
future isn\'t just uncertain---it\'s fundamentally
unknowable.]{.underline}

[This demands a new kind of leadership: one that thrives on
discontinuity rather than stability. Leaders must now build resilience
when disruption is the norm, create stability through values rather than
processes, focus on building skills with a long 'half life', and embrace
\"strong opinions, loosely held\" as an operating
philosophy.]{.underline}

[The paradox? You must move faster while being more thoughtful. Act
decisively while staying adaptable. Commit fully while being ready to
pivot instantly.]{.underline}
