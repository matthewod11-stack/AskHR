member put it bluntly: “It felt like we were being handed self-care

instructions while the house was still on ﬁre.”

This wasn’t an isolated case. Across the organizations we studied,

57% of employees said they felt worse after culture-enhancing

perks were introduced. The most common reason? It reinforced a

sense that leadership was either unaware of deeper problems — or

unwilling to confront them. Instead of addressing low psychological

safety, inconsistent management, or chronic overload, companies were

oﬀering a smoothie bar.

By contrast, organizations that removed surface-level perks and

reinvested in structural improvements—such as manager coaching,

conﬂict resolution, and clearer work boundaries—saw real gains.

Burnout scores dropped by 22%, and perceptions of fairness and

leadership care increased signiﬁcantly.

The lesson: culture doesn’t improve by giving people more. It improves

when you remove the things that waste their time, drain their energy, or

blur their priorities. Perks are not culture. Operating norms are.
