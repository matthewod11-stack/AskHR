# back to burnout.

But that anxiety tends to push us toward a retreat to our individual

corner, and people start to think, “Am I going to be OK?” They become

more focused on their own wellbeing than on the health of the team

or health of the organization. And that gives rise to a real potential for

erosion, even vicious cycles, where organizations ﬁnd themselves in the

trap of responding to requests and issues in isolation, one by one.

We need a more holistic way of thinking about it. And I see limited

evidence of companies being at least described as pausing to think

about the larger picture, their value proposition, what it implies for how

they must be structured and led, to get the necessary work done, and

how to organize that work, with all its variety and variable needs, in a

thoughtful way, and how to inspire and motivate people to do it well.

Let me just brieﬂy go to the burnout issue, because there actually has

been some recent data, some studies that have caught my eye, showing

that burnout is systematically higher when psychological safety is

lower, right? For instance, it seems to me that some portion of the

burnout is associated with loneliness and isolation. I think it’s fair to say

that we can endure many challenges when we feel genuinely that we’re

in it together, that we’re connected and engaged with our colleagues in

trying to sort of navigate these challenges.
