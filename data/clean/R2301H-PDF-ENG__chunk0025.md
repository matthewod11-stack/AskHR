## your team, such as a shift from a major cost-transformation eﬀort

toward a growth strategy. First, Lean In and come up with a list of

options for how you might best get people on board. When you think

you are ﬁnished, Lean Back and be even more objective. Ask yourself,

“What else would align the team?” Then Lean With by consulting others

about what they think the options are for you to create a trusting and

positive climate in which the change will be best received. And then

Don’t Lean and see if anything else pops into your mind. Put the issue

on the back burner for a moment and let your subconscious go to work.

Look for signs that it’s time to pivot. To create the impact you want,

you need to be aware of any negative eﬀects that a given stance is

having on the people around you. This will be your signal that it’s

time to adopt a new one. If Lean In is your default (as it is for many

leaders), recognize that doing so too often—or too hard—can shut

others down, especially when you are in a position of authority. In

meetings, pay attention to how much you’re speaking compared with

others. Automated transcription software can provide data showing

whether your voice is (or is not) the dominant one in the room. Most

leaders are surprised by how much they need to switch to Leaning Back

or Leaning With. Focus on listening with the goal of understanding.

Consciously catch yourself not only when you’re jumping into the

conversation but also when you stop listening carefully and start

thinking about your response. After someone has ﬁnished speaking,

take three breaths before you reply.
