# red-tinted sauce.

My faulty reasoning is the product of anchoring, a cognitive bias

that can undermine our critical thinking. According to researchers,

anchoring is when people rely on irrelevant but easily accessible facts to

make judgments. Our minds give too much weight to initial impressions

or numbers that inﬂuence — our subsequent thoughts. In my case, the

prices on the adult menu shaped — or anchored — my judgment about

the value of the items on the children’s menu.
