## Theory of the Evolution of the Brain and Psychopathology

J. Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911), an English neurologist who specialized in neuropathology, conﬁrmed Broca’s dis- covery of the speech center, ﬁnding in most cases that aphasia in right-handed persons is associated with disease of the left cerebral hemisphere. In 1863, he observed epileptic convul- sions that progress through the body in a series of spasms; such convulsions are now known as “Jacksonian epilepsy.” He theorized that the lower functional levels of the human in all mind are dynamically and unconsciously present healthy individuals and are temporarily released from control of the higher cortical centers whenever the cortex is relatively inactive, as during sleep, and in cases of cortical damage. Jackson concluded that the behavioral symptoms of brain damage are determined by the functioning of one or more lower centers that have been freed from the inhibitory control normally imposed on them by the higher brain centers. He pointedoutthatthisevolutionarysequencecanbeobservedin individual mental development and suggested that in old age, in various neurological diseases, and in most forms of in- sanity there occurs a general reversal of this developmental/ evolutionary process (Jackson, 1887).
