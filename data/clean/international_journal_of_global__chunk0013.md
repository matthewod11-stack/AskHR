# 2.2.5. Internal Vs External Successor

The selection of internally or externally successor is another major concern. Some organizations find it more rewarding to promote internal successor, while other organizations prefer to recruit externals. Organizations face problems when the technical and specialized positions become vacant. Hiring an internal employee for critical positions is an advantage for institutions that encourage public service employees to work harder for a promotion. Internal hiring will make the process simple and fast for unforeseen circumstances such as sudden contract termination, death or disability of senior management staff.

On the other hand, hiring an external candidate can slow the process and lead to conflict among the existing senior staff. It is also costly and according to Bano (2017), 65% of external hiring fail within the first two years. Moreover, external recruitment consumes a lot of time and is costly (example; hidden expenses). Since some organizations (example; higher education institutions) has specialized and technical vacant positions. This kind of planning may allow public institutions to identify talent within the organization. Some organizations find it more rewarding to promote a successor from within, but some organizations prefer externally. Some experts believe that all successors from within is dangerous, since this practice tends to limit internal management style.
