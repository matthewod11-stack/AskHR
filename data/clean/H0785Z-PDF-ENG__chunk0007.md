## HBR / The Big Idea / What Defines a Successful Organization?

consistency, and predictability were top concerns; core competencies

were cherished foundations to build on; and leaders viewed the world

from inside the organization looking out.

To thrive today, however, companies must be able to detect external

changes from the outside in and have a built-in ﬂuidity so they can

continually adapt. They need to focus on individual customers, make

their core competencies dynamic, and rely on teams instead of a

hierarchy — all by using the power of data and algorithms.

As we look back on a century of Harvard Business Review, we should

also take time to look ahead — and recognize what the next iteration of

a successful organization looks like.
