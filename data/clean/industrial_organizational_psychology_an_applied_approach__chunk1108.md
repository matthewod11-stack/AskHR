Knowledge of the Applicant. A second problem with letters of recommendation is that the person writing the letter often does not know the applicant well, has not observed all aspects of an applicant’s behavior, or both. Professors are often asked to provide recommendations for students whom they know only from one or two classes. Such recommendations are not likely to be as accurate and complete as those provided by professors who have had students in several classes and per- haps worked with them outside the classroom setting.

Even in a work setting in which a supervisor provides the recommendation, he often does not see all aspects of an employee’s behavior (Figure .). Employees often act very differently around their supervisors than they do around cowork- ers and customers. Furthermore, as Figure . shows and as will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter , those behaviors that a reference writer actually recalls are only a fraction of the behaviors actually occurring in the presence of the person writing the recommendation.

Reliability. The third problem with references and letters of recommendation involves the lack of agreement between two people who provide references for the same person. Research reveals that reference reliability is only . (Aamodt & Williams, ). The problem with reliability is so severe that there is more agreement between recommendations written by the same person for two different applicants than between two people writing recommendations for the same person (Aamodt & Williams, ). Thus, letters of recommendation may say more about the person writing the letter than about the person for whom it is being written.
