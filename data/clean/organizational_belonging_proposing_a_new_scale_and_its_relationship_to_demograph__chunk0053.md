# Initial survey sample

Comparing two initial survey samples before combining Survey participants from the technology consulting company (N¼130) and accounting firm (N¼30) were compared on demographic, organizational and outcomes variables prior to combining. Results showed that partici- pants were very similar on race (primarily White); religion (primarily Christian); political scale (M of 3.37 versus 3.34); age (M of 2.91 versus 3.06); organization tenure (M of 2.38 versus 2.26); productivity (M of 5.33 versus 5.37) and intent to stay (M of 5.38 versus 5.42). There was also a similar breakdown in position level/role. There was a notable difference in gender; Company A participants were primarily male (56%) and Company B participants were primarily female (70%). Overall, the similarities allowed these samples to be combined, into Table 1.
