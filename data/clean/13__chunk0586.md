## Cognitive, Affective, and Cultural Inﬂuences on Stigmatization

viewed as being less competent, less able to compete in society, and less likely to adapt to environmental changes (e.g., Goldberg & Shore, 2003; Shore & Goldberg, 2005). In addition, consistent with these stereotype- based views, research shows that older workers in the U.S. typically receive lower job suitability ratings than younger workers (Cleveland & Landy, 1981, 1983). Interestingly, however, age is not a basis for stigmatization in many other cultures. One reason for this is that many Western religions emphasize that life is brief and ﬁnite, and this view leads individuals to fear the end of life and to view signs of age negatively. In contrast, many Eastern and Native American cultures view life as a cyclical, ongoing process that involves birth, death, and rebirth (Smith, 1994). As a result, people in many Asian and Native American cultures are taught to revere and respect their elders, regarding them as having great wisdom that can beneﬁt their progeny.
