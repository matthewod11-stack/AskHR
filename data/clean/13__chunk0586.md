# (c) Illness.

Research reveals that there are cross-cultural differences in reactions to individuals with several types of illnesses (e.g., DeAngelo, 2000; Neutra et al., 1977; Saetermoe, Scattone, & Kim, 2001). For example, in the U.S. people with epilepsy are typically stigmatized by Anglo- Americans because their behavior is thought to be unpredictable (Stone et al., 1992). However, research by Neutra et al. (1977) found that among Navajos, hand trembling was regarded as a sign of shamanistic proclivity. As a result, it carried a positive connotation.
