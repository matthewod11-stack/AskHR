## paper cow, the meeting cow, and the speed cow.

The Paper Cow Paper cows are unnecessary paperwork—usually forms and reports that cost organizations money to prepare, distribute, and read. To determine if something is a paper cow, consider the extent to which the paperwork increases efficiency, productivity, or quality. Ask if anyone actually reads the paperwork. A unique strategy tried by employees at one company was to stop sending a monthly report that had been distributed for years. The employees’ thinking was that if the report was actually needed, they would receive complaints. Three months and three missing reports later, no one had complained.

A good annual practice is to review all forms and reports and determine whether they are still needed and, if they are, whether they are needed in their current format. To demonstrate the importance of this practice, review the forms used by your university or organization. How many of them are a third of a page or a quarter of a page? Probably none. There seems to be an unwritten rule that all forms must ask questions until the bottom of the page is reached. I was recently preparing contracts for our graduate assistants and noticed that I was being asked questions about the university from which the students had received their undergraduate degrees, their undergraduate grade point average, and their work histories. Note that these were contracts, not application forms, where this infor- mation was already contained. So, in the spirit of a good sacred cow hunt, I called the graduate college to ask why this information was necessary. Their reply? No one knew. Did anyone actually need this information? No. Will you change the form for next year? No. This is an example of a sacred cow hunt—but no sacred cow barbe- cue. To apply what you have learned about paper cow hunts, complete Exercise . in your workbook.

The Meeting Cow Another area ripe for change is the number and length of meetings. Think about meetings you have attended recently. How much meeting time was spent doing business as opposed to socializing? Was the meeting really necessary? To reduce the number and length of meetings, some organizations ask the person calling the meeting to determine the cost of the meeting (e.g., one hour’s salary of each attendee, cost of meeting room, cost of refreshments and supplies) and consider whether the cost will exceed the potential benefits. In some of these organiza- tions, the meeting costs are actually posted at the beginning of the meeting! Needless to say, when people are forced to consider the benefits of most meetings against their cost, most meetings will not be held.

The Speed Cow Unnecessary deadlines are another source for potential change. Requiring work to be done “by tomorrow” is sometimes necessary. However, unnecessary deadlines cause employees to work at a faster than optimal pace, resulting in decreased quality, increased stress, and increased health problems.

Kriegel and Brandt () suggest that in addition to sacred cow hunts,

effective change can be encouraged by using these strategies:

Think like a beginner: Ask stupid questions, constantly ask “why” things are being done a certain way, and don’t assume that anything makes sense. Don’t be complacent with something that is working well. Keep looking for ways to improve, new markets to enter, new products to introduce. Don’t play by everyone else’s rules; make your own. Domino’s Pizza is a great example of this type of thinking. While all the other pizza chains competed for ways to increase the number of customers entering their restaurants, Domino’s decided to change the rules and bring the restaurant to the people rather than bringing the people to the restaurant. Rather than penalizing mistakes, reward employees for making the attempt to change or to try something new.
