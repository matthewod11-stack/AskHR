# HBR / Digital Article / Building Cross-Cultural Relationships in a Global Workplace

Instead, they are meant to help professionals who work with colleagues

from diﬀerent cultures understand their own relationship “code,”

develop a sense of others’ styles, and (crucially) anticipate and identify

key gaps and overlaps between the two. With this newfound clarity,

the next step is to ﬁnd ways to bridge those gaps — or at least work

around them — so that otherwise promising relationships don’t fail to

launch. At the end of the day, people will make their own personal

determination about the extent to which they will adapt to the other’s

code, or simply accept the diﬀerence. But understanding the diﬀerence

is a critical ﬁrst step in building the relationship.
