# schedule.

Why? Consistent routines add structure to our days, boosting our

sense of control. Our brains get accustomed to performing sequences

of behaviors and eventually start to do these almost on autopilot. A

common example of how behaviors become automatic: Within a few

months of learning to drive, we all turn on our car, put on our seat belt,

release the brake, then look in our mirrors — without really thinking

about it. The same thing will happen with your productivity habits if

you’re consistent with when and where you do your job. If you do deep,

focused work during the same slot in your day, like 10 AM to noon,

keeping up that habit will become easier and more automatic over time,

even on days when you’re not at your best.
