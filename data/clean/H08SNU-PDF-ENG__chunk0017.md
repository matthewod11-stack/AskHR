## Substitution: Replace complex elements with simpler alternatives

This involves swapping out complicated components, processes, or

systems with simpler alternatives that serve the same core function

more elegantly. An example is Rwanda’s national health service, which

replaced unreliable mountain-road couriers with U.S.-based drone

startup Zipline’s battery-powered drones in 2016 to address blood-

delivery issues in rural areas. A 2022 study in The Lancet Global

Health reported a 67% cut in expired blood units as a result. The

light, all-electric ﬂeet required less labor and fuel (boosting eﬃciency),

eliminated the need to traverse hazardous ﬂooded roads (resilience),

and the move elevated the country’s global reputation for healthcare
