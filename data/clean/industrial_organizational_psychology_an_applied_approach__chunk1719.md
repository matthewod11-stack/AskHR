performance-evaluation results as being more fair. Furthermore, many supervisors who make such ratings prefer many of the behavioral approaches (Dickenson & Zellinger, ). Finally, feedback from behavior-based methods is easier to give and to use to provide suggestions for improvement.

It is important to understand that although the various performance appraisal methods may yield results that are technically similar, the way in which the performance appraisal system is administered can affect employee trust and satisfaction. Gaby and Woehr () found that the greater the employee perception of the fairness of the performance appraisal system, the greater was their job satisfaction and commitment to the organization.

Though many of the behavioral methods yield similar results, the same is not true when comparing subjective and objective methods. A meta- analysis by Bommer, Johnson, Rich, Podsakoff, and Mackenzie () indicates that objective and subjective results are only slightly correlated (r = .). Interestingly, there was a stronger relationship between objective and subjective ratings of quantity (r = .) than between objective and subjective ratings of quality (r = .).

From a legal perspective, courts are more interested in the due process afforded by a performance appraisal system than in its technical aspects. Reviews of  circuit court (Werner & Bolino, ) and  federal district court cases (Foster, Dunleavy, Campion, & Steubing, ) suggest that decisions based on performance appraisal ratings are most likely to survive a legal challenge if they are based on a job analysis, raters received training and written instructions, raters had the opportunity to actually observe the performance of the employee, performance standards had been communicated to the employee, employees were allowed to review and comment on the appraisal results, employees were warned
