A study led by Adam Galinsky at Columbia University illustrates the

power of perspective-taking. Students were shown a photo of an elderly

man sitting next to a newspaper stand and were asked to write a short

essay about a typical day in his life. Galinsky divided the students

into three groups. The control group was asked to simply describe the

man’s day. The second group was told to describe his day without using

stereotypes, and the people in the third group were instructed to write

the essay in the ﬁrst person, imagining themselves as the man.
