Another principle implicit in Bayesian reasoning is informational irreversibility—if you find out a piece

of evidence is mistaken, the brain should reverse its impact on judgment. (For example, juries are instructed to

ignore certain statements after they have been heard.) But the brain is an organ, as is human skin. When skin is

grafted onto skin, the old and new merge and eventually it is impossible to undo the graft. Information in the

brain is probably organically irreversible in a similar way. For example, when people find out that an event

occurred, it is hard to resist a “hindsight bias”, which biases recollection of ex ante probability in the direction
