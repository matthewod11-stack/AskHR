In a globalized world, businesses increasingly look to international

markets for growth. But cutting deals across borders is diﬃcult. Teams

of individuals from various cultures must negotiate in the face of diﬀering expectations about not only the outcome but also the process.

The parties may lack both a common language and shared working

norms, complicating an already complex endeavor.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

In bridging these gaps, negotiators are often left to fend for themselves,

relying on anecdotal or conventional wisdom that has little bearing

on the negotiation at hand. Or they may turn to academic or other theories that seem to explain cultural diﬀerences but generalize

about cultures as a whole, ignoring individual variances. All this may

encourage dealmakers to overascribe negotiation diﬃculties to cultural diﬀerences.

In one contract negotiation we studied, a German negotiator attributed

problems with his Chinese counterpart and the deal’s stalled progress to

his lack of understanding of Chinese culture. The Chinese negotiator repeatedly rejected terms oﬀered by the German, even when they

aligned with international standards. Instead, he pushed for terms that

he claimed met local Chinese standards. When asked for evidence, the Chinese negotiator seemed oﬀended and said that the German

negotiator should trust his word.

Later in the negotiation, after they had agreed on several points, the

Chinese negotiator kept reopening issues while presenting no legitimate

reasons for doing so. He consistently pushed to improve the terms of

the deal to his advantage and rejected counterbalancing suggestions,

slowly but surely transferring more value away from the German

negotiator. Whenever the German negotiator objected, his counterpart

stated that this was necessary to build a long-term partnership the

Chinese way. Only much later, after coaching by a negotiation expert,

did the German negotiator realize that his counterpart had been using cultural diﬀerences as a smokescreen for questionable and adversarial

# behaviors.

So how can negotiators successfully navigate the complexities of

culture? We’ve been researching, teaching, and advising on cross-

cultural negotiation and multicultural teamwork as well as conducting

negotiations ourselves for a collective ﬁve decades. Through this work,

we’ve come to realize that the secret to good outcomes in cross-cultural

contexts involves respecting four basic rules: First, look past cultural diﬀerences and focus instead on individual players. Second, work out

whether your counterpart is seeking to exploit a perceived advantage or

is interested in generating value for both parties. Third, create shared

norms for the negotiation (rather than adapting to the other party’s rituals). Finally, leverage the diﬀerences in preferences between parties

to improve outcomes for everyone. Following these four rules will help

you create a stable and lasting deal.

Let’s begin by looking at why it’s best to focus on the person
