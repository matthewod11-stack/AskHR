# 294 Assessment Psychology

educational, occupational, and other everyday life activities. Armed with this information, psychologists and the people to whom they consult can predict degrees of success and failure in these activities, identify what kinds of skill improvements are needed to enhance success level, and propose types of intervention or training that will be likely to enhance these deﬁcient skills in the particular person being evaluated. In addition to basing performance predictions and treatment plans on the nature and extent of functioning deﬁcits associ- ated with brain damage from whatever source, neuropsycho- logical examiners can use retesting data to monitor changes in functioning capacity over time. Reﬁned measures of neu- ropsychological functioning can help to assess the rate and amount of declining capacity in conditions that involve progressive deterioration, and they can likewise quantify the pace of progress in persons recovering from brain disease or injury. Neuropsychological assessment has consequently be- come common practice in diverse applied settings ranging from forensic consultation to rehabilitation planning.
