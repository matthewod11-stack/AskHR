## Relative Effects across Contemporary Leadership Styles

An ancillary aim of the current research was to estimate the relative effects of ethical,

authentic, servant, and abusive leadership. As discussed, the leadership literature has been

critiqued for construct redundancy, with high correlations being observed between

supposedly distinct leadership styles (e.g., Banks et al., 2018). One way to address this issue

is through critical tests of theory where popular leadership styles are examined concurrently

to determine the value of each construct. Several recent meta-analyses have made progress in

this regard (e.g., Banks et al., 2016; Hoch et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020; Ng &

Feldman, 2015) and we seek to contribute to this literature.

Our findings have important implications for the leadership field. On the one hand,
