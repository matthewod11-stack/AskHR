leadership styles, some of which may be redundant (Banks et al., 2018). As noted, some of

this potential redundancy is particularly evident when looking at the underlying dimensions

proposed to be part of the different leadership styles. Relatedly because the scales used to

measure leadership styles are typically follower rated, responses may represent followersâ€™

overall evaluation of their leader rather than any specific leadership behaviour or style (e.g.,

Lee et al., 2015). This is an issue within the wider leadership literature that needs to be

addressed in future research. Despite the overlap between the leadership styles alluded to

above, our relative weights and incremental validity analysis can begin to highlight where

uniqueness between them does in fact exist.
