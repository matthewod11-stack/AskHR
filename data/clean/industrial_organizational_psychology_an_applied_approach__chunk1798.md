# Mixed-Standard Scales

To overcome some of the problems of forced-choice scales, Blanz and Ghiselli () developed mixed-standard scales, an example of which is shown in Figure .. Mixed-standard scales are developed by having employees rate job behaviors and critical incidents on the extent to which they represent vari- ous levels of job performance. For each job dimension, a behavior or incident is chosen that represents excellent performance, average performance, and poor performance. These behaviors then are shuffled, and the end results look similar to those shown in Figure ..

To evaluate an employee, a supervisor reads each behavior and places a plus ( + ) next to it when a particular employee’s behavior is usually better than the behavior listed, a zero () if the employee’s behavior is about the same as the behavior listed, or a minus (−) if the employee’s behavior is usually worse than the behavior listed. To arrive at a score for each scale, the supervisor uses a chart like the one shown in Table .. An overall score can be obtained by summing the scores from each of the scales.

Although mixed-standard scales are less complicated than forced-choice scales, they also have their drawbacks. The most important is that supervisors often make what are called “logical rating errors.” For example, it would make no sense for a supervisor to rate an employee as better than the example of excellent performance or worse than the example of poor performance. Yet these types of errors are common. Logical rating errors can still be scored by using the revised scoring method developed by Saal () (Table .), but their existence alone casts doubt on the accuracy of the entire performance appraisal.
