## The Psychology of Women Section of the British Psychological Association

The Psychology of Women Section of the British Psycholog- ical Association (BPA) was established in 1988. The goals of the section are to provide a forum for research, teaching, and practice on the psychology of women and to eliminate gender inequality in the BPA and the ﬁeld of psychology (Psychol- ogy of Women Section, 2000). The section holds conferences and symposia annually, provides support for other events, and works within the BPA to inﬂuence policy and promote research on the psychology of women and gender. One pro- ject that the section has undertaken is an investigation of the portrayal of women in British undergraduate psychology courses.

In sum, a number of organizations have been founded to further the development of the ﬁeld of psychology of women and gender. Although we have not provided an exhaustive description of their activities, all have made important contri- butions to feminist psychology and, in turn, to changing the ﬁeld of psychology and the way its practices affect society.
