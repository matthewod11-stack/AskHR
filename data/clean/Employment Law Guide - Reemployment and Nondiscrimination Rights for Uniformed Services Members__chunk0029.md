Uniformed service includes active duty, active duty for training, inactive duty training (such as drills), initial

active duty training, and funeral honors duty performed by National Guard and reserve members, as well as

the period for which a person is absent from a position of employment for the purpose of an examination to

determine ﬁtness to perform any such duty.

USERRA covers nearly all employees, including part-time and probationary employees. USERRA applies to virtually all U.S. employers, regardless of size.

USERRA prohibits employment discrimination against a person on the basis of past military service, current

military obligations, or intent to serve. An employer must not deny initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any beneﬁt of employment to a person on the basis of a past, present, or future

service obligation. In addition, an employer must not retaliate against a person because of an action taken to

enforce or exercise any USERRA right or for assisting in an USERRA investigation.

The pre-service employer must reemploy servicemembers returning from a period of service in the uniformed

services if those servicemembers meet ﬁve criteria:

The person must have been absent from a civilian job on account of service in the uniformed services;

The person must have given advance notice to the employer that he or she was leaving the job for service

in the uniformed services, unless such notice was precluded by military necessity or otherwise impossible
