# alignment.

As a result of the supply chain disruptions, one of our clients, a senior

director of global procurement, had an idea that would dramatically

reduce outsourcing, and therefore reliance on the global supply

chain. Knowing his idea was a radical departure from the company’s

existing process, and having identiﬁed his boss as a passive player,

one motivated by risk reduction, our client decided to bring up his

objective in stages. This gave his boss time to acclimatize himself to

the conversation. First, he shared his idea at a high level to gauge his

boss’ openness. In their next discussion, he gave a broad overview of the

problem and the risk it posed to the enterprise. He gave his boss time to digest that, and only when he felt his boss was suﬃciently engaged with

the issue, did he bring up his change agenda.

Considering your personal motives and risks

The ﬁnal domain you want to consider is your personal motives and

risks — knowing what’s at stake for yourself, what’s required of you, and

what you’re willing to settle for.
