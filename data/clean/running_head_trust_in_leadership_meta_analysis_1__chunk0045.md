# authentic leadership and this, along with the unbiased processing of self-relevant information

and fair treatment of followers, is likely to influence a follower’s willingness to be vulnerable

to their leaders and trust them (Ilies et al., 2005). Ethical leader behaviours are argued to

influence follower’s willingness to be vulnerable because of the psychologically safe working

environment they create (Den Hartog, 2018). Ethical leaders for example, encourage

employees to voice concerns and show fair treatment and balanced decision making (Brown

et al., 2005) and empirical links to trust are found (e.g., Newman et al., 2014). SET has also

been used to provide an explanation of how servant leadership influences the trust between

followers and their leader (Lee et al., 2020). Servant leaders build trust by putting their own

self-interests second to the interests of their followers and focusing on the greater good. In
