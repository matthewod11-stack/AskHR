# Proximity bias

An other form of bias I observed was proximity bias, or the tendency

to think that people who are in your physical orbit do the most

important work. A hybrid work environment exacerbates this bias and

was penalizing women at HAPI Consulting, where men were more likely than women to come into the oﬃce. Reviewers tended to express

skepticism, or at least confusion, about what women did when they

worked remotely, whereas they tended to give men the beneﬁt of the

doubt and assume that they were more focused and productive.

Even when women came into the oﬃce as often as men, reviewers

assigned them achievement levels that were a statistically signiﬁcant

3% lower than those they assigned to the men. And when women came into the oﬃce more than men, reviewers seemed to believe that they

were doing so only because they were looking out for themselves and

wanted to “have a seat at the table” to defend their position in the

reorganization of the company. Conversely, when men came into the oﬃce an above-average amount, they were seen as strong leaders.

To address this problem of proximity bias, I administered a survey

to employees to gauge their preferences among several choices: more

online gatherings, an “anchor day” when everybody was expected to be in the oﬃce, or more oﬀsite team-building opportunities. The

employees’ preference was that the company create an anchor day,

which it did. This intervention led to a statistically signiﬁcant drop

in proximity bias that was observable in the next performance-review

cycle. In addition to having employees post their current projects on

a virtual whiteboard each week, teams were also asked to hold weekly

meetings during which they would discuss three achievements from the
