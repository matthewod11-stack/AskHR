# over time?

(cid:4) How should longitudinal models of job performance represent performance curves (and what are the implications of failing to model these curves correctly)?

(cid:4) What is the nature of the error structure for longitudinal models of job performance (and the implications of failing to consider this structure)?

Answering these questions will provide guidance to researchers as to how to design their models and allow research to move beyond questions of model structure (e.g., should performance be measured with a linear term, or up to cubic terms?) and instead focus on other practical and theoretical questions (e.g., what predicts or moderates the growth curves?).
