# One-shot & few-shot

When creating prompts for AI models, it is helpful to provide examples. These examples can

help the model understand what you are asking for. Examples are especially useful when you

want to steer the model to a ce(cid:457)ain output structure or pa(cid:459)ern.

A one-shot prompt, provides a single example, hence the name one-shot. The idea is the

model has an example it can imitate to best complete the task.

A few-shot prompt 7 provides multiple examples to the model. This approach shows the

model a pa(cid:459)ern that it needs to follow. The idea is similar to one-shot, but multiple examples

of the desired pa(cid:459)ern increases the chance the model follows the pa(cid:459)ern.
