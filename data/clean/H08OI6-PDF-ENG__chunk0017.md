# Recognize incremental wins.

Throughout my career as a coach, I’ve seen how professionals’

momentum can stall when they overlook the everyday achievements

that collectively drive their growth. Last year, I took on a stretch

assignment to develop Fire Memos, a platform designed to help

professionals record and recognize their wins in real time. If you’re

waiting for the next major milestone, you might be missing the impact

of smaller wins happening every day. Too many of us underestimate the

impact of what we do. At the end of each week, reﬂect on your progress,

write down at least three wins, and commit to continuing to add to that

list. If you stick to it, by the end of each month you’ll have at least a

dozen achievements documented that you may have forgotten about
