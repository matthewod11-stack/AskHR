# the firm.

According to Wiklund and Shepherd's (2005) assertion, there needs to be more examination

regarding the correlation between a company's resources (VRI) and its organization (O) in

elucidating its performance within the context of the VRIO terminology. They propose that more

research should be done on the correlation because there are signs that managerial decisions

can affect how the firm's resources are used in response to changes in the environment and new

opportunities. Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) is an essential metric for organizations because

it can increase the firm's resources by focusing the attention of top-level managers on the best

way to use resources to find and take advantage of opportunities.
