## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 79

We have sought to show how person and situation factors are linked through motivational variables to predict a reasonably broad range of behavioral performance measures in various work con- texts. Industrial/organizational psychologists have historically fo- cused on the relationship between personality and performance. This chapter illustrates that we also need to account for situational determinants of behavior, as well as the mechanisms through which personality affects behavior. Pursuing this research will en- able researchers to make progress on explaining both perfor- mance and affective work outcomes.
