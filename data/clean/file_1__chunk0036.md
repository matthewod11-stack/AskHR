# INTRODUCTION

This thesis examines how individuals with different backgrounds and employees from various workplaces perceive gender inequality and the gender pay gap. It also analyzes employees’ reactions to pay inequity. In this chapter, I introduce the topic of the thesis and outline its main purpose. I start by providing a background to the topic of gender inequality and gender pay disparity. I then turn to outlining the research gap, defining the research aim and formulating the objectives of the thesis. Next, I highlight the key definitions, which are used in the dissertation. Further on, I discuss the national context of Finland, the empirical context in which this research is carried out. I conclude the chapter by describing the structure of the thesis.

1.1. Gender inequality and gender pay gap

On the previous page of the thesis, the ‘Minna Canth and Equality’ collector coin is illustrated. It was designed by the sculptor Reijo Paavilainen in his work ‘Eye of a Needle’. The front of the coin illustrates one side of a woman’s face overlaid with handwriting from Canth’s descriptions of the fate of women from her extensive dramatic works. The backside shows a needle in the shape of the womanhood symbol. The front side represents the eye of the needle, where a thread of Canth’s written text forming an image of equality is shown.

Through this work, Paavilainen wished to bring out Minna Canth’s achievements both as a writer and as an opinion leader in social affairs. Minna Canth (1844-1897) was a pioneer, a mediator, and an innovative radical in Finnish literature and in social thinking in questions related to gender inequality (Krogerus, 1997). She began to write while managing her family’s draper shop and living as a widow raising seven children. She was the first woman to be awarded her own national flag day in Finland, starting on March 19, 2007.

As exemplified by Minna Canth’s activism, the issue of gender inequality is not new as it has a substantially long history. This history is also reflected in academic research on gender inequality which has been expanded over the decades. Gender inequality has been found to occur in numerous ways. For example, women often receive lower pay for the same or comparable work made by men, and they are often limited in their chances for promotion, especially to top positions (e.g., Blau and Kahn., 2006; Groshen, 1991; Hannan, Schomann and Blossfeld, 1990). Some women continue to experience a glass ceiling in their workplaces (e.g., Arulampalam, Booth and Bryan, 2007). Some experience harassment and not very welcoming environments in institutions in the public sphere (e.g., Salin, 2009). Some have to struggle for the control of their bodies, and fight for equality in the face of domestic violence and trafficking (e.g., Jyrkinen, 2005). An imbalance between the distribution of household and child-raising duties between men and women also exists (e.g., Rantalaiho, 1997; Salmi and Lammi-Taskula, 1999). Men’s skills and qualifications often continue to be granted greater recognition and value than women’s skills and qualifications (e.g., Horrell, Rubery and Burchell, 1990).

In some countries, gender inequality manifests so that girls obtain less education than boys (e.g., Glick and Sahna, 2000). In others, women are discriminated in terms of receiving
