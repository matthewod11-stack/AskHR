# from our work.

Lindsey Epperly’s story illustrates this intersection of professional and

personal identity. As founder of a travel company, she had known only

success: “I believed that because my business was a success, I was a

success,” she recalled. Then the pandemic hit.

The crisis forced tough choices. Five months pregnant, Lindsey and her

husband (also her business partner) had to walk away from their home

to keep their company alive. But the real struggle was internal: “My

identity was so intertwined with my business that those stark months of

continued sacriﬁce, strategic attempts at gaining any momentum, and

painstaking attempts to hold onto a dream were actually attempts to

claw my way back to a semblance of success that made me feel worthy.”

Each business setback felt like a personal failure, each strategic decision

a referendum on self-worth. It took hitting “rock bottom” for Lindsey to

grasp a crucial truth: “Even in a season of professional failure, I did not

have to view myself as a failure.”
