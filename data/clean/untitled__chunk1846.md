## Empirical Studies of Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice

The years following Freud’s death saw increasing pressure for empirical evidence both for the hypotheses that underlay the theory and for the claims that psychoanalytic therapy provided an effective treatment for the neuroses. In a now famous, albeit controversial study, Hans Eysenck (1952), using data from the work of Denker (1946), compared out- comes of intensive psychoanalytic treatment, brief treatment by general practitioners, and no treatment at all for neuroses. Denker’s study had reported that, although psychoanalysis had produced a 44% rate of signiﬁcant improvement, other psychotherapies had produced 64%, and general practitioners had produced the best results with 72%. Eysenck’s analysis implied that the more intensive and prolonged the therapy (psychoanalysis being the best example of this) the less likely was the patient to make a signiﬁcant recovery.

Eysenck’s study left reasonable grounds for criticism, in that he failed to match the groups for severity (or anything else), and he left the deﬁnitions of cure unreported. In spite of these criticisms, two key conclusions could reasonably be drawn: (a) up to that time, no systematic, methodologically adequate attempt had been made to test the efﬁcacy of psy- chotherapy, and (b) the rate of improvement of the patients in Denker’s study vastly exceeded anything reported by psycho- analysis. References to the reports of Freud himself on the success of his efforts provided to be seriously unreliable. The application of Freudian ideas to the major mental illnesses was to come later, and came fraught with problems.

One consequence of the rise of psychodynamic ideas and practices was that, given the avoidance of biological methods of either diagnosis or treatment, no a priori reason justiﬁed why the practitioner should have medical training. Freud himself was to remark that medical training was unnecessary for the practice of psychoanalysis. In the United States, how- ever, until the second half of the century, psychotherapy was carefully regulated and deﬁned as a medical technique, only to be provided by a psychologist or social worker under the supervision of a psychiatrist. Indeed in some jurisdictions the supervisor needed only to be a physician without formal psy- chiatric qualiﬁcations.
