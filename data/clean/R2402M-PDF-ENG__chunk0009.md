# career—hung in the balance.

He was now puzzling over how best to implement his strategy for

reversing the trends: investing $1 billion in modernizing the factory

and pushing production from 85,000 vehicles to a staggering 170,000 vehicles a year.1 Though it was ambitious, doubling production would not only help the company meet rising demand for cars but also reduce

unit costs, increasing proﬁtability.

Paulo knew that his strategy would fail without the buy-in of one crucial

stakeholder: the labor union. In South America unions were more than

just collective bargaining entities; they were potent political forces.

With 70% of the plant’s workers in Aliança Automotiva Brasileira (AAB),

getting the union’s endorsement was pivotal to any revamp.

While there hadn’t been any strikes recently, AAB seemed to be throwing its weight around. The use of the andon cord2—which brings production to a standstill—had increased dramatically. Several weeks

earlier a gaggle of union representatives with placards had begun

gathering at the gates each day to meet the factory’s managers on their

way to and from work. Memories of a strike a decade ago still haunted

Paulo. He had been a young manager then, full of ideas and optimism,

and the strike had been his ﬁrst taste of the power the unions wielded.

Production had ground to a halt, and relationships had frayed. Years

later they were still not fully healed.
