## public policy exception to the at-will doctrine (Aalberts et al., 1993).

Case laws are filled with application on how each of the three theories has been applied.

Courts ruling have impacted what managers' can and cannot do in the hiring, firing and

disciplining employees. Furthermore, future company documentation may be affected

based on particular rulings, in any of the three theories stated. The breach of contract

theory dealing with implied protection, requires a contract however, it may be expressed

or implied. A definition of implied contract theory is "inferred by law as a matter of

reason and justice from the parties acts or conduct, the circumstances surrounding the

transactions making it reasonable or even necessary assumption .... that a contract existed

between them by tacit understanding" (Aalberts et al., 1993). The clause tacit

understanding is a gray area for both the employer and employee. Cases exist when the

employee has been employed for a reasonable period of time and given the opportunity to

be promoted, which leads to the development of an expectation for continued

employment. Consequently, the employment for the employee in question comes to a

rather abru.pt end. Given the th~e frame, trJs calls h~to question the terir.Jnation of said

employee, who continually developed with the company without error.
