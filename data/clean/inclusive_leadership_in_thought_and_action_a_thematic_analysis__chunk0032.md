content-analysis approach to develop themes. Using a basic analytical ap- proach that involved data reduction, data grouping, and the formation of concepts (Anandarajan, Hill & Nolan, 2019), we produced extracts of re- spondents’ natural language responses to the survey questions that allowed us to summarize concepts and themes. Further, by conducting both manual and assisted thematic analyses, we were able to validate the descriptions of leaders’ perspectives of and experiences with inclusive leadership.

Manual content analysis. To explore inclusive leadership dimensions and behaviors, we content analyzed verbatim responses to the open-ended questions using pattern coding procedures (Krippendorf, 1980; Miles & Huberman, 1994). First, two graduate research assistants independently an- alyzed respondents’ comments to identify common themes and formed content areas that captured them.They recognized a total of 25 themes and had an overall agreement of 86%. An analysis of the themes showed that most of the discrepancies were due to differences in level (i.e., superordinate vs. subordinate categories with the same theme) rather than content. For example, one coder separated appreciation and utilizing of diversity into two thematic areas while the other subsumed these dimensions into a single theme. Col- lapsing these ﬁne-grained distinctions into superordinate themes yielded 21 themes—11 for the ﬁrst question and 10 for the second question. These themes were then validated by a third independent coder, who recoded all responses using the composite list of themes for each question. This con- ﬁrmatory coding yielded 88% agreement with our themes. All disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus.

Assisted content analysis. To conﬁrm our emergent themes, the original tran- scripts were also analyzed using a qualitative data analysis program, NVivo. After entering the transcripts, we ran a separate analysis for each of the questions. Each question yielded seven second-order themes that we cross- checked with the manual content analysis. Comparing the autoanalysis to the manual coding, we found a substantive overlap between the themes provided by the auto-coding and those provided by the manual coding.
