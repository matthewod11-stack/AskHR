# Most effective leadership structure

The second aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the numbers of leaders in each leadership role and the teamâ€™s effectiveness. For each leadership role, a MANOVA was used to examine the differences between having zero leaders in that role, having one leader in that role, and having multiple leaders in that role.
