# Conclusion

Allyship is a topic that is beginning to receive more attention within organizations as well as from workplace scholars. We hope this trend continues and encourage it; allyship can be beneficial to the workplace, and it is the morally right thing to do. Although prejudice and discrimination still exist in societies across the world, every- one can take part in changing this culture. It is our hope that his chapter will inspire others to take up this cause within their organization.
