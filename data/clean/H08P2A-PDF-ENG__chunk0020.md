## natural processes and parts of every eﬀective organization. The more

you think this meeting will evolve into dynamics that people might not

want captured, the more you should consider whether it’s worth hitting

record. I once had an executive admit to using the record button to keep

the lid on a hot issue, but we all know that norm-setting and clear roles

are far better ways to manage group conﬂict.
