## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

There are no workplace poster requirements under the WARN Act.

Employers do have notice requirements under the WARN Act.

If an employer orders a plant closing or mass layoﬀ, it is required to provide notiﬁcation to the employees or their representatives, the state

dislocated worker units, (so that they can promptly oﬀer dislocated worker assistance), and the chief elected oﬃcials of local governments.

Notices to employees or their representatives. WARN requires employers to notify either the individual employees aﬀected by a plant

closing or mass layoﬀ or their representatives at least 60 calendar days prior to any planned plant closing or mass layoﬀ. If employees are

terminated on diﬀerent dates, the date of the ﬁrst individual termination within the statutory 30-day or 90-day period triggers the 60-day notice requirement.

Notices to representatives. These notices must contain the following:

The name and address of the employment site where the plant closing or mass layoﬀ will occur, and the name and telephone number of a

company oﬃcial to contact for further information

A statement about whether the planned action is expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire plant is to be closed, a statement to that eﬀect

The expected date of the ﬁrst separation and the anticipated schedule for making separations

The job titles of positions to be aﬀected and the names of the workers currently holding aﬀected jobs

Notices to individual employees. If the aﬀected employees do not have a representative, the notice is to be written in language

understandable to the employees and is to contain:

A statement about whether the planned action is expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire plant is to be closed, a statement
