more than a few dozen. Historically, academics have looked for

commonalities among languages and focused mainly on those used

by Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD)

societies. But, Everett says, the tide is shifting. Recent research has

focused on how languages diverge—and what those diﬀerences can tell

us about how we think and behave.

His book synthesizes his own and others’ research that brings in data

from non-WEIRD languages and broadens our understanding of how

words aﬀect cognition, including how we process the concepts of time,

space, color, and kinship. In the indigenous Karitiâna language spoken

in northwestern Brazil, for example, the terms used to refer to a relative

depend on the gender of the person speaking, not just the gender of

the person referred to. There’s a sense of symmetry and reciprocity in

Karitiâna that doesn’t exist in English.

Once leaders understand the power of language, they can harness

both diﬀerences and similarities to wield inﬂuence. As Jonah Berger, a

Wharton professor and natural-language-processing expert, explains in

Magic Words, there are speciﬁc words that, when used in the right way

at the right time, are more impactful than others—at changing minds,

engaging audiences, and driving action.

For example, in the workplace, a shared organizational language

(such as start-up founders’ use of the word “pivoting,” retailers’

use of “omnichannel,” or entire teams’ use of more personal

pronouns like “we” or “I” instead of the more distanced “they”) “can

facilitate conversation, make people feel connected, and increase their

perception that they are part of the same tribe,” Berger writes. This can increase feelings of trust and aﬃliation—and even the likelihood of
