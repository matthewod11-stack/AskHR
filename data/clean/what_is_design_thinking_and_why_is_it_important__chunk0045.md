# Design Thinking and Its Importance

strategies. However, both expert and novice used similar bottom-up (working- backward) problem-solving strategies.

Christiaans and Dorst (1992) conducted protocol studies of junior and senior college students in an industrial design course. They found that some students, mostly the juniors, got trapped gathering information rather than progressing to solution generation, but most of the senior students did not face this difficulty. That is, senior design students did not gather as much information, but they were able to solve the given problem. They asked for less information, processed it directly, and built up an image of the problem. They also prioritized activities early in the process.

A similar finding was reported by Gunther and Ehrlenspiel (1999), who con- ducted a set of experiments with a total of 20 novice and expert designers of mechanical devices. The researchers found that experts were able to clarify a task in a shorter time, whereas novices had to invest much more time in clarification. These findings (i.e., Christiaans & Dorst, 1992; Gunther & Ehrlenspiel, 1999) cor- roborate findings from Atman, Chimka, Bursic, and Nachtman (1999), who con- ducted protocol analysis studies of engineering students. They found that novices (i.e., freshmen with no design experience) spent a large portion of their time defin- ing the problem and did not produce high-quality designs. Therefore, and similar to the industrial design students in the Christiaans and Dorst (1992) study, some of the freshmen engineering students in the Atman et al. study were stuck at the level of defining the problem, which hindered their progress in the design process. However, senior students defined the problem adequately, which in turn resulted in good designs.

Ahmed, Wallace, and Blessing (2003) studied differences between the behav- iors of novice and experienced designers in engineering. The authors found clear differences between the behavior of new graduate entrants (i.e., novices) to the engineering design profession and experienced designers. The novices used trial-and-error techniques of generating and implementing a design modification, evaluating it, and then generating another evaluation through several iterations. Experienced engineers, however, made a preliminary evaluation of their tentative design decisions before implementing them and making a final evaluation. In con- trast to the novices’ trial-and-error approach, the experienced designers employed integrated design strategies.

In 2001, Seitamaa-Hakkarainen and Hakkarainen investigated the relationships between visual and technical designing using qualitative analysis. That is, they examined differences between two novices and two experts in the field of weaving design. Protocol analysis results revealed that the experts integrated the visual ele- ments (e.g., color, size, patterns) and technical elements (e.g., material) of weav- ing, and generally considered them in a parallel way during the design process. Iteration between the visual and the technical space was a significant aspect of the experts’ design process. The experts continuously moved from one design space to another to carry out very detailed processes of search for design solutions. In contrast, the novices organized their process around the composition space and rarely moved to the construction space to explore how visual ideas could be real- ized in weaving.

Similarly, using data from protocol studies, Kavakli and Gero (2002) compared the cognitive performances/actions (i.e., looking, perceptual and functional
