# Job Satisfaction and Job Performance

Irrespective of this lack of widespread interest early on in JAP and such other prominent outlets for organizational research as the Personnel Journal, starting in the 1950s and beyond, research focusing on job satisfaction grew by leaps and bounds. In fact, by the early 1950s, a growing number of researchers were publishing their job satisfaction research in JAP, including Kates (1950), BrayÔ¨Åeld and Rothe (1951), and Carey, Berg, and Van Dusen (1951). So much so in fact, that by the early 1990s, Cranny, Smith, and Stone (1992) could reliably report that more than 5,000 published articles and dissertations had examined job satisfaction. Coupled with this growing general interest in job satisfaction as a variable of interest, was a similar fascination with the possible role of job satisfaction in the prediction of job performance (Organ, 1988a). As one might expect, this fascination was based more on a practical, than a theoretical basis (e.g., Fisher, 2000; Staw, 1986). In fact, according to one of the preeminent early researchers in job in job satisfaction, Patricia Cain Smith, much of satisfaction evolved from work on the supposed relationship between employee monotony and boredom with job performance (Cain, 1942; Smith, 1953, 1992). That is, and consistent with the practical basis for the Hawthorne experiments (Mayo, 1933; Roethlisberger & Dickson, 1939), if employee satisfaction is related to employee boredom, and employee boredom is related to performance, perhaps employee job satisfaction is related to job performance (Wright, 2005). Obviously, this strong interest in
