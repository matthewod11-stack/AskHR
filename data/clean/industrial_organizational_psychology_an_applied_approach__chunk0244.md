# For the Instructor

xvi

preface

chapter, a list of learning objectives helps organize your thinking for what you are about to read. At the end of each chapter, a chapter summary reminds you of the important points you learned, and questions for review test the depth of your new knowledge.

To help you apply the material to whatever career you choose, each chapter contains an Employment ProÔ¨Å le containing advice from a professional, a Career Workshop box that provides tips on how to use the chapter information to help your career, a Focus on Ethics box, and an On the Job case study of an actual situ- ation experienced by a real organization. Although additional material has been added to the case studies, they have intentionally been kept short so that the stu- dents can apply what they have learned from the chapter and then compare their solutions to those of actual organizations. For some chapters, longer case studies are included in the student workbook.
