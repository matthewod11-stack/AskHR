# without devices.

It’s probably been a long time since you’ve done that. Commute with

nothing, not even the radio. Can you do that? Start getting better at

periods that are 15 minutes and longer of boredom, and watch your

life change. Number one, you’ll be less bored with ordinary things in

your life. If you get better at the skill of boredom, you’ll be less bored

with your job. You’ll be less bored with your relationships. You’ll be less

bored with the things that are going on around you.
