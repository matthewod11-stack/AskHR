Is it time to make a pivot or try something new?

Maybe you would enjoy and ﬁnd fulﬁllment from teaching a class at the

local college (or more simply, volunteering to be a guest lecturer). Don’t

take on too much change at once, but do consider where a change in

direction or a schedule addition would add to your life and happiness.

Perhaps you’ve always wanted to start a side business. Consider what

would be the ﬁrst step toward that new venture?

One leader I worked with kept a log of activities he found interesting.

He also created a list of fellow empty nesters he wanted to reconnect

with now that they all had more free time. My client found that he

enjoyed sharing experiences with fellow empty nesters, and that his

conversations sparked ideas for activities to add to his log.
