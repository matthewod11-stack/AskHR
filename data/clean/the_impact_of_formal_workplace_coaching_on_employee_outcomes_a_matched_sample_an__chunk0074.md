behaviours (i.e. turnover intentions and CWBs). This suggests that negative work- related factors may be more complex, with additional unknown influences counter- acting the effects of felt obligation generated by formal coaching. Replication and further theoretical exploration (e.g. Reactance Theory) may help explain why the negative work-related attitudes and behaviours for our coached and no-coach groups were equivalent.

We also encourage research into measuring informal coaching events accurately, allowing for a tri-group comparison of formally coached, informally coached, and no coaching groups on work related outcomes. Finally, future research could examine how formal coaching, informal coaching, and no coaching impacts on supervisors, exploring factors such as job demands, role conflict, and job satisfaction.
