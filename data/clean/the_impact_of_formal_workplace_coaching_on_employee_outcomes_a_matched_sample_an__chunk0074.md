# Conclusion

The practice of workplace coaching continues to expand (Ellinger, 2013; Schermuly et al., 2022). Guided by SET and LMX and employing advanced statistical techniques, this study develops HRD by demonstrating that formally coached employees exhibit stronger positive work-related attitudes and behaviours compared with those not formally coa- ched. To achieve the highest level of accuracy and reliability of results, we encourage HRD academics to adopt advanced statistical techniques (i.e. PSM and latent mean modelling) when estimating the difference between non-randomly assigned groups. For HRD practitioners, we advocate for formal workplace coaching as a core leadership competency and recommend that supervisors at all levels be trained and empowered to formally and effectively coach their employees.
