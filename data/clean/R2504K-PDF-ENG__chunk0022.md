# relationship.”

The question of whether to partner can come up at any point in the

startup journey. It may arise early on as you are assessing the problem

you want to solve or later when you’ve already gotten traction but may

be feeling overwhelmed or are looking to add a certain skill needed for

the business. Even if you decide you don’t want a cofounder, investors

may push you to ﬁnd one. In my survey, 50% of founders reported

that they had trouble fundraising without a cofounder and were feeling

pressure from prospective investors to add one to derisk their venture.

That said, investors are becoming open to backing solo founders as long

as the ﬁrst few hires have equity in the venture to ensure commitment,

align incentives, and build a strong team that can share the workload.

Wherever you may be in the process, consultants and advisers may be

able to ﬁll immediate needs so that you can make progress on your

venture. Remember, your ﬁrst hire doesn’t need to be a cofounder; it’s

perfectly ﬁne to hire subordinates, as long as the hierarchy, decision

rights, and incentive package (including equity stakes) are clear.

Consultants, advisers, and ﬁrst hires can become cofounders down the

road if there is mutual agreement that a partnership makes sense.
