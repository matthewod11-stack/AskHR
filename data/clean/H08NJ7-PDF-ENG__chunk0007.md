# What Is Coaching, Really?

The term “coach” originated in the 15th century in the village of Kocs in

Hungary. It was used to describe a type of carriage that brought people

to their destinations. In the 1800s, it became a metaphor for a person

who helps another accomplish a goal, and was used by students for

their Oxford tutors who would help them prepare for examinations—a

deﬁnition that remains relevant today.

According to Herminia Ibarra and Anne Scoular, in coaching, you ask

questions instead of just providing answers, support employees instead

of judging their actions, and facilitate development instead of dictating

what needs to get done.
