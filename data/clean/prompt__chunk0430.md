# Prompt Engineering

Growing research suggests that focusing on positive instructions in prompting can be more

e(cid:441)ective than relying heavily on constraints. This approach aligns with how humans prefer

positive instructions over lists of what not to do.

Instructions directly communicate the desired outcome, whereas constraints might leave the

model guessing about what is allowed. It gives (cid:453)exibility and encourages creativity within the

de(cid:450)ned boundaries, while constraints can limit the modelâ€™s potential. Also a list of constraints

can clash with each other.

Constraints are still valuable but in ce(cid:457)ain situations. To prevent the model from generating

harmful or biased content or when a strict output format or style is needed.

If possible, use positive instructions: instead of telling the model what not to do, tell it what to

do instead. This can avoid confusion and improve the accuracy of the output.
