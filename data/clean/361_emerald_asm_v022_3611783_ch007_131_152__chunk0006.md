# Allyship Defined

Allies are defined as “individuals who strive to end oppression through supporting and advocating on behalf of the oppressed” (Sabat, Martinez, & Wessel, 2013, p. 480). Allies are typically non-minorities who use their majority status to enact positive change. For instance, a White person might be an ally for people of color, a heterosexual person might be an ally for people in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community, or a man might be an ally for women. The idea of allyship has been discussed among scholars for many decades, although this particular term (i.e., “ally” or “allyship”) is not always used. For instance, an early discussion on ally development (Washington & Evans, 1991) relied on Helm’s (1984) work on racial identity development. Helms did not use the term “ally” when discussing how White people can come to terms with their race and use it for the benefit of others, but there are clear parallels. This demonstrates that the concept of allyship has been discussed for a long time in many contexts (even if the exact word was not always used).
