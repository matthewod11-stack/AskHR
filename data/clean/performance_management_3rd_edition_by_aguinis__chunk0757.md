# 5.2.2 Absolute Systems

In absolute systems, supervisors provide evaluations of an employee’s performance with- out making direct reference to other employees. In the simplest absolute system, a super- visor writes an essay describing each employee’s strengths and weaknesses and makes suggestions for improvement. One advantage of the essay system is that supervisors have the potential to provide detailed feedback to employees regarding their performance. On the other hand, essays are almost totally unstructured so that some supervisors may choose to be more detailed than others. Some supervisors may be better at writing essays than others. Because of this variability, comparisons across individuals, groups, or units are virtually impossible because essays written by different supervisors, and even by the same supervisor regarding different employees, may address different aspects of an employee’s performance. Finally, essays do not provide any quantitative information, making it difficult to use them in some personnel decisions (e.g., allocation of rewards).
