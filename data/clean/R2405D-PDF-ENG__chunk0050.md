# Empirical setting and subgroup analysis

- How similar is the setting of this study to our business context?

- Does the context or time period of the analysis make it more or less relevant to our decision?

- What is the composition of the sample being studied, and how does it influence the applicability of the results?

- Does the effect vary across subgroups or settings?

- Does this tell us anything about the generalizability of the results?
