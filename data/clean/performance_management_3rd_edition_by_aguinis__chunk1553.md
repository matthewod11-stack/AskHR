## Chapter 9 • Performance Management Skills

The importance of keeping thorough performance documentation and taking actions consistent with this documentation is illustrated by the outcome of several cases. In one such case, John E. Cleverly, an employee at Western Electric Co., was discharged after 14 years of good service.18 Western Electric was found guilty of age discrimination, and Cleverly was awarded back pay because the documentation indicated that Cleverly had been given adequate performance ratings and increases to his salary over a course of 14 years. Upon his discharge, six months before his pension vested, Cleverly was informed that one reason for his discharge was to make room for younger employees. As illustrated by this case, documentation of perform- ance should be taken seriously. In this case, the documentation available indicated the employee had a valid claim. In other cases, documentation could be used to discount charges of discrimination. If Cleverly had alleged age discrimination, but the company could show that his performance was deteriorating over time, then the company would have won the case.

What can managers do to document performance regarding developmental activities and performance in general in a useful and constructive way? Consider the following recommendations:19

- Be specific. Document specific events and outcomes. Avoid making general statements such as “He’s lazy.” Provide specific examples to illustrate your point, for example, “He turns in memos after deadlines at least once a month.” • Use adjectives and adverbs sparingly. The use of evaluative adjectives (e.g., good, poor) and adverbs (e.g., speedily, sometimes) may lead to ambiguous interpretations. In addition, it may not be clear whether the level of achievement has been average or outstanding.

- Balance positives with negatives. Document instances of both good and poor performance. Do not focus only on the positives or only on the negatives.

- Focus on job-related information. Focus on information that is job related and specifically related to the developmental activities and goals at hand.

- Be comprehensive.

Include information on performance regarding all develop- mental goals and activities, and cover the entire review period as opposed to a shorter time period. Also, document the performance of all employees, not just those who are not achieving their developmental goals.

- Standardize procedures. Use the same method and format to document information for all employees.

- Describe observable behavior. Phrase your notes in behavioral terms and avoid statements that would imply subjective judgment or prejudice.

Obviously, not all managers do a good job of documenting performance about the accomplishment of developmental goals or performance in general. Table 9.3 includes a summarized list of recommendations to follow in the documentation process.

Now, consider the recommendations listed in Table 9.3 in evaluating the set of quotes appearing in Table 9.4 reportedly taken from actual employee performance evaluations in a large corporation in the United States.20

We can be sure that the employees at the receiving end of these quotes would not be very happy with them. It also goes without saying that this type of documentation
