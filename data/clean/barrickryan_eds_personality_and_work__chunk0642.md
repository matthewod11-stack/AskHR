# 216 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Weak ties are not the same as structural holes. According to Burt (1992), the strength of the tie is not as important as whether the tie bridges unconnected parts of the network. Regardless of their strength, bridging ties are less constraining on an individual than nonbridging ties. The fewer constraints that are imposed on an individual, the greater are the potential network opportunities. In addition, bridging with strong (as compared with weak) ties is preferred whenever possible because it provides for more leverage or inï¬‚uence in a social system. This provides a potential advantage for low self-monitors, because they are thought to be more likely to develop strong ties than high self-monitors. Low self-monitors also tend to have more homogeneous networks (connections with sim- ilar others), which reduce the likelihood of bridging to dissimilar others that creates structural holes (Popielarz, 1999). Nonetheless, with their tendency to form strong bonds of solidarity with family, friends, and similar others, low self-monitors may have powerful re- sources available in times of crisis compared to high self-monitors.
