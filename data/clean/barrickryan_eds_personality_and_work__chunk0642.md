# Negative Ties and Multiplexity

Before elaborating more on the relationship between self-monitoring personality and social networks, two additional types of ties need to be mentioned because of their relevance.

Negative ties de- scribe relationships in which one person has a negative affective judgment of another in the network; thus, negative ties can be con- sidered to be at the opposite end of the affective continuum from strong and weak ties (Brass, 2001). These are aversive relationships such that one (or more) of the actors is motivated to avoid the other.
