# Why Unhelpful Help Happens

Our research identiﬁed three factors that contribute to unhelpful help:

- 1. Fuzzy Asks and Murky Understandings

In a culture where helping is expected, people ask for help often—but

not always clearly. This was Glow’s ﬁrst trap. Strong norms encouraged

asking for help, but people didn’t know how to ask for help eﬀectively.

Speciﬁcally, people didn’t want to seem too demanding, so they made

what we call fuzzy asks—vague, open-ended requests like “I just wanted

to get your input.”

As one designer in our study reﬂected, “Helping somebody help you is often quite diﬃcult when you’re overwhelmed with information and

you don’t know how to narrow down the question.”

Help-givers, in turn, were left guessing. One explained, “It was unclear

what the team wanted from me…I think it was more like, ‘Can you

come in and just be part of this discussion?’” The result? Murky

understandings that led to help that didn’t ﬁt the receivers’ needs.
