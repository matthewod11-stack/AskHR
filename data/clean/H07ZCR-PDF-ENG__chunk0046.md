Regaining trust will require both parties to take accountability for

what went wrong as a ﬁrst step to repairing the relationship. It also

won’t happen overnight. For Elena, this involved speaking to each

stakeholder individually to acknowledge her missteps and share her

rapport and take action to support others’ priorities to demonstrate that

the partnership was not one-sided.

objectives and the commitments that must be upheld by all parties to

achieve them.

Given our shared goal of [insert goal], I’d like to achieve [insert milestone]

by [deadline]. This is needed because [explain rationale]. What help do

you need from me to make this happen?
