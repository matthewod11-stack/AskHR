# Diversity Eﬀ orts

In this chapter, you learned that employment tests

must be valid and fair to pass legal scrutiny. You also learned that such methods as passing scores, rules of three, and banding can provide some flexibil- ity in who gets hired—flexibility that often is used to reduce adverse impact. Almost every topic in this chap- ter has potential ethical issues associated with it. From an ethical perspective, should an employer care about issues such as adverse impact? How far should an orga- nization go to increase diversity? Over the years I have had many discussions with colleagues who thought that their organization either wasn’t doing enough to ensure fairness in its testing process or was going so far to the extreme that minorities and women were being favored.

“It costs too much to learn whether a man is a good executive by trying him out on the job.”

“When I call upon any of my men for a decision, I want it right away. When his department calls on him for a decision, it wants

Do you agree with his reasoning about the importance of memory?

How would you have set the passing score for the test?

If the test were used today, would it be considered legal? Biased? Fair?
