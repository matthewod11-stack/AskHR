- Securing the family’s financial security is now seen more as a responsibility to be shared by the parents than it previously was.

- The main responsibility for most domestic tasks continues to lie with the mother, and the majority of women still feel they have too much responsibility for the work done at home.

- Both women and men consider that fathers should be more involved than now in the care and upbringing of their children. Workplaces may still regard the use of statutory family leaves as the right of women rather than men.

Two papers of this thesis apply data of the Gender Equality Barometer 2008, which started with questions about general opinions and attitudes that affect the whole of society and moves on to the respondents’ own experiences and attitudes towards equality in their workplace or study environment. Furthermore, the reconciliation of work and family and personal experiences of the division of work and decision-making were the topics of questions. Finally, the experiences of improper treatment and sexual harassment were examined.

The data for the 2008 Barometer were collected through telephone interviews conducted from January until March of 2008. One of the main advantages of telephone interviews is the absence of the interviewer which may reduce the impact on the way the respondent answers (Webster, 1997).

The 2008 Barometer was conducted with a representative sample of the Finnish population, which consisted of approximately 2,500 individuals of a larger population aged 15-74. The response rate was very high: 64%. The 2008 Barometer distinguished three essential types of population: full and part-time employees, full and part-time entrepreneurs or self-employed persons, and full-time students. The final sample size for the first paper was 610/606 employees (perceptions of societal gender inequality/perceptions of workplace gender inequality). The final sample size for the second thesis paper was 1583 individuals (perceptions of overall gender inequality).
