## Models Random forest Decision Tree Gradient Boosting AdaBoost

Precision 83.33% 52.38% 62.96% 56.52%

Accuracy 86.05% 83.67% 85.71% 84.35%

F1 Score 32.78% 31.42% 44.73% 36.11%

Recall 20.40% 22.44% 34.69% 26.53%

By referring to the table above, it was evident that the Random Forest algorithm had the highest accuracy (86.05%), followed by Gradient Boosting (85.71%) and Decision Tree (83.67%) respectively. AdaBoost has the lowest accuracy (84.35%). Concerning precision, the Random Forest algorithm again had the highest precision (83.33%), followed by Gradient Boosting (62.96%) and AdaBoost (56.52%) accordingly. The Decision Tree algorithm had a relatively lower precision (52.38%).

5.2 Business Impact 5.2.1 Benefits of Implementing the Models on the Organizations in the USA Diminishing turnover costs: By deploying the proposed modelsâ€™ organizations in the USA can identify high-performing employees at risk of quitting, and subsequently take proactive steps to retain them, saving significant organizational resources.

Enhanced Talent Management: Implementing the proposed models can assist businesses in the USA understand the root causes of employee attrition. Organizations can target retention efforts toward specific areas by evaluating aspects such as compensation, workload, and performance rating data, creating a more engaging work environment.
