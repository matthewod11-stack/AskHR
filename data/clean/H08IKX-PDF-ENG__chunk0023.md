complicated and complex problems. During the World Wars, military

strategies were concerned mainly with mass mobilizations, clearly

deﬁned enemies, and battles over territory. While enormously

challenging, these wars were complicated because they involved

coordinating large forces, using established tactics, and having

relatively predictable outcomes. In these conﬂicts, at some point the

war ended, and one side was victorious.

In contrast, the wars and conﬂicts since the Vietnam War have

increasingly taken on a complex nature. The rise of terrorism, proxy

wars, and cyber warfare has introduced a new level of unpredictability.

These conﬂicts do not have clear front lines or well-deﬁned enemies,

and they involve multiple, often non-state actors whose motivations and actions are diﬃcult to predict. Since these wars have no deﬁned end

points, intelligence agencies and military forces must now adapt to a

constantly shifting landscape, where a more ﬂexible, adaptive approach

is necessary.

Turning to business situations, the J&J Tylenol tragedy is often viewed

as the canonical crisis case study, Yet, it is a complicated problem

relative to the more complex Boeing 737 Max problem, which has the

surface similarity of also being a safety issue.

In 1982, several people died after consuming Tylenol capsules that

a rogue actor laced with cyanide. These deaths led to a nationwide
