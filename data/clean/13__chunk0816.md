# HUMOR MECHANISMS

The humor mechanisms described in this section follow a fairly logical progression. Starting with the humor producer, we assume that individuals engage in social communication because of underlying social motivations; i.e., people choose to communicate with others for some reason. Those reasons might be apparent to both the producer and the audience (e.g., to convey speciﬁc factual information), or might be more veiled (e.g., inﬂuencing social perceptions of the producer). We suggest that humor is commonly employed as a tool to make social communications more effective in particular circumstances, which we describe in more detail below. Once the commu- nication is made, however, the focus must shift to the audience or recipients of the communication. In the section on cognitive mechanisms, we discuss the cognitive processes involved in interpreting social communications that involve humor. Finally, in the section on emotional mechanisms, we describe the emotional responses that are presumed to follow from the cognitive interpretation of humorous communications, and suggest that emotions might be the most proximal link to relevant behaviors or job attitudes.
