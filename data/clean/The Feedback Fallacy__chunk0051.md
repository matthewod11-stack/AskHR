# Good job!

Here are three things that really worked for me. What was going through your mind when you did them?

Here’s what you should do.

Here’s what I would do.

Here’s where you need to improve.

Here’s what worked best for me, and here’s why.

That didn’t really work.

When you did x, I felt y or I didn’t get that.

You need to improve your communication skills.

Here’s exactly where you started to lose me.

You need to be more responsive.

When I don’t hear from you, I worry that we’re not on the same page.

You lack strategic thinking.

I’m struggling to understand your plan.

You should do x [in response to a request for advice].

What do you feel you’re struggling with, and what have you done in the past that’s worked in a similar situation?

On the ﬂip side, if you’re the team member, whenever your team leader

catches you doing something right, ask her to pause and describe her

reaction to you. If she says, “Good job!” ask, “Which bit? What did you

see that seemed to work well?” Again, the point of this isn’t to pile on the

praise. The point is to explore the nature of excellence, and this is surely

a better object for all the energy currently being pointed at “radical

transparency” and the like. We’re so close to our own performance that

it’s hard to get perspective on it and see its patterns and components.

Ask for your leader’s help in rendering the unconscious, conscious—so

that you can understand it, improve at it, and, most important, do it
