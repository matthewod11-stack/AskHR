# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

stronger effects than MBE (see Table 3). To examine the relative effects of the contemporary

leadership styles over the full-range model, we first calculated the main effects of each

leadership style, including transformational leadership and contingent reward, on trust in the

leader. We also calculated correlations between the newer leadership styles and

transformational and contingent reward leadership (see Appendix A). As can be seen in Table

2, all leadership styles were significantly associated with trust in the leader.

Next, our relative weights analysis assessed the relative contribution of each

leadership style to trust in the leader and results are shown in Table 4. The results suggest that

the newer forms of leadership all have a relatively large association with trust in the leader.

For instance, servant, authentic, ethical, empowering, and paternalistic leadership all had a

relative weight over 35%. In the case of paternalistic leadership, both the moral (28.53%) and

benevolent (38.27%) dimensions explained greater variance than transformational leadership

(16.59). We could not include transactional leadership in this analysis due to a lack of

primary studies. In the case of abusive supervision, this leadership style had a lower relative

weight (21.83%) than did transformational leadership (39.01) or contingent reward (39.16).
