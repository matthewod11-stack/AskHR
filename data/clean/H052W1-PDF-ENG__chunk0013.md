Do a few practice runs

Returning from parental leave often involves executing on a new set of

complicated logistics. Dowling advises “trying to get ahead of them” as

much as possible to “minimize the sting.” Start with the basics: The ﬁrst

day you go back to work shouldn’t be the ﬁrst day your baby goes to

daycare or stays home with a new nanny. Dowling recommends doing at least a few practice drop-oﬀs or asking your sitter to start a week early.

“Get your child used to the process and accustomed to the caregiver,”

she says. Dry runs will help you, too. “Get up in the morning, take a

shower, put on your work clothes, feed the baby, take her to daycare,

get your Starbucks, and drive to the oﬃce,” she says. “Then literally

turn right back around.” If you’re nursing, try to add a pumping session

or two in there as well. Your goal, says Rousseau, is to get “a realistic

preview” of what to expect.

Be up front with your boss

Maybe not on your ﬁrst day back, but at some point, you need to

have an honest and “up-front conversation” with your boss about the

new realities of your life as they relate to your job, says Dowling.

Acknowledge that the “next few weeks may be bumpy” — your

emotions may be all over the map — but make it clear that “you are

still fully committed to your job and organization.” Think about what

you need from your employer and how to make your new situation

work best for you. Bring up “projects you’d like to be considered for”

and “work travel that you’re willing to do or not do,” Dowling adds.

“You need to proactively own your story; the more you can control,

the better.” Rousseau recommends asking for your boss’s advice and

counsel on how to reenter successfully. Be candid and realistic about

what can be accomplished in your ﬁrst few weeks and months back on
