# Change in Models of Work Performance

The nature of work and work performance has changed dramati- cally (Howard, 1995; Ilgen & Pulakos, 1999). Virtually all aspects of work and many worker requirements have changed. Much more than ever before, work is team based, service and information ori- ented, and digital. Organizations and teams are ﬂatter, even vir- tual. The job description, reﬂecting a stable description of the job incumbent’s duties and responsibilities, is no longer a ubiquitous phenomenon. Stable job descriptions still exist in many settings, but most work settings today require ﬂexibility and quick response to rapidly changing business conditions. Our theories and models needed, and still need, a different set of variables.
