## Originally the Age Discrimination Employment Act (ADEA) had a protective class

from age 40 to 69. Therefore, persons who fell into this category could not be terminated

on the sole basis of their age. Nevertheless, the amendment in 1986 to the ADEA,

removed the ceiling and now protects all older workers against discrimination in various

personnel actions as firing, promotions, layoff.~ a..nd directly affects the rights of em..ployees

as pension or benefit plan participants (Dube, 1988, p. 1 ). Discharging an employee for

their age, or attempted to pursue a different avenue, constitutes wrongful termination, if

the primary motive was age.
