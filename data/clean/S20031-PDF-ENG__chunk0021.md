# THE WAY FORWARD

Although most organizations have long had training programs and grievance procedures in place to address the problem of workplace sexual harassment, today some 40% of women say they’ve been harassed at work—a number that hasn’t changed since the 1980s.

The authors examined the programs and procedures used by more than 800 U.S. companies from the 1970s to the early 2000s and discovered that most of them had done more harm than good.

Employers should redesign training programs so that they treat all workers as victims’ allies rather than identifying some of them as potential perpetrators. And they should supplement legalistic grievance procedures with less-formal complaint systems to provide victims with quick responses that don’t spark retaliation.
