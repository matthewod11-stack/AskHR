# introversion/extraversion.

Leaders struggling with how to think about getting the best out of employees with diﬀerent cognitive proﬁles would do well to remember

that your people are just as diverse as your customers. Just as successful

companies obsess about their customers and the decisions they make, it

may be even more important for them to obsess about their employees.

By doing so, they can reveal the root of the emotional and functional

needs involved in making decisions about their careers — and create

work environments that fulﬁll these needs.
