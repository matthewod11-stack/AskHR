## response times in half to marketing teams

generating months of content in days, today’s

proven enterprise success stories show

that implementing GenAI isn’t just about

improving operations—it’s about reshaping

competitive advantage for years to come.

The business impact is already clear

Early adopters of large language models (LLMs) are already seeing remarkable results:

- Customer support teams are responding 20-35% faster to inquiries

- Engineering teams are reducing coding time by 15%

- Content creators are working 30-50% faster

- Back office operations are 20-50% more efficient1

Perhaps the most striking, top performers are attributing over 10% of their earnings to Generative AI implementations.2

Drawing from thousands of enterprise deployments of Claude, Anthropic’s AI assistant, we’ve found the winning formula is methodical: identify high-impact use cases, build strong foundations, and scale what works.

This guide shares learnings and real-world examples from organizations that have successfully navigated this transformation. Here’s the framework we’ll be following:
