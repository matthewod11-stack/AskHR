# (ATD Model)

The best-known example is the ATD competency model (ATD, 2014), formerly American society for Training & Development consisting of generic competencies, and the following job-specific ones:

- Managing learning programs Integrated talent management

- Coaching ● Knowledge management ● Change management ● Performance improvement

Instructional plan ● Training sessions ● Learning innovation ● Learning sway assessment

Each section specifies what to do, but not how to do it. In the case of performance improvement, this includes identifying the client, carrying out performance, cause and system analysis, collecting data, and other tasks.

- Recognizes clients’ and colleagues’ implicit

expectations. Is able to adapt to the organizational culture. ● Anticipates formal and informal communication
