# Create a Prioritized Networking List

Once you have created your map, the next step is to ask yourself, “Who

does my new employee need to know to help support their learning and

integration into their new role?” Some people on your map are going

to be more relevant to speciﬁc tasks or topic areas than others. The key

here is to be selective, strategic, and intentional and create a prioritized

list of people your new employee should meet ﬁrst.

Your goal is not for new employees to meet everyone from the

knowledge map as soon as possible. (There will be other opportunities

for broader socializing.) For instance, if you’re hiring Lauren, a new

product lead, you can identify the ﬁrst ﬁve people she needs to meet

— e.g., VP of marketing, the customer support lead, a member of the

design team, the head of sales, and the chief technology oﬃcer — and

let her know these are the people she is going to need to collaborate

and communicate with ﬁrst. When people know and trust someone personally, they’re likely to work together more eﬀectively and will also

feel more comfortable asking questions, proposing innovative ideas, or

embracing the learning opportunities in mistakes.
