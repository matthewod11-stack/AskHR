# Deﬁnition of Happiness

Before we can determine whether happy workers are productive workers, we must clarify what we mean when we say that a worker is happy. Although the term happiness is easily understood by psy- chologists and laypeople alike, it is vague and can encompass a number of distinct constructs that result from different processes, have different correlates, and often have different effects. For this reason, we recommend that researchers who are interested in sub- jective feelings of well-being and happiness focus on one or more of four separable components of happiness at work (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999). In this chapter, we use the terms happiness or well-being in general terms but refer to more speciﬁc constructs when discussing speciﬁc research ﬁndings and hypotheses.

The ﬁrst two of these components, positive and negative affect, reﬂect a person’s affective well-being. Positive affect refers to emo- tions and moods such as happiness, joy, excitement, and energy; negative affect refers to emotions and moods such as sadness, anx- iety, fear, and anger. Although semantically these two clusters of emotion terms appear to reﬂect opposite poles of the same di- mension, research has shown that positive and negative affect are at least separable (Diener & Emmons, 1984; Lucas, Diener, & Suh, 1996) and perhaps orthogonal (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988; but see Russell, 1980, for an opposing viewpoint). Furthermore, pos- itive and negative affect have distinct patterns of correlations with personality traits (Costa & McCrae, 1980) and speciﬁc behaviors
