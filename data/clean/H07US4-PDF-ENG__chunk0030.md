## HBR / Digital Article / The Business Case for Love

kitchen. Customers can see the shelves of fresh potatoes, tomatoes, and

lettuce, as compared to other fast-food restaurants that hide how the

“sausage” is made. The company has designed their customer oﬀerings

and experience in a loving way that shows its commitment to its values

and its customers’ ﬂourishing.

The unloving company, by contrast, is amoral and transactional, always

and only assessing how to maximize proﬁts or revenue. For example,

Delta’s recent changes to its frequent ﬂyer program are unloving.

Delta used to reward its most loyal customers with cheaper tickets

and upgrades. Under its new rules, a passenger’s standing with Delta

depends less on how often they ﬂy and more on how much they spend

on Delta’s credit card — it’s now a frequent spender program. This

change makes sense in a purely transactional world. But it confuses

who Delta is for its passengers, leaving them disoriented — which is an

unloving thing to do to those you serve. Perhaps sensing this, Delta’s

CEO recently announced plans to roll back some of these changes.

The loving company is thoughtful about its language. For example,

Home Depot calls its headquarters its “Store Support Center” to

reinforce its commitment to the locations where customers are served

every day. Capital One agents introduce themselves with their name,

their actual location, and a promise that “I’ll be your advisor today.” In

so doing, they not only personalize themselves to you, the customer, but

they also remind you of how they intend to serve you on the call.

Contrast this with those companies that refer to their employees by the
