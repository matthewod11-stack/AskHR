the other student in the library. She may feel that the scores are unfair because she studied harder than but received the same grade as the student she never saw study. Of course, the other student may have studied  hours while at work, but she would not know that. In this case, the student’s perception of input level may not match reality.

It is important that employees base their judgments on factual information. Of course, this may be easier said than done. In two national surveys, only % of employees stated that they understood how their pay was determined (Grensing- Pophal, ). This is an important finding because another survey found that % of employees who understood how their pay was determined were satisfied with their jobs compared with only % of employees who did not understand the basis for their pay (Grensing-Pophal, ). The results of these surveys suggest that to increase perceptions of equity, organizations need to do a better job of explaining their compensation systems.

Another way to increase perceptions of equity would be to allow employees access to the salaries of other employees. In the public sector, employee salaries are available to the public, although most public agencies certainly do not go out of their way to publicize salary information. In the private sector, most organiza- tions keep such information confidential, and some even include statements in their employee manuals that forbid employees from divulging their salaries to one another. Such policies, however, encourage employees to speculate about how much other people make. This speculation usually results in employees think- ing the worst and believing that others make more than they do. It is probably in the best interests of an organization to make salary and performance information available to all employees, although each employee’s permission must be obtained before such information is released.

Even if an organization were able to maintain complete internal equity, employees would then compare their ratios with those of employees from other organizations. The problem with such comparisons is that an organization has little or no control over another’s policies. Furthermore, perceptions of wages and benefits at other organizations most likely will be more distorted than internal perceptions. Thus, even if equity theory were completely accurate, maintaining a high level of employee satisfaction would still be difficult.
