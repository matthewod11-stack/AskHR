# Employee separation and retention:

Retention of talents is one of the critical strategic plans of the organization HR’s division. The

author introduces analysis to estimate the correlation and causation between elements and

logistic regression to estimate the turnover rate. Turn over rate is generally classified into two

groups: voluntary and involuntary. An effective employee separation and retention analysis

reveals insights into reasons for leaving regarding recruitment from other organizations,

following employee's career after leaving the organization, employee’s performance, and other

demographic indicators. The predictive analysis also identifies employees with a high chance

of leaving their current position to pursue a career change.
