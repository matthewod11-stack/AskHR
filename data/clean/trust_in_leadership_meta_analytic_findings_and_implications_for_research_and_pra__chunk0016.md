receive from that individual.1 In addition, believing that a leader is not honest, does not have integrity, and may take advantage of a follower is likely to make one unwilling to commit to the goals set by a leader, for fear of putting oneself at risk.

operate partially because of care and concern perceived in the relationship; transactional leaders seem to put less emphasis on the relationship and more emphasis on ensuring that they are seen as fair, dependable, and having integrity (character-based issues).

Hypothesis 1a: Trust in leadership will be positively related to job performance, OCBs, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, goal commitment, and belief in information and will be negatively related to intention to quit.

Although prior research has posited a positive impact on the variables cited above, it has not explored the relative magnitude of the relationships. We suggest that the relationship will be greatest with those variables that are psychologically proximal to trust, such as work-related attitudes. Behavioral and performance out- comes are usually a function of numerous other contextual deter- minants, and hence the relationships are likely to be smaller. We would, however, expect trust in leadership to have a stronger impact on OCBs than on job performance. Similar to arguments advanced by other researchers, our view is that OCBs are discre- tionary behaviors, are less constrained by abilities and work pro- cesses than job performance, and hence are likely to be more strongly affected by attitudinal variables such as trust (Organ & Ryan, 1995). For example, when one does not trust the leader, one is more likely to avoid “going the extra mile” than to reduce performance of required tasks.

Hypothesis 1b: Trust in leader will have the largest correla- tions with job attitudes (job satisfaction and organizational commitment), the second largest with OCBs, and the smallest with job performance.
