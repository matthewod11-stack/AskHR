## In an ideal world, higher-ups would instinctively and unquestioningly

champion your eﬀorts. But the truth is, your supervisor is busy juggling

multiple priorities and your project may have slipped their mind. If

they’re new to their role, they might be hesitant to throw their weight

around. In some cases, your boss may intentionally wait and see how

you go about getting buy-in on your own. Most of the time though,

leaders simply don’t recognize when their advocacy is needed, how

impactful it can be, or the obstacles you’re facing.

Regardless of the reason, waiting for support to magically materialize is

a sureﬁre way to aggravate yourself and potentially derail your project.

So, how do you manage up and ask for the help you need? Here’s how to

convince those above you to champion your cause.

Highlight what’s in it for them

Your boss, like everyone, is tuned into their personal “radio station,”

WII-FM (what’s in it for me?). To gain their support, you need to

broadcast on their frequency. In other words, connect your ask to how it

not only meets your needs, but also aligns with their priorities.
