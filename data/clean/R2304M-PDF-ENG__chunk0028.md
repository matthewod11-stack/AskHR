you use performance management to drive people out, as Facebook has reportedly begun doing, it looks like a rolling, unannounced layoﬀ,

ﬁrst round, his lead director might not be pushing for a second one so quickly. Two layoﬀs in a year is bad; three would be much worse.

Tyler could choose to raise capital instead. Although Puck’s trajectory

has slowed, revenue is still growing, so if cash gets really short, he might

be able to bring in more money through a ﬂat round. I wouldn’t advise
