In July of , Glenn Cyprien was fired as the basketball coach at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette after an anonymous caller said that Cyprien did not actually have the bachelor’s degree that was listed on his résumé. In October of , Kenneth Lonchar was forced to resign after serving as the chief financial officer of Veritas for five years when the company discovered he had lied about having an MBA from Stanford. In June of , Charles Harris resigned on his first day as the new athletic director at Dartmouth University when a call from a previous employer indicated that Harris did not earn the master’s degree in journalism he had listed on his résumé. In May of , Sandra Baldwin was forced to resign as chair of the U.S. Olympic committee when it was discovered she had lied on her résumé about having a Ph.D. In December of , George O’Leary resigned after only a few days as the head football coach at Notre Dame University after it was discovered that he had lied about lettering in high school football and about receiving a master’s degree from New York University.

These stories are tragic and may not be typical of résumé-fraud cases, but % of employers believe that it is enough of a problem to merit reference checks (Burke, b; Schramm, ). In a survey of employers in the United Kingdom, % said that they had withdrawn job offers in the past year after discovering that applicants had lied on their applications, and another % said they had fired current employees after discovering résumé fraud (Reade, ). In , legis- lators in the state of Washington thought résumé fraud was so much of a problem that they passed a law making résumé fraud illegal, a misdemeanor punishable by up to $, in fines or one year in jail.

Checking for Discipline Problems A second reason to check references or obtain letters of recommendation is to determine whether the applicant has a history of such discipline problems as poor attendance, sexual harassment, and violence. Such a history is important for an organization to discover to avoid future problems as well as to protect itself from a potential charge of negligent hiring. If an organization hires an applicant without checking his references and background and he later commits a crime while in the employ of the organization, the organization may be found liable for negligent hiring if the employee has a criminal background that would have been detected had a background check been conducted.

Negligent-hiring cases are typically filed in court as common-law cases, or torts. These cases are based on the premise that an employer has the duty to protect its employees and customers from harm caused by its employees or products. In determining negligent hiring, courts look at the nature of the job. Organizations involved with the safety of the public, such as police departments and day-care centers, must conduct more thorough background and reference checks than organizations like retail stores. Such checks are important, as demonstrated by a study done by a reference-checking firm, which found that .% of applicants had undisclosed criminal backgrounds (Mayer, ).

For example, a child-care center in California hired an employee without checking his references. A few months later, the employee molested a child at the

center. The employee had a criminal record of child abuse that would have been discovered with a simple call to his previous employer. As one would expect, the court found the employer guilty of negligent hiring because the employer had not taken “reasonable care” in ensuring the well-being of its customers.

In Virginia, an employee of a grocery store copied the address of a female customer from a check she had written to the store. The employee later went to the customer’s home and raped her. In this example, a case for negligent hiring could not be made because the company had contacted the employee’s previous employment references and had found no reason not to hire him. Because there was nothing to discover and because the store had taken reasonable care to check its employees, it was not guilty of negligent hiring.

Discovering New Information About the Applicant Employers use a variety of methods to understand the personality and skills of job applicants; references and letters of recommendation certainly can be two of these methods. Former employers and professors can provide information about an applicant’s work habits, character, personality, and skills. Care must be taken, however, when using these methods because the opinion provided by any particular reference may be inaccurate or purposefully untrue. For example, a ref- erence might describe a former employee as “difficult to work with,” implying that everyone has trouble working with the applicant. It may be, however, that only the person providing the reference had trouble working with the applicant. This is an important point because every one of us knows people we don’t get along with, even though, all things considered, we are basically good people. Thus, ref- erence checkers should always obtain specific behavioral examples and try to get consensus from several references.

A relatively recent trend in reference checking is for employers to “Google” an applicant’s name to find more information about the applicant. A survey of  employers found that in , % of them used search engines to discover applicant information and another % said that they would likely use search engines in the near future to check on applicants. Potential job applicants should carefully monitor what is on their blogs or social network sites as % of organi- zations reported that they eliminated a job candidate on the basis of information that was found on the Web (SHRM, ).

Predicting Future Performance In psychology, a common belief is that the best predictor of future performance is past performance. References and letters of recommendation are ways to try to predict future performance by looking at past performance.

Even though references are commonly used to screen and select employees, they have not been successful in predicting future employee success. In fact, a meta-analysis found that the average uncorrected validity coefficient for refer- ences/letters of recommendation and performance is only ., with a corrected validity of . (Aamodt & Williams, ). This low validity is largely due to four main problems with references and letters of recommendation: leniency, knowl- edge of the applicant, low reliability, and extraneous factors involved in writing and reading such letters.

Leniency. Research is clear that most letters of recommendation are positive: Fewer than % of references rate applicants as below average or poor (Aamodt & Williams,
