# Specific Leader Skills

Another way to think about leadership is that excellent leaders possess specific skills or engage in behaviors that poor leaders do not. After observing thousands of leaders in a variety of situations, Yukl (), Carter (), Hemphill and Coons (), and Gibbs () have proposed a behavioral “theory.” According to these researchers, leaders do the following:

. Initiate ideas . Informally interact with subordinates . Stand up for and support subordinates . Take responsibility . Develop a group atmosphere . Organize and structure work . Communicate formally with subordinates . Reward and punish subordinates . Set goals . Make decisions . Train and develop employee skills . Solve problems . Generate enthusiasm

In a job analysis of first-line supervisors at the Maryland Department of Transportation, Cooper, Kaufman, and Hughes () found the following skills to be essential:

Organizing Analysis and decision making Planning Communication (oral and written) Delegation Work habits (high-quality work) Carefulness Interpersonal skill Job knowledge Organizational knowledge Toughness Integrity Development of others Listening

This theory is not particularly exciting and is the least described in text- books, but it is the way leadership is most often practiced in industry. If this theory is true, then leadership and management are something learned; if the specific behaviors and skills important for effective leadership can be identified, then almost anyone can be trained to become an effective leader. There are many examples of such training programs currently in use.

The City of San Diego has its own management academy that provides inter- ested employees with the skills necessary to become managers. On weeknights and weekends, employees learn skills such as oral communication, report writ- ing, decision making, conflict management, and performance appraisal. After an employee is trained and tested in each of these important skill areas, he or she

receives a certificate of completion. Even though graduates of the management academy are not promised managerial positions, more often than not they are the employees who are promoted.

If you have ever attended a leadership conference, you probably have noticed that the training involves specific leadership skills such as time management, goal setting, persuasion, and communication. Such an agenda typifies the idea that leadership consists of specific and learnable skills and behaviors.

Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss each of the behav- iors and skills listed in Table ., many are covered throughout this text. A dis- cussion of a few additional skills follows.
