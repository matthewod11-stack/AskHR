# Relationships with Subordinates

Leader–member exchange (LMX) theory was developed by Dansereau, Graen, and Haga () and was originally called vertical dyad linkage (VDL) theory. LMX theory is a unique situational theory that makes good intuitive sense. The situational theories discussed earlier concentrate on interactions between leaders and situations, and between leaders and employees with differing levels of abil- ity. LMX theory, however, concentrates on the interactions between leaders and subordinates. These interactions are called leader–member exchanges (LMX). The theory originally took its name from the relationship between two people (a dyad), the position of the leader above the subordinate (vertical), and their inter- related behavior (linkage).

LMX theory states that leaders develop different roles and relationships with the people under them and thus act differently with different subordi- nates. Dansereau and his colleagues believed that subordinates fall into one of two groups—the in-group, characterized by a high-quality relationship with the leader, or the out-group, characterized by a low-quality relationship with the leader.

In-group subordinates are those who have developed trusting, friendly rela- tionships with the leader. As a result, the leader deals with in-group members by allowing them to participate in decisions and by rarely disciplining them. Out- group subordinates are treated differently from those in the in-group and are more likely to be given direct orders and to have less say about how affairs are conducted (Graen & Uhl-Bien, ). As one would imagine, employees with a high-quality LMX are more satisfied with their jobs, are less likely to leave the organization, perform at higher levels, and engage in organizational citizenship behaviors than do employees with a low-quality LMX (Colella & Varma, ; Griffeth, Hom, & Gaertner, ; Ilies, Nahrgang, & Morgeson, ). To become members of the in-group, employees often engage in such ingratiating behaviors as complimenting their leader. The extent to which these ingratiation attempts work is a function of such factors as the number of employees being supervised (Schriesheim, Castro, & Yammarino, ) and whether the employee is disabled (Colella & Varma, ).

In general, research on LMX theory has been supportive (Erdogan & Enders, ). Though in-group employees often receive higher performance ratings than out-group employees, the relationship between performance and LMX is complicated. Supervisors and employees often have different per- ceptions of the leader–member exchange, and such factors as the number of employees being supervised and impression-management attempts by employ- ees moderate the relationship between LMX and performance (Schriesheim et al., ).

To complicate matters further, supervisors can only help members of the in-group when the supervisors themselves have a good relationship with their bosses. That is, if a supervisor is well-liked by her boss and feels supported by the organization, she is better able to help or hurt her subordinates (Erdogan & Enders, ; Tangirala, Green, & Ramanujam, ).
