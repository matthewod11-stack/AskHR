Exceptions Bona Fide Seniority System. An organization that has a long-standing policy of promoting employees with the greatest seniority or laying off employees with the least seniority can continue to do so even though adverse impact occurs. For a seniority system to be considered bona fide, the purpose of the system must be to reward seniority; not to discriminate (Twomey, ). That is, if an organization established a seniority system to protect male employees, it would not be considered bona fide.

National Security. In certain circumstances, it is legal for an employer to discrimi- nate against a member of a particular national origin or other protected class when it is in the best interest of the nation’s security to do so. For example, for years Russian citizens living in the United States were prohibited from working in any defense-related industry.

Veteran’s Preference Rights. Most civil service jobs provide extra points on tests for veterans of the armed forces. For example, in Fort Worth, Texas, veterans who apply for city jobs get five points added to their exam score. Because most people in the military are male, awarding these extra points for military service results in adverse impact against females. However, according to the Civil Rights Act of , such practices are exempt from legal action. To test your knowledge of these exceptions, complete Exercise . in your workbook.

Did the Employer Look for Reasonable Alternatives that Would Result in Lesser Adverse Impact?

As shown in Figure ., if an employer proves a test is job related, the final factor looked at by the courts is the extent to which the employer looked for other valid selection tests that would have less adverse impact. For example, if an organiza- tion wanted to use a particular cognitive ability test, did it explore such alterna- tives as education level or other cognitive ability tests that would be just as valid but would have less adverse impact? To get experience using the flowchart in Figure ., complete Exercise . in your workbook.

An issue of growing concern in the workplace is sexual harassment. In , , complaints of harassment were filed with the EEOC and with state and local agencies; , of these were for sexual harassment. Of these ,, % were filed by males. Of harassment claims filed with the EEOC, approximately % involve racial harassment, % sexual harassment, and % harassment of other protected classes. Research indicates that as many as % of women and % of men have been victims of sexual harassment (U.S. Merit Systems Board, ). These percentages increase when employees are the sole representative of their gender (called gender pioneers) or consist of a small minority of the employ- ees in a particular work setting (called gender isolates) (Niebuhr & Oswald, ). Harassment is not an issue limited to the United States. Though the United States has taken the lead in preventing and punishing harassment, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the European Union also have laws prohibiting sexual harassment (Gutman, ).

Though the following discussion focuses on sexual harassment, the courts have ruled that racial, religious, disability, and age harassment are also illegal (e.g., Crawford v. Medina General Hospital, ; Lanman v. Johnson County, Kansas, ). For example:

In , Consolidated Freightways settled an EEOC charge of race harassment for $,,. The harassment included hanging nooses in the workplace, racial graffiti, and threats of physical harm. In , Fairfield Toyota in California settled an EEOC charge of religion (Muslim), color (dark-skinned), and national origin (Afghani) harassment for $,. Supervisors and other employees commonly referred to seven Afghani Muslim employees as “the bin Laden gang,” “sand niggers,” and “camel jockeys.” In , Lexus of Kendall in Miami, Florida, reached an agreement to pay $, for race, national origin, and religious harassment by a senior manager who made comments such as, “America is for Whites only” and calling employees terms such as “spic” and “nigger.”
