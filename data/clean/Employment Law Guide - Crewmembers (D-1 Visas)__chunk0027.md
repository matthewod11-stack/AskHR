# port.

As noted, performance of longshore work at U.S. ports by D-1 crewmembers on foreign vessels is generally prohibited with few

exemptions. The Employment and Training Administration is responsible for administering two of those exemptions. Employers in these ports are required to ﬁle an attestation with ETA which is valid for one year.

The attestation for the prevailing practice exception (Form ETA 9033 which is valid for one year, must state that the use of alien

crewmembers to perform longshore work is the prevailing practice for the activity at that port, that the use of such alien

crewmembers is neither occurring during a strike or lockout at the place of employment, nor intended to inﬂuence an election of a

bargaining representatives in the local port, and that notice has been given to U.S. workers or their representatives.

The exception for Alaska, which an employer seeks by ﬁling Form ETA 9033-A with ETA, requires that, before using alien

crewmembers to perform longshore activities in the State of Alaska, the employer will inter alia make a bona ﬁde request for and

employ U.S. longshore workers who are qualiﬁed and available in suﬃcient numbers from contract stevedoring companies, and

private dock operators. ETA administers the attestation process under the prevailing practice and State of Alaska exceptions.

The Wage and Hour Division investigates and resolves complaints that the employer failed to meet conditions to which it attested, misrepresented a material fact in an attestation, or failed to use the automated vessel exception properly. Complaints about such

matters should be ﬁled with a local Wage and Hour Division oﬃce.
