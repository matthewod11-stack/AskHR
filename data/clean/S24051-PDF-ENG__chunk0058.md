Editor’s note: This article, published in September 2024, references the fact that no U.S. commercial airline carrier has had a fatal crash since 2009. This was true at the time of publication, but on January 29, 2025, an American Airlines flight was involved in a fatal collision with a military helicopter over Washington, DC.

A version of this article appeared in the September–October 2024 issue of Harvard Business Review.
