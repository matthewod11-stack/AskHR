I have argued over the past decade that the Human Resources(HR) function has the potential to become one of the leaders inanalytics. The key word, I thought, was potential. Not anymore. Arecent global survey on which I collaborated with Oracle suggeststhat HR is right up there with the most analytical functions inbusiness â€” and even a bit ahead of a quantitatively-orientedfunction like Finance. Many HR departments are making use ofadvanced analytical methods like predictive and prescriptivemodels, and even artificial intelligence.
