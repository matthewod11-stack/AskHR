# Organizational Justice

Few things demoralize a person faster than feelings of jealousy, perceptions of favoritism, or beliefs that someone else is getting a ‘‘better deal.’’ Not only does a coach need to be fair; the coach must be seen as fair. At least four factors contribute to perceptions of fairness of a coach, namely, distributive justice, procedural justice, interactional jus- tice and the concept of voice.

The following questions are usually asked by employees regarding distributive justice:

What was distributed to whom? Who has the corner ofﬁce, received the coveted assign- ment, or was promoted or let go? Although the answers to these questions certainly affect perceptions of justice, often more important to employees are answers to ques- tions regarding procedural justice. Perceptions of procedural

justice are affected by answers to the question: Are there procedures, processes, or systems for deciding ‘‘who gets what?’’ If the answer is no, mistrust throughout the workforce is likely to be high. If the answer is yes, sub- sequent questions asked by employees include the following: Are the procedures representative of the thinking of the unit or that of a ‘‘chosen few?’’ Are they applied consistently? Are the procedures ethical? Is there an appeal system that people can use without fear of retribution? Do I have a champion? People become highly concerned with answers to procedural justice questions when they receive a poor appraisal.

Interactional justice refers to the interac- tions between the coach and the subordinate. To the extent that the logic of the coach is understood, and the coach is perceived as someone wanting to truly help the person improve performance, feelings of trust and respect are usually high, even if the employee disagrees with the coach’s appraisal.

that people believe that their views are taken into account before an appraisal is made. People are likely to support a decision that they did not initially advocate if they have ‘‘voice,’’ if their answer is yes to the question: ‘‘Was I heard?’’
