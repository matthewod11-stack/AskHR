Cleaning the press

Least desired

financial rewards. Instead, my boss rewarded good departmental citizenship by giving the best faculty their most desired schedule, their favorite classes, and their favorite committee assignments. From what I have seen, these reinforcers work better than money!

Of course, my boss was successful in using the Premack Principle because he had a good sense of every faculty member’s reinforcement hierarchy. For example, I hate serving on committees, whereas a colleague of mine gets her entire self- worth by chairing department and university committees. So my boss reinforced my colleague by putting her on committees and reinforced me by giving me some data to play with. Likewise, some faculty love early morning classes, whereas oth- ers would rather teach at night.

In an example from the research literature, Welsh, Bernstein, and Luthans () demonstrated the effectiveness of the Premack Principle with employees at a fast-food restaurant. Employees whose errors decreased in a given day were rewarded by being allowed to work at their favorite workstation (e.g., cooking fries vs. flipping burgers). This use of the Premack Principle resulted in a decrease in employee errors.

Even though operant conditioning and the Premack Principle have been successful in improving motivation and performance, a note of caution comes from Deci (), who believes that for some people and some jobs, work is intrinsically motivating. That is, people are motivated because they enjoy work- ing, not because they are being rewarded. A reasonable body of research, much of it conducted by Deci himself, demonstrates that paying a person for the amount of work done will reduce the degree to which he enjoys performing the task. Thus, when financial incentives are no longer available, the employee will be less motivated to work than before rewards were used. As interesting as this concept sounds, some researchers (e.g., Dickinson, ) argue that Deci’s conclusion that extrinsic rewards decrease intrinsic motivation are flawed. To apply the Premack Principle to your own life, complete Exercise . in your workbook.

Financial Rewards Financial incentives can be used to motivate better worker performance either by making variable pay an integral part of an employee’s compensation package or by using financial rewards as a “bonus” for accomplishing certain goals. As shown in Figure ., a compensation plan should include base pay and a benefits package to provide employees with security; salary adjust- ments to cover such conditions as undesirable shifts and geographic areas with high costs of living; and variable pay to provide an incentive to perform better. Though incentive systems often result in higher levels of performance, when designed poorly they can result in such negative outcomes as increased stress and decreased health and safety (Schleifer & Amick, ; Schleifer & Okogbaa, ).

Financial incentives in the form of bonuses or prizes are also used to moti- vate employees. For example, Chick-fil-A annually gives more than $ million in scholarships to employees nominated by their managers for excellent perfor- mance (Juergens, ). At Net in Herndon, Virginia, employees who stay with the company for two years and receive a high performance rating are given a three-year lease on a BMW, Dodge Durango, or Audi TT; and at Interwoven in the Silicon Valley, in the bay area of California, employees staying three years were given a three-year lease on a BMW Z- (Frase-Blunt, ).
