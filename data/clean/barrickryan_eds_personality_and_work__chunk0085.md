theory. However, the theory might omit some signiﬁcant summary constructs that a more empirical approach might reveal.

Alternatively, one could take a strictly practical approach. One could build up a taxonomic model incrementally by developing successively more and more measures, each constructed to predict some important human outcome. This is the approach that Gough (1996) espoused in developing the California Psychological In- ventory (CPI). Although Gough did not initially aspire to create a comprehensive taxonomy, analyses of the interrelations among the CPI scales eventually led him to develop some summary dimen- sions to encompass them. The measures developed by this practical approach typically have empirical strengths, but they are not the- oretically organized and may omit important constructs that no one happened to think of investigating.

Yet another incremental approach to variable selection relies on an investigator’s initial judgments of the most important vari- ables to measure, later adding measures of other variables that em- pirically turn out to be relatively independent of those initially selected. Comrey (1988) used this approach to variable selection in the development of the Comrey Personality Scales, as did Telle- gen (in press) in the development of his Multidimensional Per- sonality Questionnaire (MPQ). If many investigators adopted this approach and they all ended up measuring the same constructs, those variables would have some privileged status in models of per- sonality structure.

Unfortunately, this has not occurred. Despite the long tradi- tion of packaging structural models into multiscale personality in- ventories, until recently there was little agreement among them on the most important variables of personality, and consequently none of them had become widely accepted as a comprehensive taxon- omy of personality attributes. There are several reasons for this. First, research on each inventory has operated independent of that on other inventories, with little comparison or integration (Gold- berg, in press). Second, inventories tend to become ﬁxed in form at an early stage, with rare revisions to reﬂect new developments in theory or measurement; revisions may be scientiﬁcally desirable but problematic from a commercial standpoint (Goldberg, 1999). And perhaps most important, the rationale for variable selection in these inventories, although reasonable in one way or another, has not been particularly powerful.
