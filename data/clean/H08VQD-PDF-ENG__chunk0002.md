Are you afraid of boredom? In this video, Harvard professor Arthur

C. Brooks, author of The Happiness Files: Insights on Work and Life,

makes the case that boredom isn’t a problem to escape with another

scroll on your phone. Make room for being bored, he argues, and you

create the mental space to wrestle with life’s deeper questions of meaning

and purpose. You can watch more videos from Brooks on our YouTube

channel, including insights on imposter syndrome, professional identity,

and ﬁghting workaholism.
