## HBR / Digital Article / You Need to Be Bored. Here’s Why.

ARTHUR BROOKS: You need to be bored. You will have less meaning

and you will be more depressed if you never are bored. I mean, it

couldn’t be clearer. Let me give you the good side of boredom in general.

Boredom is a tendency for us to not be occupied otherwise cognitively,

which switches over our thinking system to use a part of our brain that’s

called the default mode network. That sounds fancy. It’s really not.

The default mode network is a bunch of structures in your brain that

switch on when you don’t have anything else to think about. So, you

forgot your phone and you’re sitting at a light, for example. That’s when

your default mode network goes on. We don’t like it.
