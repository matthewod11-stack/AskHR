## HBR / Magazine Article / The Power of Options

“care.” As a leader you may ﬁnd it diﬃcult to watch someone struggle,

but support is diﬀerent from protection. Look back over a week or a

month and ask yourself how many times you ignored a performance

issue fearing that speaking up would hurt the other person’s feelings.

Did you praise team members when you should have been pushing for

better results because you were worried about how they might react?

Remember, when a baby chick tries desperately to break open its shell,

you shouldn’t help it. If you do, it may die. The thrashing around is how

it strengthens its muscles so that it can survive in the world.

It’s not common for Don’t Lean to be a default stance, but people often

overrely on it in high-stakes situations, sometimes shutting down under

threat. That leads to errors of omission. Look back at your calendar and

ask if there were times when you did not respond to others or rejected

their concerns because it might have raised your stress level. Have you actively avoided a situation, such as a diﬃcult team dynamic, hoping

that the problem would somehow solve itself or that others would solve

it without your participation? If you are susceptible to this type of

behavior, work hard to recognize when it’s happening, notice what it

feels like, and consider other stances you might take.

As a general rule, it is best to Lean In when your team seems

directionless and needs help getting organized or galvanized. Lean

Back when more information will help ground you, your team, or

stakeholders. Lean With when people need support, encouragement, or

motivation. Don’t Lean when the team needs to work something out on

their own and your presence would impede their progress. At the same

time, inject calm and conﬁdence if they seem frenetic. (For a summary,

see the exhibit “A Guide to the Four Stances.”)
