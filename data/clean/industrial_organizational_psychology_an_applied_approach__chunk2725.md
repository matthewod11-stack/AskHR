# Chapter Summary

In this chapter you learned: 7

There are three types of organizational communication: upward, downward, and horizontal. There are three main problem areas in interpersonal communication: the intended message versus the message actually sent, the message sent versus the message received, and the message received versus the message interpreted. Interpersonal communication can be improved with more effective listening skills, understanding the six different styles of listening (leisure, inclusive, sty- listic, technical, empathic, and nonconforming), and considering the emotional state, cognitive ability, and personal biases of the sender and the receiver. Written communication can be improved by learning better writing skills and by writing organizational documents at a reading level that matches the reading level of most employees.
