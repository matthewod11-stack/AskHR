# Emergency Response Act of 2006 (MINER Act), is administered by the Mine Safety and Health Administration

(MSHA). The Act covers all mine operators and miners throughout the U.S., including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Trust Territory of the Paciﬁc Islands. Under

the Mine Act, a mine "operator" is deﬁned as: "any owner, lessee, or other person who operates, controls, or

supervises a coal or other mine or any independent contractor performing services or construction at such

mine." A "miner" is any "individual working in a coal or other mine." As of calendar year 2015, the Mine Act

covered approximately 350,000 miners and over 13,000 mines.
