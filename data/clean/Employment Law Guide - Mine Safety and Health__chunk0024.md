# Basic Provisions/Requirements

The Mine Act requires MSHA to inspect each surface mine at least 2 times a year and each underground mine

at least 4 times a year. (MSHA inspects seasonal or intermittent mining operations less frequently). Under the

Mine Act, MSHA is prohibited from giving advance notice of an inspection, and it is authorized to enter any mine without a warrant.

The Mine Act requires additional inspections to ensure safe and healthy work environments for miners. For

example, MSHA must provide additional inspections at a mine that releases large amounts of methane gas or

other explosive gases or where there exists other especially hazardous conditions. . In addition, MSHA must

investigate all fatal accidents and complaints of discrimination based upon the exercise of rights under the Mine Act.

To promote compliance with the requirements of the Mine Act or any MSHA mandatory safety and health

standard, rule, order or regulation, MSHA must issue a citation to a mine operator for any violation found

during an inspection or investigation. MSHA must notify the operator within a reasonable time of the civil

penalty proposed to be assessed for the violation cited. All violations must be corrected within a reasonable time established by MSHA.

The Mine Act permits a representative of the operator and a representative of the miners to accompany MSHA

during an inspection for the purpose of aiding the inspection and to participate in pre- or post-inspection

conferences at the mine. The representative of the miners who is also an employee of the operators shall

suï¬€er no loss of pay during the time of his participation in the inspection. If a violation is cited, the circumstances surrounding the violation are discussed during the post-inspection conference. If these

discussions do not result in resolution, the mine operator may contest the citation or proposed assessment of

penalty before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, an independent body, with further
