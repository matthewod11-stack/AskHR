# Facial Expression and Emotions

If there has been one persistent preoccupation of psycholo- gists of emotion, it has been with the supposed Darwinian heritage that facial expressions express emotion. Darwin’s (1872) discussion of the natural history of facial expression was as brilliant as it was misleading. The linking of Darwin and facial expression has left the impression that Darwin con- sidered these facial displays as having some speciﬁc adaptive survival value. In fact, the major thrust of Darwin’s argument is that the vast majority of these displays are vestigial or ac- cidental. Darwin speciﬁcally argued against the notion that “certain muscles have been given to man solely that he may reveal to other men his feelings” (cited in Fridlund, 1992b, p. 119).

With the weakening of the nineteenth-century notion of the unanalyzable fundamental emotion, psychologists be- came fascinated with facial expressions, which seemed to be unequivocal transmitters of speciﬁc, discrete emotional states. Research became focused on the attempt to analyze the messages that the face seemed to be transmitting (see Schlosberg, 1954). However, the evaluation of facial ex- pression is marked by ambivalence. On the one hand, there is some consensus about the universality of facial expressions. On the other hand, as early as 1929 there was evidence that facial expressions are to a very large extent judged in terms of the situations in which they are elicited (Landis, 1929).

The contemporary intense interest in facial expression started primarily with the work of Sylvan Tomkins (see above), who placed facial expressions at the center of his theory of emotion and the eight basic emotions that form the core of emotional experience. The work of both Ekman and Izard derives from Tomkins’s initial exposition. The notion that facial displays express some underlying mental state forms a central part of many arguments about the nature

of emotion. While facial expressions can be classiﬁed into about half a dozen categories, the important steps have been more analytic and have looked at the constituent compo- nents of these expressions. Paul Ekman has brought the analysis of facial movement and expression to a level of sophistication similar to that applied to the phonological, phonemic, and semantic components of verbal expressive experiences (Ekman, 1982; Ekman & Oster, 1979). Ekman attributes the origin of facial expressions to “affect pro- grams” and claims that the only truly differentiating outward sign of the different emotions is found in these emotional expressions.

Another point of view has considered facial expressions as primarily communicative devices. Starting with the fact that it is not clear how the outward expression of inner states is adaptive, that is, how it could contribute to reproductive ﬁt- ness, important arguments have been made that facial dis- plays are best seen (particularly in the tradition of behavioral ecology) as communicative devices, independent of emo- tional states (Fridlund, 1991, 1992a; Mandler, 1975, 1992). Facial displays can be interpreted as remnants of preverbal communicative devices and as displays of values (indicating what is good or bad, useful or useless, etc.). For example, the work of Janet Bavelas and her colleagues has shown the im- portance of communicative facial and other bodily displays. The conclusion, in part, is that the “communicative situation determines the visible behavior” (Bavelas, Black, Lemery, & Mullett, 1986). In the construction of emotions, facial dis- plays are important contributors to cognitions and appraisals of the current scene, similar to verbal, imaginal, or uncon- scious evaluative representations.
