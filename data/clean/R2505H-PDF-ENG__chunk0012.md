# The Challenge of Choice

It may seem obvious that founders who care deeply about their

businesses and everyone aﬀected by them should start the ownership-

transition process well before it’s necessary rather than leave so much

to chance. Beyond the problem that company owners are always busy, making transition plans can be diﬃcult for two main reasons.

First, very human emotions are triggered by the process. Letting go of

ownership means contemplating mortality. Planning a transition also

challenges a founder’s sense of identity. For people who have deﬁned

themselves as leaders of companies, letting go can be painful.

Second, ownership decisions have major consequences for families,

which have follow-on implications. A founder may want to pass the

company on to her children, but that can be more complicated than it

initially appears. For example, if one child is involved in the company

as the “heir apparent” CEO while the others are oﬀ pursuing their own

passions, how should that aﬀect the ownership decision? If the founder

chooses to give a greater share of the company to the future CEO, will

her other children think she has picked a favorite and resent her? If

she doesn’t give the obvious successor a larger share, will that person feel insuﬃciently rewarded? What if professional managers and other

employees are waiting around to see if they have a chance at ownership?

Will they leave after the choice is made?
