# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

An interesting finding to emerge was that abusive supervision, a destructive

leadership style, had the weakest association with trust in the leader compared to the other

styles included in our analysis. Abusive supervision had the smallest overall correlation with

trust in the leader and demonstrated no incremental effects above transformational and

contingent reward leadership. In their recent review, Tepper et al. (2017) highlight that very

few studies have compared the effects of abusive supervision within more comprehensive

models of leadership behaviour. Indeed, the authors called for research exploring “…the

relative importance of abusive supervision in predicting leadership criteria…compared to

traditionally studied leader behaviours” (pg. 136). Our findings suggest that, compared to

transformational and contingent reward leadership, abusive supervision has little impact on

trust. However, it is important to highlight that our analysis treats these styles separately and

does not account for the fact that leaders may engage in a wide variety of behaviours (e.g.,

demonstrate multiple leadership styles simultaneously). Studies have demonstrated that

supervisors who act abusively may also behave supportively within otherwise high-quality

relationships, a combination that can cause more damage than abusive behaviour alone (e.g.,
