# System Efficiency

Figure A.1 Layout of a fast-food counter (The numbers indicate the number of times the counterperson walked to get a particular item.)

A major human-factors area, at times referred to as “time and motion studies,” is making systems more eﬃ cient. Th ese studies usually begin with a job analysis to determine how employees perform their jobs. Th ese job analyses tend to be much more speciﬁ c than the ones you learned about back in Chapter . For example, suppose you were trying to reduce the time it took for a counterperson at a fast- food restaurant to perform his job. As shown in Figure A., the employee reached for ketchup packets  times, pepper packets  times, french-fry containers  times, and french fries  times.
