# professionals.

When evaluating AI vendors, leaders should prioritize those that

understand the underlying structure of professional decision-making

in their domain and can incorporate new information more eﬀectively

than approaches requiring complete model retraining. The same

principle applies whether you’re assessing solutions that understand

how new legal precedents apply to particular factual circumstances or

those that can quickly contextualize new ﬁnancial regulatory changes

rather than simply optimizing for returns.
