# Method

Many articles in the design thinking literature were identified and then col- lected. Table 1 lists and describes the online databases and Web sites that were employed in this search-collection effort. The focus of the search was to access full-text documents using various search terms or keywords such as design think- ing, design cognition, design behavior, design studying, design reasoning, design process, thinking of design, visual thinking, and prototyping. The search was not limited to a particular date range or experimental studies. However, slight prefer- ence was given to more recent research. In all, approximately 150 documents were collected. From this set, a total of more than 45 documents met the criteria for inclusion in the literature review. The inclusion criteria consisted of topical rele- vancy of documents to the research questions in this article (e.g., design thinking characteristics and processes, novice vs. expert design thinker, and the importance of design thinking). Both experimental and nonexperimental studies were included in this article.
