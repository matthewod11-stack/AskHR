# productivity, and leadership.

Executive coaching is diﬀerent from sports coaching. Sports coaches

instruct, direct, strategize, and drive their athletes to win. In many ways,

the sports coach is in the driver’s seat, with the team as passengers. In

executive coaching, the coach sits in the passenger seat, with the client

driving. The coach brings the process, but the coaching goes where the

client takes it and explores what the client wants to explore. This can be a diﬃcult mindset for aspiring coaches to understand initially.
