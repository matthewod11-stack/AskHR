Slovic and Lichtenstein (1968) were the first to notice that reversals of expressed preference could result

when people choose between two gambles, relative to pricing the gambles separately, a violation of procedure-

invariance (see also Grether and Plott, 1979). This insight lays the groundwork for using pricing institutions

(such as different auctions) to influence expressions of preference.

Human perception and cognition is heavily influenced by contrast. A circle looks larger when

surrounded by smaller circles than when it is surrounded by larger circles (the Titchener illusion). Since choices

undoubtedly involve basic perceptual and cognitive neural circuitry, it would be surprising if choice evaluation

were not sensitive to contrast as well. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the appeal of choices depends on the

set of choices they are part of (e.g., Simonson and Tversky, 1992; Shafir, Osherson and Smith, 1989). Similarly,
