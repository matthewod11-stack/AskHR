Table 1 lists some central rational-choice modeling principles in economic theory, emerging behavioral

alternative models, and some representative citations (see McFadden, 1999, for a longer list). I will describe

each briefly, and highlight domains in which competing alternatives are emerging.

Complete preferences: Completeness and transitivity of preference (which implies that choices can be

represented by real-valued utilities) is an extremely powerful simplification. But the power comes precisely

from excluding the many variables that a good’s utility could depend upon. Thinking of choice as a result of

cognition suggests obvious ways in which completeness of preference will be violated (e.g., Kahneman, 2003).

The way in which choices are described, or “framed”, can influence choice by directing attention to different

features. The psychophysics of adaptation suggests that changes from a point of reference (reference-

dependence) are likely to be a carrier of utility. A long-standing empirical problem is what the natural point of

reference is (and how reference points change). Koszegi and Rabin (in press) suggest a resolution that should

charm game theorists: The point of reference is the expectation of actual choice (which determines choice

4 Lucas (1986) notes because rational expectations often permits multiple equilibria, theories based on limited rationality might actually be more precise than theories based on full rationality. This is also true in game theory, where theories with rationality limits can be more precise than equilibrium theories (e.g., Camerer, Ho, and Chong 2004). So if the goal is precision, behavioral alternatives may prove even better than rational theories in some cases.

recursively, since preferences depend on utilities relative to the reference point).5 This approach creates multiple

equilibria, which permits a supply-side role for marketing, advertising, and sale prices to influence preferences

by creating reference points (e.g., Koszegi and Heidhues, 2005). This approach also provides a language in

which to understand how small changes in instructions or repeated trading experience could change behavior—
