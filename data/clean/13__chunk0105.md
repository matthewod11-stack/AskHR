## A Multilevel Framework for Work Team Diversity Research

proposed between management diversity and performance. In high innova- tiveness ﬁrms, there was a positive relationship between management racial diversity and ﬁrm productivity. In low innovativeness ﬁrms, this relationship was non-signiﬁcant. The results followed a different pattern with regard to gender diversity. The study found an inverted U-shaped relationship for gender diversity and ﬁrm performance in high risk taking ﬁrms. In low-risk taking ﬁrms, this relationship was positive. These results suggest that the type of ﬁrm entrepreneurial strategy (i.e., one focused on innovativeness versus risk taking) as well as the nature of management diversity considered (i.e., gender versus race) matter for ﬁrm performance. In another study, Richard, McMillan, Chadwick, and Dwyer (2003) found that ﬁrms that followed an innovation strategy beneﬁted to a greater degree from racial diversity than ﬁrms low in innovation. In an earlier study, Richard (2000) also found that racial diversity was positively associated with ﬁrm performance in ﬁrms that followed a growth strategy and negatively associated in ﬁrms that followed a downsizing strategy. Together, these studies indicate that ﬁrms’ business strategy is a key contextual factor that shapes the value that can be derived from diversity. In general, commensurate with resource-based perspectives of ﬁrms, more growth-oriented and innovative ﬁrms may be in a better position to harness the value of diversity in comparison with ﬁrms that are efﬁciency- oriented (Richard, 2000; Richard et al., 2004). These ﬁndings also suggest that the diversity within teams may also be shaped by ﬁrm-level strategy. In ﬁrms that are growth-oriented, diversity within the team may have the potential to contribute to greater levels of creativity and innovation (e.g., Bantel & Jackson, 1989). However, in ﬁrms that follow risk-averse and efﬁciency-oriented strategies, diversity in teams may be associated with ‘‘process losses’’ that impede performance.

Organizational History An organization’s history with regard to diversity-related issues can be viewed as a ‘‘blueprint’’ for current and future diversity management practices. Recently, applying a genealogical perspective, Phillips (2005) examined whether gender inequality is transferred from parent law ﬁrms to progeny law ﬁrms through the replication of routines engendered by the movement of founding partners. The study examined how organizational routines and structures are replicated by founders in the progeny ﬁrms, so that founders from parent ﬁrms characterized by gender inequality tended to replicate a similar inequality in the progeny ﬁrm. The study ﬁndings suggest that organizational routines related to inequality can be transferred across generations of employees and the extent of transfer depends on the degree of
