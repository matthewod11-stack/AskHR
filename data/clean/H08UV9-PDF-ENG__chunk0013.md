## familiar conundrum of middle-market enterprises everywhere: They

have big-company needs but small-company resources. On the PE

ﬁrm side, the people responsible for ﬁnding and evaluating candidates

are usually the ﬁrm’s operating partners (OPs), who may be smart

operators but rarely have HR expertise. On the company side, nearly

half (46%) of midsized companies say their HR departments are tactical

and operational, not strategic; and if they’re hiring as part of a PE

acquisition, they and their C-suite colleagues might not yet understand

the pressures and requirements of working for PE owners.
