 a Nice to Have

means taking a diﬀerent approach. It means creating space and time

to ask that person: “What’s going on?” Maybe he is unclear about the

task priorities. Maybe he is overwhelmed at work or at home. Whatever

the reason, your best response may be to work with him to reset

expectations, improve communication, or change his workload. This

isn’t about making excuses or lowering standards. It’s about helping

people to meet them and doing so in a way that builds trust and respect.

Niceness is about avoiding discomfort, staying agreeable, sidestepping

hard conversations, and letting things slide. Kindness means the

opposite. It doesn’t require agreement or even liking each other.

Engaging in hard conversations or raising concerns shows that you

believe the other person has greater potential or that you want to help

your team succeed.

## Kindness enables two other pillars of a high-performing workplace

culture: psychological safety and social capital. When people act

with kindness—by supporting each other’s growth, showing respect,

protecting dignity, and stepping in to help—they create conditions

where others feel comfortable speaking up, asking for help, sharing

ideas, and owning mistakes and feel a sense of purpose and inclusion.

That’s a psychologically safe environment. When these conditions build

trust, support healthy group norms, and strengthen relationships that

lead to collaboration and information sharing, that’s social capital.

Kindness, then, is integral to shaping how people collaborate, connect

# and perform.

# The Cost of Unkindness

Social isolation and political shifts have eroded kindness in all kinds of

institutions. Expectations of basic respect are no longer a given as we

move through our days. As renowned political scientist Robert Putnam

put it, people learn how to behave—what to say and do—through

participating in organized activities and communities, and when face-

to-face interaction fades, so do the behavioral norms that rely on it.

## In healthcare, data on how patients perceive kindness in their

interactions shows that poor communication and team coordination

negatively aﬀect their trust in their care. Conversely, when patients

experience kindness through actions that make them feel seen, heard,

included, and supported, their trust rises.

These dynamics aren’t unique to healthcare. The cost of unkindness

can be found in studies across a wide range of workplace settings.

The study of incivility that we mentioned earlier found that 98% of

employees had experienced unkindness (incivility) in their workplaces,

leading to increased absenteeism, lower eﬀort, less collaboration, and

reduced enthusiasm for their organization. And incivility doesn’t just

mean extreme bullying. It includes everyday rudeness, gaslighting, or

# disrespect.

Even witnessing unkind behavior takes a toll. One study found that

when people saw rudeness among colleagues, their creativity and

decision-making suﬀered. Over time, teams that tolerate low-level

unkindness risk normalizing it, eroding group cohesion, psychological

safety, engagement, and retention. That breakdown of social capital

weakens the organization’s edge as a service provider and employer of

# choice.

Kindness changes the picture. When staﬀ feel noticed, valued, and

respected, they are more willing to help each other, collaborate, and

solve problems. The biggest predictors of retention aren’t money or

workload; they are social. What matters most is respect, inclusion,

pride in our work, and team relationships. Kindness supports all of

these.
