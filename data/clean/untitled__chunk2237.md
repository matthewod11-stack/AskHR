# 402 Forensic Psychology

and relevant to the case at hand. The Court stressed that the “overarching subject is the scientiﬁc validity” of the research in question rather than its general acceptance within the rele- vant scientiﬁc community. Thus, trial judges were assigned the role of gatekeeper, whose task is to decide, in effect, whether the proposed testimony represents methodologically sound research or is “junk science.”

In Kumho Tire v. Carmichael (1999), the Supreme Court reafﬁrmed this aspect of the Daubert decision, ruling that trial judges should be granted broad latitude in determining which factors are applied in assessing the reliability of a given expert’s testimony. The court also extended Rule 702 to include all expert testimony, whether it is “scientiﬁc,” “tech- nical,” or represents “other specialized knowledge.”

Because Daubert was a federal case rather than a state case, it has been left up to nonfederal jurisdictions whether to apply the Daubert standards or to retain the Frye test as the arbiter of admissibility. At present it is unclear what effect the Daubert decision will have on scientiﬁc psychological testi- mony or on clinical expert testimony. Regarding scientiﬁc testimony, it has been pointed out that, while the decision may open the door to innovative, valid new evidence that has not yet received widespread acceptance within the relevant scientiﬁc community, it also potentially opens the door for testimony based on questionable techniques that are unrecog- nized by the scientiﬁc community for good reasons, reasons that are not necessarily discernible by persons who are not trained in scientiﬁc methodology. Other observers have wor- ried about whether the decision may be used to exclude the testimony of clinical psychologists expressing opinions about speciﬁc issues, especially on such controversial foren- sic issues as predicting dangerousness, rape, trauma, the pres- ence of sex stereotyping, and child sexual abuse. Because interpretations of the Daubert standards have varied widely in the years since it was handed down, the question of its eventual impact remains open (Grove & Barden, 1999; Mark, 1999; Shuman & Sales, 1999).
