## models and then, more importantly, at the research on life satisfaction.

Ask yourself: Who conducts their personal and professional life in a

way I admire? Maybe it is a coworker caring for his bedridden parent,

the mother of three at your kids’ school who also manages payroll for

a Fortune 500 company, or your religious leader who lives his purpose.

Ask yourself what makes them admirable, and what choices they would

make if they were in your shoes.

Now consider what scientiﬁc studies tell us about life satisfaction —

not anecdotally but across large populations. We already mentioned

the Harvard and Asia studies. One of the largest studies worldwide

on life satisfaction is the German Socio-Economic Panel survey, which

covered almost 100,000 people from 1984 to 2019, gathering more than

700,000 completed responses. It found that signiﬁcant others, children,

friends, sports, spirituality, community involvement, salaries, savings,

and nutrition all contribute to life satisfaction. Not surprisingly, health

problems have a very negative impact, and you can ﬁnd an optimum

amount of time to spend on leisure and sleep.
