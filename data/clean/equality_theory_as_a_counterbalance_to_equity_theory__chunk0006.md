the meaning of distributive equality—as it exists in the relatively delimited literature on the subject—has been inadequately, and quite poorly, speciﬁed.

Thus, this paper offers a more fully speciﬁed deﬁnition of equality vis a vis its role as a base of distributive justice in organizations. Prior treatments take a rather narrow, ultimately an economic/utilitarian view of human inputs into work. That is, even when individuals are rewarded equally, there is an implicit assumption that they never- theless differ in terms of what they bring to the table rel- ative to adding value to organizations (how hard they work, level of skill or training, education, and so on). In contrast, through an exposition of the philosophical roots of equality principles emanating from Enlightenment philosophy, we herein reconceptualize equality to signify that all inputs are de facto equal. That is, one’s existential membership in a society, an organization, or group ultimately comprises one vital root conceptualization for distributive equality.

Beyond this, the paper outlines how distributive equality based on existential membership might actually be prac- ticed within organizations. Here we critically examine how a number of existing organizational practices represent heretofore unexamined instances of distributive equality. Third and ﬁnally, we explore the ethical dimensions of distributive equality, and organizational responsibilities for engaging in such distributive practices in today’s global environment. The overarching goal of this paper is to inﬂuence human resource management (HRM) discourse, which is ultimately thought to be a key inﬂuence of values and practices in the workplace (Jacques 1999).

To contextualize the overall thrust of this paper, the reconceptualization presented herein—that members’ very existence as human beings may privilege them, to a degree, to receive equivalent (or less unequal) outcomes—consti- tutes quite a radical departure from prior treatments of distributive equality. This recentering and reengagement of the concept of distributive justice, and of how work orga- nizations might better practice and implement justice, is especially timely given world events today. Consider that, as a society, we have become ever more efﬁcient at pro- ducing things—all the material goods and resources that we need to sustain us in life. And yet paradoxically, the more we are productive, the more the good life seems to continually elude our grasp. For example, while millions remain unemployed, enduring an enforced and stressful ‘‘leisure,’’ at the same time those who are employed ﬁnd themselves working longer hours than ever (Schor 1993, 2010), and indeed yearning for greater leisure time.

In fact, many of the paradoxes of our age relate to inequalities of distribution. For example, there are today approximately 18.5 million vacant homes in the US, while at the same time there are 3.5 million homeless (National Coalition for the Homeless 2009). Moreover, witness the
