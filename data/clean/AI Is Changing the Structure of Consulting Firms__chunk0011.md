research on traditional firms confirms that AI tools canperform many of the tasks that once occupied large teams ofjunior consultants, often with gains in speed and quality, therelative newness of the obelisk model means long-term evidenceis still to emerge. However, we believe that, if foundational taskscan be automated or accelerated, then smaller, more senior-heavyteams can focus more on the areas where human expertise createsthe most value.

Despite the forces causing this shift, many traditional consultingfirms will struggle to make the leap. As Clayton Christensenexplains in
