# 4.4. Stress

had particular international signiﬁcance with studies conducted in the US (Shader et al., 2001), Singapore (Fang, 2001), Australia (Cowin, 2002) and Taiwan (Yin and Yang, 2002) reporting similar results. Methods used to measure stress were varied and included scales (Fang, 2001; Shader et al., 2001), written comments (Fletcher, 2001; Cowin, 2002) and meta-analysis (Yin and Yang, 2002).

Stress exerted the most substantial impact on turnover cognition (coefﬁcent standardised ¼ 0.351, po0:000) and turnover intention (coefﬁcient standardised ¼ 0.29, po0:001) of all variables measured in Fang’s (2001) study. Whilst reporting that stress explained 8.5% from a total of 41% of the variance for turnover cognition and 4.6% from a total of 32% for turnover, the speciﬁc causes of stress remained undifferentiated. This detracts from the wider focus of the study, which was to identify the most critical causes of the turnover problem in Singapore with a view to mitigating the problem. Whilst an indication that stress is a major cause is helpful for directing future research, a scale identifying speciﬁc stressors would have been helpful in ascertaining areas requiring improvement.

Shader et al’s (2001) US study partly identiﬁed particular stressors via the Job Stress Scale (Hinshaw and Atwood, 1985), a 22-item, 4-point Likert with four subscales. The mean job stress score was 2.06 (SD ¼ 0.39, range 1–4), demonstrating that nurses (n ¼ 151, levels of reported moderate RR ¼ 63%). The Anticipated Turnover Scale consisting of 12 items rated on a 5-point Likert measure (possible responses undisclosed) reﬂected individual perceptions about the possibility of leaving their current positions (mean score of 3.45, SD ¼ 1.06, range 1–7), rating their intention to leave as moderate. Pearson’s correlation analyses were performed on all major study variables. The main stressor was assessed to be lack of stability in the work schedule (constantly changing rota), with the more stable the schedule, the less work-related stress (r ¼ (cid:3)0:205, po0:001) and lower anticipated turnover (r ¼ (cid:3)0:29, po0:001). Higher job stress was also found to lower job satisfaction through the lowering of group cohesion (r ¼ (cid:3)0:41, po0:001) which then increased anticipated turnover (r ¼ 0:37, po0:001). A stepwise regression model including the variables of job satisfac- tion ((cid:3)0.35), weekend overtime (0.27), job stress (0.16) and group cohesion ((cid:3)0.13) explained 31% of the variance in anticipated turnover. Shader et al. investi- gated turnover further by looking at different age groups in relation to these factors. The ﬁndings indicated that low job satisfaction and job stress were signiﬁcant predictors of anticipated turnover for 20–30-year-old nurses (R2 ¼ 16, po0:001), low job satisfaction was a (R2 ¼ 0:31, predictor po0:001) and low job satisfaction together with low group cohesion for 41–50-year-old nurses (R2 ¼ 0:28,
