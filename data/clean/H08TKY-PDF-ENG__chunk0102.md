## Multibusiness strategy: Enterprises that own multiple businesses often

have a ﬂawed approach to strategy: They focus too much on the makeup

of their portfolios and too little on enhancing the businesses in them.

To address this, start by recognizing that strategies for adding value to a

corporation’s businesses fall on a continuum. At one end the businesses

in the portfolio are completely unrelated; at the other they have many

similarities. Each location on the continuum requires a diﬀerent kind of

organizational structure and speciﬁc management processes to support

it. To succeed at execution, you need to determine where on the

spectrum your business falls and then align your portfolio selection,

structure, and processes with your vision of how to add value.
