## Chapter 10 • Reward Systems and Legal Issues

may set goals that are easily attainable so that performance ratings will lead to the highest possible level of reward. In other words, when managers are not held accountable, rewards may become the driver for the performance evaluation instead of the performance evaluation being the driver for the rewards.

- There exists extrinsic motivation at the expense of intrinsic motivation. What happens when there is so much, almost exclusive, emphasis on rewards? Employees may start to lose interest in their jobs, which, in turn, can decrease motivation. In some cases, the extrinsic value of doing one’s job (i.e., rewards) can supersede the intrinsic value (i.e., doing the work because it is interesting and challenging). Sole emphasis on rewards can lead to ignoring the fact that employee motivation can be achieved not only by providing rewards but also by creating a more challenging, more interesting work environment in which employees have control over what they do and how they do it.

- Rewards for executives are disproportionately large compared to rewards for everyone else. In many organizations, executive rewards are disproportionately large compared to the rewards received by everyone else in the organization. A study conducted by Pearl Meyer & Partners in 2004 revealed that the average compensation received by CEOs in major U.S. corporations was US $9.84 million, compared to an average compensation for employees in nonsupervisory roles of $27,485. The compensation for these CEOs was more than 360 times that of their employees! Such a large difference, particularly when the performance of the organization is not stellar, can lead to serious morale problems. CEOs should be compensated according to their performance, and an important indicator of CEO performance is overall firm performance (e.g., stock price in the case of publicly traded organizations).

Table 10.1 summarizes reasons for the failure of CP plans. Consider two examples of situations in which CP plans failed because of one or more of the reasons listed in this table. First, consider what happened at Green Giant, which is part of the General Mills global food conglomerate which includes such brands as Betty Crocker, Wheaties, and Bisquick. Green Giant implemented a bonus plan that rewarded employees for removing insects from vegetables. What was the result regarding performance? Initially, managers were pleased because employees were finding and removing a substantially higher number of insects. The initial enthusiasm disappeared, however, when managers found out that employees were bringing insects from home, putting them into vegetables, and removing them to get the bonus! A second example comes
