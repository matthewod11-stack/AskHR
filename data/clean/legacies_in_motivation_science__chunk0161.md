# Induction

The goal setting theory appears to be unique among work motivation theories in withstand- ing the test of time—some 50 years since the ﬁrst goal-setting experiments were conducted and 28 years since the ﬁrst statement of the theory. It has been rated as the most valid and theory of work motivation (Lee & practical Earley, 1992; Miner, 2003; Pinder, 1998). We attribute this success to the use of the inductive method.

Induction goes against what has become all but an axiom in psychology: Deduce a theory and then test it. When an experimental hy- pothesis is supported, theory building often is considered closed. Induction, on the other hand, helps prevent premature theorizing and premature closure. Induction minimizes the temptation for harking, namely formulating hypotheses after the results are known. Induc- tion lengthens the time perspective for theory development. Most importantly, once a theory is formulated inductively, the theory is open to further development; The theory continues to be a work in progress rather than a closed system. New studies are not a threat to the theory; rather, they are an opportunity for further development. In sum, induction helps prevent premature theorizing, premature clo- sure, and desperate attempts to prove one is not wrong.

Following the publication of our 1990 book, goal-setting research exploded to more than 1,000 studies (Latham, 2012; Mitchell & Daniels, 2003). Thus, we decided that an up- date to the theory was needed. There were more studies than we could keep track of so our new, edited book involves some 70 schol- ars who updated the literature (Locke & Latham, 2013). Below are examples.
