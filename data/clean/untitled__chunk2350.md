# Organizational Development

Although founded in 1892, the APA had a small, predomi- nantly doctoral level, membership, and avoided for several decades involvement in professional and applied psychology. Few school psychologists belonged to the APA, but per- haps some belonged to the National Education Association founded in 1870 (which added a section on child study in 1894). Of the 100 to 200 practitioners who provided psycho- logical services in school settings during this period, most held no national membership, and few if any state-level or local organizations represented their interests. The American Association of Clinical Psychologists (AACP) was formed in 1917 to serve the interests of clinicians in various settings, but it was short-lived, disbanding in 1919 to become the clinical section of the APA, the Ô¨Årst APA division.
