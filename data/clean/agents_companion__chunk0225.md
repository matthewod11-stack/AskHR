# Contract Negotiation

One core hypothesis behind contracts in the context of automation agents specifically is that

many tasks in the enterprise world can draw significant benefit from leveraging the power of

LLMs when used in a less-constrained manner (latency and cost wise).

Being able to tackle more and more complex tasks and making it possible for customers to

be able to rely on and trust the results of contractors will ensure real value for companies.

Even that being said, we need to have a notion of relative priority in order to make sure that

tasks are appropriately prioritized as well as resources fairly allocated. We thus introduce a

notion of cost (typically relative per customer or contract initiator) which can be discussed

and negotiated between the contract initiator and the contractor, in order to make sure that

the contract receives the adequate resources relative to the other contracts initiated by the

contract initiator. The contractors can also negotiate other aspects of the contracts, for

example in terms of specification and deliverables (cf. also section below on feedback).
