## HBR / The Big Idea / When Employees Take Sabbaticals, Organizations Benefit

Consider Carson’s experience. She had been working at a research

center focused on emerging-market poverty, leading partnerships

and innovation and seeing the center through a critical period of

formalization and growth. After ﬁve years in the job, she was feeling

undervalued in terms of her level of autonomy and pay. She and her ﬁancé had been fantasizing about taking a “monster” honeymoon. So,

she asked her bosses for ﬁve months oﬀ. To her surprise, they granted

the unpaid leave. She traveled through many of the countries her

organization studied during her leave, and it reminded her why she’d gotten into the work in the ﬁrst place. Her time away not only reaﬃrmed

her belief in the center’s mission but also gave her the conﬁdence to

consider taking her skills and experience elsewhere if necessary.

She came back reinvigorated, and she was pleased to learn that her

absence had caused the team to recognize the magnitude of her

contributions. Her bosses asked what they could do to keep her, and

she went from “feeling like a cog in a wheel,” in her words, to “feeling

like a grown-up with power.” She was promoted and, two years later,

became the executive director. The organization has thrived since her

return, doubling its budget and scope and quadrupling its number of staﬀ members and research aﬃliates.
