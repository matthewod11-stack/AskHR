## 36088 feedback and traditional top-down appraisal

Many academics and practitioners argue that the performance appraisal process has traditionally been viewed in a negative light in many organisations, even though it is a very important element of the overall performance process. Meyer (1991) maintains that most managers see performance appraisal as an ``onerous and distasteful'' chore that has to be carried out. Taylor et al. (1995) contend that performance appraisal is a practical challenge to all involved in the process and Lawler et al. (1984) argue that the performance appraisal interview is considered as an unpleasant activity for managers and supervisors which is either avoided or carried out in a hurried or perfunctory manner. They go on to suggest that managers dislike the performance appraisal process so much that, without administrative pressure to perform it, they will not carry out appraisals with subordinates at all.

Folger and Cropanzano (1998) outline the difficulties associated with negative feedback in the context of the performance appraisal interview. They argue that most managers dislike giving negative feedback and are not skilled in providing it. As a result, evaluations are often positively inflated. If this is the manner in which the interview is conducted, the effectiveness of the performance management process is significantly undermined. Meyer (1991) argues that, because of inaccurate performance feedback, employees may have a distorted view of their actual performance which will then be inconsistent with administrative decisions on issues such as salaries and promotions.
