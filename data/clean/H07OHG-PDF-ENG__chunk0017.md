the government. Employees receive coaching, advice, and support to

help them ﬁnd the training program that’s right for them, and the

training programs are paid for by the employer.

For example, in 2021, Target announced a tuition-assistance program

called “Dream to Be” in partnership with Guild, one of the leading

players in this growing space. According to Chief Diversity and Inclusion oﬃcer Kiera Fernandez, “Target has oﬀered a traditional

tuition reimbursement program for more than two decades. Now,

through our partnership with Guild to oﬀer Dream to Be, team members

can attend classes at more than 40 schools, colleges, and universities

… with no out-of-pocket tuition costs.” Fernandez said that as of April

2023, more than 25,000 employees have been approved for the program.

If designed eﬀectively, the beneﬁts of tuition assistance programs for employers are clear. For example, Jack Hartung, chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer

of fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle, told CNBC that “employees

who take advantage of the company’s free degrees are three and a

half times more likely to stay with the company and seven times more

likely to move up into management.” However, research suggests that

while 84% of employees value tuition reimbursement beneﬁts highly,

on average, only 2% of eligible employees use this beneﬁt. This implies

employers must do more to take advantage of this powerful tool.
