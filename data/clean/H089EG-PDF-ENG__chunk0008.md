# work through it.

- 1) Change your mindset.

Many people are promoted into management for doing their previous

job well. This means, as an individual contributor, you may have been

particularly strong at delivering results and completing the tasks on

your to-do list. But once you’re promoted to a leadership role, you must

accept that you can’t do everything on your own — nor should you.

Though it may seem counterintuitive, the more senior you become in

an organization, the less you’ll be involved in doing the day-to-day

work. You’ll need to have a sense of what’s happening without directly

contributing to every project.

This shift, from “doing” to “managing” can feel uncomfortable —

especially if you’re used to getting recognition for carrying out tasks

quickly and well. The reality is, your job has changed now, and how your

performance is measured will change along with it.
