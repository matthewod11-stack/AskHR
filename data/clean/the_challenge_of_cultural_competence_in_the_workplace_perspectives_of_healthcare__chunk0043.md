A dearth of respondents referred to broader, systemic components of cross-cultural care such as a recognition of racism (explicit imbalances, entrenched majority culture biases and the need for self-reflexivity (awareness of one’s own prejudices). Al- though a number of participants supported workplace diversity, this appeared to be in the course of improved communication with minority patients rather than advo- cating for diversity per se, or for cultural diversity at the executive, or ‘decision-making’ levels. As speculated earl- ier, cross-cultural education was perhaps viewed as an im- mediately applied or ‘hands on’ phenomenon rather than a holistic, structural approach. Prior research has found that clinicians have a preference for ‘active behavioural simulations’ as a cross-cultural training method [52].
