# Advocate for better public policy.

There’s a lot business can do in offering paid leave and supportive benefits and

culture, but the government plays a vital role as well. According to sociologist

Caitlyn Collins, the “free-market approach has failed families spectacularly.” In

particular, “Americans are among the most stressed-out people on the planet.”

Collins suggests four key areas where policy can help support caregivers’ basic

needs: paid leave to manage family health and well-being; quality, affordable early

childcare during work hours; fair work schedules to accommodate routine family

time; and living wages to meet basic material needs.
