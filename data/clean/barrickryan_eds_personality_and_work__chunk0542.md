## Personality as a Determinant of Moods and Work Attitudes

As Figure 6.1 illustrates, we hypothesize that personality traits indi- rectly inﬂuence the occurrence of counterproductive behaviors by shaping attitudes toward CWBs, as discussed in the previous section, and by shaping workplace emotions, work attitudes, and percep- tions of the work environment. Here we refer to attitudes toward work, in contrast with the previous focus on attitudes toward CWBs. In the discussion that follows, we examine the inﬂuence of person- ality traits on workplace moods and job attitudes speciﬁcally as rep- resentative features of the set of work attitudes, perceptions, and emotions in Figure 6.1.
