# The Theory of Reasoned Action

Attitudes are a summary evaluative judgment of a psychological ob- ject. The judgment is usually couched in dimensions such as good- bad, pleasant-unpleasant or likeable-unlikable (Ajzen, 2001; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). We focus here on Fishbein and Ajzen’s theory of reasoned action (1975), which is currently the most widely en- dorsed theory of attitude formation (Ajzen, 2001). According to the theory, our attitudes toward a behavior are the product of two things: our beliefs about the consequences of engaging in a given behavior and our evaluation of the desirability of the consequences of that behavior. These two elements are multiplied to obtain an individual’s overall attitude toward a behavior.

According to the theory of reasoned action, behavioral inten- tion is normally the best predictor of how a person will behave, and behavioral intentions are a weighted additive function of a person’s attitude toward the behavior (A) and his or her subjective norms (SN) about what others think he or she should do. The subjective norm element is composed of a normative belief about whether relevant individuals or groups think the individual should or should not perform the behavior and the individual’s motivation to comply with that individual or group.

The theory of reasoned action has been successfully used to predict the behavioral intention to commit a number of behaviors, including having an abortion, smoking marijuana, and choosing among political candidates (Beck & Ajzen, 1991). On rarer occa- sions, the theory has been applied to socially undesirable behav- iors, such as lying, cheating, and shoplifting (Beck & Ajzen, 1991). More recently, in his theory of planned behavior, Ajzen (1991) has argued that behavior is a function of both behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control, which refers to people’s per- ception of the ease or difﬁculty of performing a given behavior. While we acknowledge that there may be instances where per- ceived behavioral control can inﬂuence the occurrence of a CWB (theft or destruction of property), these instances would seem to
