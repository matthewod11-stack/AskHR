# CHRISTOPHER ROBERT AND WAN YAN

many synergies between culture theory and humor theory that suggest interesting research angles for the motivated researcher. This extension of humor research into the cross-cultural realm will have the effect of forcing humor researchers to describe their theories more carefully, and will also make research ﬁndings more applicable in organizations that are operating in an increasingly complex multicultural landscape. Indeed, we believe that researchers who are interested in humor have fertile ground in which to work.

In the remainder of this ﬁnal section, we focus a little bit more on practical research questions and research issues. In particular, we highlight what we feel are two potentially rich research areas in the domain of human resource management: humor and training, humor and recruitment/ selection. We then touch on some important methodological and theoretical issues that those who are interested in pursuing research on humor in organizations might consider.
