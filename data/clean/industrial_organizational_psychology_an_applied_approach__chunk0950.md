Bring copies of your résumé and leave one even if you are asked to complete a job application. Bring a pen. Many organizations automatically eliminate applicants who do not do this. Be nice to the receptionist or any other person with whom you come in contact. The organization’s first look at you is probably the most important, and you can be sure that word of a rude or poorly dressed applicant will quickly get back to the person making the actual hiring decision.
