# Understand the Complexity

CEO successions generally happen in one of three ways. Strategic

successions take place after a merger or an acquisition, when the CEO of

one of the companies becomes the leader of the combined entity. Forced

successions occur when the incumbent leaves abruptly because of health

or performance problems, and the new CEO takes over immediately.
