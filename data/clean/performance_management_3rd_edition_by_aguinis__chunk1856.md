## Part IV â€¢ Reward Systems, Legal Issues, and Team Performance Management

The general principles that we have discussed in this book thus far still apply. For example, we are still trying to design and implement the best possible system. Specifically, the system should have a strategic congruence and be thorough, practical, meaningful, reliable, acceptable, ethical, and so forth (see Section 1.6 in Chapter 1). In addition, a system that includes team performance should also consider the possible dangers of a poorly implemented system, such as the use of false or misleading information, wasting time and money, damaging relationships, and so on (see Section 1.3 in Chapter 1). Team performance, of course, adds a layer of complexity to any performance management system, but the fundamental principles that guide the design and implementation of the system discussed throughout this book remain the same.

It is important to note that some conditions are necessary for team performance

management to lead to improved team performance; for example:5

- The processes involved in the performance of the team are relatively uncon- strained by other requirements of the task or the organization. For example, the organization should not constrain the amount of effort and skill that the team members can invest in a particular team-based project. An example of a constraint may be individual and team goals that compete against each other.

- The team is designed well, and the organizational context supports team perform- ance. In other words, there are elements in the organization that support team performance (e.g., reward systems, training systems).

- Performance feedback focuses on team processes that are under the control of team members. There is no point in providing feedback on aspects of performance that are beyond the control of the team.
