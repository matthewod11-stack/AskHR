# The jargon jungle.

Organizational change often brings with it a wave of new terminologies.

While intended to streamline and deﬁne the transition, new terminology can sometimes have the opposite eﬀect. Instead of

facilitating clarity, these new terms can become barriers, muddying

understanding and creating divides among employees. Such disparities

in understanding can hinder collaboration and impede the very

progress these terms were meant to support.
