# The Economic Boon and the GI Bill

Buoyed by a positive mood stimulated by the Allied victory in World War II, the postwar economic boon and the GI bill brought affordable housing, jobs, and educational oppor- tunities to war veterans that were unprecedented in U.S. history (Chamberlain & Robinson, 1997; Glidewell, 1995; Greenberg, 1997; Kiester, 1994; Tuttle, 1993). The establish- ment of the GI bill in part reﬂected a national priority to increase educational opportunities for all citizens. This prior- itization and valuing of higher education was markedly in- creased in 1957 when the Russians defeated the United States in the race to launch an orbiting satellite into space. To help keep the United States competitive with the Soviet Union, policy makers supported education, science, and technology more then ever (Chomsky, 1997).

With the beneﬁts provided by the GI bill, a generation of over seven million returning war veterans, some of whom were aspiring social scientists, were able to enter their chosen profession as a result of tuition-free education, stipends, and home loans provided by the GI bill (Greenberg, 1997). These opportunities for a college education contributed to the major growth of the professions, including the social sciences. Many war veterans pursued graduate education, and for those who obtained their PhD degrees, faculty positions were often available because of the postwar economic boon and popular demand for higher education. However, along with these very positive national emphases on education and scientiﬁc discovery, the nation was struggling with signiﬁcant social turmoil.
