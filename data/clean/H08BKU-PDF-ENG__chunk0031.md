# industries like technology.

Reach out to industry peers.

Beyond direct contact with NGOs, employers can learn from their

peers. Many companies have shared their ﬁrsthand experience of

refugee recruitment. IKEA’s ﬂagship Skills for Employment initiative

has provided upskilling and employment opportunities to hundreds

of people from a refugee background. The multinational corporation

is committed to sharing its inclusive recruitment model with other

corporations that are keen to take action. Reaching out to industry

peers is a great way to learn about speciﬁc considerations and best

practices while establishing your own path to inclusive recruitment.
