When some men were informed in an experiment of their peers’ support

for ﬂexible working, their intentions to take between ﬁve and eight

weeks of parental leave increased by 62%, or nearly 13 percentage

points, compared to men who did not receive the information.

Correcting inaccurate beliefs through information helped many men to

behave more in line with their personal values and preferences. Because

humans have an innate drive to ﬁt in and go with the herd, correcting

inaccurate beliefs in this way is a potent lever for changing behavior and

keeping ﬂawed norms from taking hold.
