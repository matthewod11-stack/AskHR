# (Empirical Data)

information synthesis and retrieval research might serve as the foundation for our evaluation of the literature.

From July 4 through July 9, 2022, the databases Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and SAGE Journals were searched for studies. Figure 1 depicts the overall number of articles retrieved, the number of sur- viving articles after deleting duplicates, the number of articles that did not fulfill the inclusion criteria, and the articles chosen for further investigation. There were ini- tially 698 papers. Using the search parameters across all four databases, 271 articles were retained after deleting all the duplicates. In the initial screening phase, 220 titles were eliminated after each paper’s title and abstract were assessed for relevancy. The eligibility of the studies’ full texts was then evaluated in accordance with their metho- dology and conclusions. After reading the entire article, several manuscripts were rejected for a variety of rea- sons. Among those that were deleted were manuscripts that did not define the phrase ‘‘workplace culture,’’ manuscripts that were reviews of secondary sources, and papers that just quantified the link. Finally, 19 manu- scripts were included and deemed to be eligible for study. Figure 1 depicts the PRISMA flow diagram.
