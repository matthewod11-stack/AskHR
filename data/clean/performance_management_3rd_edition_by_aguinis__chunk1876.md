## Performance Management Challenges in Expatriate Teams

The globalization of business has led many organizations to move from a traditional individual expatriate assignment (i.e., sending an individual manager overseas) to a team-based assignment, whereby several individuals are assigned—together—to a foreign location. Service firms rely on this strategy frequently because it is difficult to separate service “production” from service consump- tion. In other words, the nature of many services is such that it is needed for an entire team to work closely with a client to understand their needs. This was precisely the situation faced by a multina- tional aerospace firm based in North America. A total of 17 expatriate teams originating from seven different countries from around the globe were assigned to the aerospace company’s location to work together on the design of a new product. What types of challenges do such teams face in terms of implementing performance management? Moreover, what additional challenges exist when such expatriate teams include members who themselves are from different countries? The most important challenge is that each team will have to perform based on standards and expecta- tions of its home country. However, expatriate teams must be concerned with three different stakeholders: the local client, the home company, and the other on-site teams. Thus, it is important that performance be measured in relationship to these three stakeholders groups. In other words, performance management of expatriate teams must include a multi-stakeholder perspective.8

34% participated in systems that included both individual and team components, and about 25% of respondents participated in systems that included a team component only. The remainder of this chapter discusses how to include a team component in a performance management system. In doing so, we consider how organizations can address each of these questions.
