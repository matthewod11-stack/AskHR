# % Promoters - % Detractors = eNPS

The remainder of the survey is questions related to satisfaction, engagement, and

wellbeing of employees, which are evaluated on scale from 1 “strongly disagree” up

to 5 “strongly agree” or 1 “not satisfied” to 5 “strongly satisfied”. Note that score(s) are

converted to a scale of 1-100 (as illustrated below) for easier comparison (fig. 17)

where the answer of 1 (“not at all” or “strongly disagree”) represents 1 point and the

answer 5 (“completely happy” or “strongly agree”) represents 100 points. The total

score in different areas of employee experience is measured as their average score

from questions related to the employee experience area.
