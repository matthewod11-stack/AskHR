what they are closely obligated. For these reasons, having this dimension would not do something necessarily good to the organization.

Different from two anterior focuses, the normative bond is constituted in a conjunct of thought, obligations and moral duties to the organization. These sentiments are also accompanied or covered with others, like guilty, uncomfortableness, apprehension and preoccupation when the employee think or plan to leave the organization (Siqueira, 2001). The normative commitment also appears with a result under the average (2.5). To Rego et al. (2005), there are reasons to infer that the organizations have interest to promote affective and normative bonds for its colaborators and to reduce the instrumental bond strength.

Job satisfaction level sought to identify the level of responders. It was used as the resumed scale of Siqueira (2008), according to which, in the results of the analysis, the higher the average score, the higher will be the level of contentment or satisfaction of the employee with that dimension of his job. Therefore, by calculating the averages in relation to the proportion of scores, averages over 3.57 tend to indicate satisfaction. Averages equal or lower than 2.78 tend to signalize dissatisfaction, and values between these cited averages inform an indifferent state, i.e., nor satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

Through generated results about job satisfaction dimensions, it is noticed by data exposed in Table IV that the satisfaction with colleagues, with average of 4.15 was considered the dimension of more satisfaction and with a considerable intensity. The percent of satisfied employees with job colleagues (89 percent) corroborates with these findings.

Following, thedimension Satisfaction with thebosses,with average of4.06, alsoindicates a high level of dissatisfaction. The percent of responders who show satisfaction with bosses is 85 percent. It may be highlighted, then, that dimensions related to interpersonal relationship and to convivence with organization people were better evaluated.

In the sequence, the satisfaction with the nature of the job presented average of 3.74, being considered also positive and 70 percent of individual demonstrated to be satisfied with the nature of the job.

The averages of satisfaction with salary (2.58) and satisfaction with promotions (2.47) are under the average, although the considerable standard deviation (0.92 and 0.88, respectively). These data suggest that the individuals dissatisfied with their remuneration or salary politics were adopted by the organization. In percentage terms, 59 percent of responders consider themselves dissatisfied with the salary and 66 percent consider themselves dissatisfied with the promotions.

In a general way, considering the averages of all scores, the results indicate that 56 percent of responders present a state of indifference (nor satisfied or dissatisfied), 34 percent consider themselves satisfied and only 10 percent consider themselves satisfied. The highlights in percent of each indicator are marked in Table IV.

Turnover intention was identified as the perception of the employees of the Institute in relation to such indicator. Table V presents the results of the research. The variable had a
