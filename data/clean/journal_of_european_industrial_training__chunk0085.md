evaluation The use of 3608 feedback is increasing in organisations, primarily as a tool to enhance employee self-awareness in the context of employee career development. It can be used as input in decision making about performance; however, this is not popular in practice. There is a consensus that 3608 feedback is more appropriate in a developmental context. The literature highlights significant problems with the approach in the context of performance assessments that are related to pay and bonus issues. Maurer and Tarulli (1996), for example, draw an interesting analogy between the role that weighing scales play in a diet programme and the feedback element of the 3608 feedback process. ``The most important part of the diet is the actions taken once the dieter steps off of the weighing scales. The scale itself is only useful in the context of a larger programme. Within that context the scale is viewed as a useful tool'' (Maurer and Tarulli, 1996, p. 235). The 3608 feedback process represents an initial stage in the career development process whereby feedback recipients enhance their self- awareness and thus can more specifically address their developmental needs. The payback to individuals and

organisations who utilise 3608 feedback processes for development purposes can be considerable. Specific benefits include a greater awareness and relevance of competencies, investing in training and development initiatives that reinforce the desired competencies of the organisation and the identification of key development issues for individuals, departments and for the organisation as a whole. Effective feedback processes may result in a more rounded concept of development that embraces organisational dimensions, self-development and the development of the individual's career.

This monograph considered the findings which emerge from the numerous contemporary studies investigating various aspects of 3608 feedback. While it is a priority research area in the literature of late, a number of questions currently remain unanswered. Smither et al. (1995b) report that there was no significant difference in subsequent employee behaviour between individuals who received individual feedback reports and those who did not. They argue that the exposure to the valued behaviours may be enough to facilitate behaviour change. This finding was replicated by Reilly et al. (1996) and Dominick et al. (1997). However, Atwater et al. (1995) report that there was no improvement in the focal individuals' performance until they were provided with feedback reports and Atwater et al. (2000) report that providing individuals with written feedback does not predict an improvement in subsequent performance. On the other hand, Hegarty (1974), Atwater et al. (1995), Smither et al. (1995b) and Reilly et al. (1996) report an overall improvement in managerial performance as a result of subordinate appraisal. These contradictory findings raise concerns about the actual impact that individual feedback reports can have on subsequent recipient behaviour. The degree to which the recipients change their behaviour positively as a result of receiving the feedback acts as a litmus test for evaluating the effectiveness of the whole system. Further scrutiny of the impact that feedback provision has on employee behaviour is vital to establish the relationship between 3608 feedback interventions and subsequent recipient performance improvement.

Very few studies have sought to investigate the impact of 3608 feedback on issues such as ownership for self-development, involvement in career development, the extent of
