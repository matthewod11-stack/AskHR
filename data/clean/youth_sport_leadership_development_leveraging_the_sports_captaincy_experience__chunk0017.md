captains how to be effective leaders in sport and to thereby improve the quality of high school athletics. By providing leadership training opportuni- ties in sport, it is our hope that youth will learn lessons that will equip them for other leadership opportunities later in their lives. In its present form, the program is comprised of two parts: (a) a one-day in-person clinic; and (b) a self-study captain’s guide (available upon request from the ﬁrst author).
