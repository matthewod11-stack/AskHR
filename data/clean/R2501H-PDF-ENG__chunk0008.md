# Custodians

Custodians see learning as instrumental to executing an organization’s

strategy and strengthening its culture. In their view learning is a tool

to help employees perform their roles better (and get better roles).

While learning helps employees succeed and advance, the ultimate

beneﬁciary is the organization, and any learning that doesn’t provide

a concrete advantage to the company is probably useless.

Custodians embrace this view because they see themselves primarily as

stewards of the business. For them, alignment with senior leadership is

a top priority; they create value by bringing others on board with the

top team’s agenda. Indeed, many custodians we spoke to were business

leaders in other areas before they came to learning, and most noted how

much they had in common with their C-suite peers.
