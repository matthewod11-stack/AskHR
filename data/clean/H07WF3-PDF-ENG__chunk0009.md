Let’s start with steroids, the least desirable point on this spectrum.

Steroids elevate short-term performance but leave you worse oﬀ in the

long term. For example, imagine a student who is assigned homework

to read and critique a passage of text. The student could use a large

language model (LLM) as a steroid by simply dropping the text of the

passage into ChatGPT or any similar tool, prompting it to produce such

the student the ability to complete the assignment in an instant, in the

long term it defeats the purpose of the exercise. Not only might the

student fail to learn from the assignment, but they might never acquire

(or slowly lose) the ability to critique a passage and articulate their

thoughts in clear writing. Just as with sports, taking shortcuts to achieve

a short-term goal can have negative consequences for other goals in the
