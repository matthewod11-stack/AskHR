# 3.2.4. Organisational performance

To build the performance factor, we used variables from Rutheford, Kuratko and Holt (2008)

and Molina, Claver, Pereira and Tarí (2009). The first variable is “What is the firm’s

profitability?”, with a weight of 0.895. The second is “What is the rate of return on assets?”,

which has a weight of 0.960. The third is “What is the profit margin?”, with a weight of 0.869.

The variance explained is 71.56, the value of the KMO test is 0.709, the Cronbach’s alpha is

α=0.814, and r=0.801.
