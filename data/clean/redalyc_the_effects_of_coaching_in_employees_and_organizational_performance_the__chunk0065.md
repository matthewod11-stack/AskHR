## 3.2.3. Individual performance of human resources

We used variables from Chand and Katou (2007) and Huselid, Becker and Beatty (2005) to

measure the individual performance of human resources: “The workers are committed to the

organisation”, with a weight of 0.755; “The workers achieve their individual objectives”, with a

weight of 0.912; and “The workers improve their efficiency”, with a weight of 0.884. The

variance explained is 52.341, and the value of the KMO test is 0.771. The reliability of this

scale is α=0.711, and r=0.725.
