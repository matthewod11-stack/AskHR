## use for the people on the other side of the mirror.

Another example was conveyed to us by Chris Mayer. In their study of loss-

aversion in housing, Genosove and Mayer (2001) found that the nominal purchase

price condominium owners in Boston, MA, had paid for their houses influenced

their listing prices and the prices at which they sold their houses. In talking about

his findings before some investment bankers, one person in the audience said he

knew about this effect, and that his firm had taken steps to limit it. His firm combats

loss-aversion by forcing a trader to periodically switch his “position” (the portfolio

of assets the trader bought and is blamed or credited for) with the position of another

trader in the firm. Switching ensures that traders do not make bad trades because of

loss-aversion and emotional attachment to their past actions without affecting the

firm’s net trading position. If attachment to one’s trading position is bad, the switch

creates a purely behavioral scope economy, which permits firms with many traders

to outcompete firms with fewer traders.

Deadlines are another kind of organizational repair. When people procrastinate,

methods for enforcing deadlines will help them get work done (O’ Donoghue and

Rabin 2001). If firms are able to enforce deadlines better than individuals can, the

firm has a cost advantage over individual workers who are self-employed. Deadline

10 percent of people who can will end up in jobs where it’s required’—such as dealing blackjack,

Becker’s example, or managing mutual funds.” (Actually, blackjack dealers’ strategies are completely

constrained by casino rules and therefore require no skill at probability judgment.)
