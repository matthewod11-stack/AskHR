# CHAPTER SEVEN

enforcement can come in the hard form of firing threats, or in the soft form of feeling

bad about letting coworkers down, or the in-between form of risking coworkers’

wrath if a missed deadline on a joint project leads to mistaken blame.

While we are lacking convincing field data on organizational repairs, these exam-

ples suggest the following recipe for studying them. Find a mistake most people make

in individual decisions; ask what organizational practice would limit its effect; then

investigate whether the practice works. (Ideally, convince a firm to randomly vary the

organizational design across similar departments!) Or reverse engineer the recipe:

think of a curious organizational practice; ask what economic (Gibbons 2004b) or

behavioral problem in individual choice it might be a solution to.

Repairs can also come from the market rather than from an organizational practice.

Commenting on the slow speed of industry consolidation, Jensen (1993, pp. 847)

wrote:

In industry after industry with excess capacity, managers fail to recognize that they

themselves must downsize; instead they leave the exit to others while they continue

to invest.

The reluctance to downsize might stem from emotional reluctance of executives to fire people (though self-interest surely plays a role), An aversion to firings and

layoffs is an organizational manifestation of loss-aversion. For most managers this

is a kind of effort in the simple agency model sketched above—an activity which

they dislike doing but which is good for shareholders.

One solution to the problem of necessary downsizing is sorting—hire managers

who do not find firing people effortful (like “Chainsaw Al” Dunlop and “Neutron

Jack” Welch). Jensen suggested that the emergence of the leveraged buyout (LBO)

organizational form has been a useful mechanism for downsizing (and other changes

in governance would help too). An important feature of the LBO is that control shifts

to new investors (the LBO partnership), who typically have no emotional attachment

to the firm’s workers. This element of psychological transfer, and willingness to

accept a “loss” from the firm’s previous policy, may be central to the success of this

kind of restructuring. Of course, the LBO form also offers huge financial incentives

to restructure, and to do so rapidly (because of the large debt service burdens). But

maybe these large rewards just reflect how emotionally painful downsizing is for
