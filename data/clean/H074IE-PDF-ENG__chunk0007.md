Dan, a client I coached through a career transition, started working

with me after being laid off. Prior to being let go, Dan’s company

had put him on a performance improvement plan, or “PIP,” as it’s

euphemistically called in HR. Although he was aware that he had areas

to work on, Dan thought his job was safe and that he’d have a longer

timeframe to better his performance. He thus found himself totally

blindsided when he was fired.
