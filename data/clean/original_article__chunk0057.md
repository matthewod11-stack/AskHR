# Hypothesis

6: Team interaction quality (TIQ) mediates the relationship between cultural intelligence quotient (CQ) and proﬁtability.

Measuring TP is important because ‘teams with a strong belief in their capabilities set higher goals, develop strategies to achieve their goals, and persist in the face of setbacks’ (Collins and Parker, 2010). Groups with high levels of potency are more likely to achieve success in team goals. Given the ultimate goal of the board is to represent the interests of the shareholders by guiding the organization to ﬁnancial success, for our study we selected relative proﬁtability performance as the indicator of corporate suc- cess, and therefore board success. We hypothe- size the following relationship:

Hypothesis 7: Team potency (TP) mediates the relationship between team interaction quality (TIQ) and proﬁtability.

The literature of late is rife with references to the relationship between TTP and ﬁnancial performance, and organizations are ‘increas- ingly focusing on teams to increase competitive advantage’ (Hartenian, 2002). Teams have become the focus of businesses interested in improving their productivity and proﬁtability, as collaboration, continuous learning and shared to information have been shown to access generate value in organizations by improving increasing productivity, enhancing creativity,

Hypothesis 8a: Team task performance (TTP) mediates the relationship between team interaction quality (TIQ) and proﬁtability.

Hypothesis 8b: Team task performance (TTP) mediates the relationship between cultural intelligence quotient (CQ) and proﬁtability.

These hypotheses and the results are repre- sented in Figure 2. Note that consistent with the F&M model we have distinguished the four levels of focus – board characteristics, board processes, board-level outcomes and ﬁrm-level outcomes.

RESEARCH DESIGN To understand the inﬂuence of the identiﬁed factors on relative proﬁtability performance of public and private for-proﬁt organizations, we conducted a quantitative study using a combi- nation of survey data, proprietary data from third-party sources and public domain informa- tion. We followed a strict psychometric survey methodology that gathered individual responses addressing selected constructs. By using a blended quantitative approach using multiple sources of data, we reduced the potentially high level of method and social desirability bias in this study. The following section describes the method we used for the develop- ment of our survey instrument (including oper- ationalization) and data collection for our study. A summary of the constructs operationalized in
