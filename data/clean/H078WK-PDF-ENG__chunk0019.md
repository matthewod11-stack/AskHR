## “I want to position Uncle Nearest with Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, and

Johnnie Walker, brands that have sustained for 150 years. You cannot do

that by limiting your diversity.”

To be clear, Weaver would seek demographic diversity on her team; she

was not foregoing that part of her DEI journey. She was only saying that

she was not interested in that alone. Diversity of thought, which would

come from multiple types of people, and often unexpected people,

would be what would make Uncle Nearest a brand beyond its diverse

roots, competing with august incumbents.

Her success in cultivating diversity and diversity of thought comes from

largely avoiding four DEI pitfalls many companies fall into.
