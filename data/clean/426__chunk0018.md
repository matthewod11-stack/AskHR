comfort with diversity, structural gaps, and organizational attractiveness have been reported (Balkundi et al., 2007; Ely, 2004; Hobman & Bordia, 2006; Leonard et al., 2004; Martins & Parsons, 2007). Past analyses of gender diversity literature have shown inconsistent results on gender and performance (Jackson et al., 2003; Mulcahy & Linehan, 2014). Pay discrimination and inequality are also key topics in gender diversity literature while the gender wage gap is shrinking (Blau & Kahn, 2006), yet it is still significant. Not as much is known about other underprivileged groups or workers who fall into various vulnerable categories (Brynin & GÃ¼veli, 2012).

The effects of orientation training on gender socialization are little understood. Gender differences in labor market attachment, work-life conflict, and workplace values may moderate employee orientation, work satisfaction, and job outcomes (Lange, 2008; Lefkowitz, 1994). Despite several studies on gender issues and company performance, the advantages of women directors in corporate governance remain obscure (Dobbin & Jung, 2011). Women on corporate boards and gender as a component of diversity might benefit from a deeper understanding of the relationships between social actors and structures. Additionally, research should investigate the successful leadership of mixed-gender groups and the contextual elements that prevent stereotyping in such settings.

Age Diversity Age diversity is endorsed by the social categorization, social identity, and similarity attraction theories, which assert that age variety has an inconsistent impact on organizational results. However, an overview of the research on age and work reveals that the predominant theoretical focus is on negative forecasts. The conclusion drawn from these studies is that older employees are more likely to be subjected to age discrimination or, at the very least, unfair treatment. Specifically, the assumption seems to hold that younger employees are given preference when it comes to making decisions such as performance ratings, hiring, and salary decisions over those who are older (Shore et al., 2009).

Furthermore, the majority of stereotypes about older workers have been negative, including the belief that they are less adaptable, innovative, and productive, harder to train, and more resistant to change (Burke et al., 2013; Kulik et al., 2000; Ringenbach & Jacobs, 1995) and less comfortable with technology.

While age is not generally associated with lower performance ratings, there is evidence that employees who are older than the age norm for their career stage or older than their work group or direct supervisor experience poorer performance evaluations, less possibilities for training and career progression, and worse performance ratings Employees who are older than their direct supervisor may experience less opportunities for training and career progression and worse performance ratings. While age is not typically associated with lower performance ratings, there is evidence that older employees experience poorer opportunities for promotion and training (Cleveland & Shore, 1992; Maurer & Rafuse, 2001). In general, studies on age diversity are significantly less established than research on other aspects of diversity and have been undertaken mostly in Western environments (Joshi & Roh, 2007), indicating the need for in a range of work contexts alternative (Theodorakopoulos & Budhwar, 2015).
