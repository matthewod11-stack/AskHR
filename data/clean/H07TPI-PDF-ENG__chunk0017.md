## direct and assertive like their male manager counterparts.

The problem from the women managers’ perspective was that the

ﬂexible work policy would make the style they had developed diﬃcult to

maintain. While video calls were an option, managers did not view them

as an easy or natural way to spark interaction. Others pointed out that with their subordinates working diﬀerent schedules with varied hours,

this meant that they needed to be available at a broader range of hours

as well if they were to remain available and helpful to their workers. Not

only would this be diﬃcult for anyone to do, it also threatened to make

women managers’ own work-life conﬂict much worse because it made it

hard for them to have time with their own families.
