# Competency Benchmarks and Questions

The final step in the MOSAIC approach in- volves the development of benchmarks, or mastery levels, for competencies. An individual can be evaluated by comparing his/her mas- tery of a competency to the benchmark levels (see Table III). Similarly, successful perform- ance in a position requires that an individual demonstrate mastery of the competency at a specific benchmark level. Although the occu- pational studies do not ask for levels of com- petencies, competency benchmark levels are important for many HR practices, such as per- formance management. Benchmark levels pro- vide a standard way to define mastery of the competencies for an individual or position. Each competency benchmark consists of level definitions (i.e., the general statement of level) and behavioral examples (i.e., actual job be- haviors). The definitions provide a standard that is not changed, while the examples can be modified and made job specific.

Benchmark levels provide a standard way to define mastery of the competencies for an individual or position.
