# LEARNING AND MEMORY 53

The great questions of philosophy, the mind–body problem and the nature of knowledge, were also the questions that drove early developments in the pathways to modern psy- chology. This is especially true of biological or physiological psychology. Wilhelm Wundt, who founded experimental psy- chology, titled his major work Foundations of Physiological Psychology (1874/1908). William James, the other major ﬁg- ure in the development of modern psychology, devoted a third of his inﬂuential text Principles of Psychology (1890) to the brain and nervous system. Both Wundt and James studied medicine and philosophy, and both considered themselves physiologists. Their goal was not to reduce psychology to physiology but rather to apply the scientiﬁc methods of phys- iology to the study of the mind. The other driving force in early biological psychology was the study of the brain and nervous system.

The major topics in modern biological psychology are sen- soryprocesses,learningandmemory,motivationandemotion, and most recently cognition—in short, behavioral and cogni- tive neuroscience. A number of other areas began as part of physiological psychology and have spun off to become ﬁelds in their own right. We treat the major topics in biological psy- chology separately in the text that follows. But ﬁrst we sketch very brieﬂy the recent philosophical and physiological roots.
