You may not have “marketing” or “sales” in your job title, but chances

are, you’re still in the pitching business. That’s because most jobs

require the ability to inﬂuence, persuade, and convince others. Whether

you’re presenting an alternate approach to your team project during the

morning scrum, lobbying for a promotion, or trying to convince your

neighbors to support your idea to turn your cul-de-sac into a pickleball
