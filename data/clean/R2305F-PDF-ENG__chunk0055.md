# Getting Everyone in the Feedback Loop

Most recent research has focused on the beneﬁts of real-time feedback.

See the problem, correct the problem. That’s OK if you’re the

boss passing feedback on to your staﬀ. But if you’re younger and

less experienced (or working on any highly diverse team), stopping

colleagues in the hall to tell them how they could do their jobs better

is likely to put your teammates on the defensive, make you a bunch of

enemies, and maybe even stunt your career.

There is one mechanism that eﬀectively surfaces all the diverse

feedback learn-it-alls need to thrive. If you build regular loops for

feedback into collaborations, your team will recognize it not as a sign

of condescension or malevolence but as an integral part of the job. This

involves setting aside speciﬁc moments for mutual exchanges: I know

I’m expected to listen openly as you give me actionable feedback about

what you think I’ve done well and what I could do to improve. Then I

will do the same for you. Just like brushing our teeth, we do it regularly,

to keep team performance high.

In setting up any loop, you need to clarify how much positive versus

constructive feedback each teammate should supply. You can, for

example, have people structure their feedback as one thing they feel

that the other person is doing well and one thing the other person could

do to up his or her performance. Alternatively, you can use a “start, stop,

continue” structure, describing one thing to start doing, one thing to

stop doing, and one thing to continue.
