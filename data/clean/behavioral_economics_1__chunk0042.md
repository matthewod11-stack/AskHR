An important theoretical attack on market efficiency was showing that if investors have limited horizons

(due to quarterly evaluation of institutional portfolio managers, for example) then even if prices wander away

from fundamental values, investors might not have enough aggregative incentive to trade prices back to the

fundamentals, which allows mispricing to persist. (As Keynes, noted, markets might stay irrational longer than

you can stay liquid.14).

A central point here is that an attack on the proposition that prices would fully reveal information caused

the finance profession to carefully examine the microstructural and institutional reasons why such revelation

might, or might not occur. So the behavioral critique, whether right or wrong, did lead to a sharper focus on

institutional details, which eventually led to better financial economics.

A recent trend is extending some of these ideas to corporate finance— how companies raise and spend

stronger here than in asset pricing because large decisions are made by individuals or small groups, and

discipline is only exerted by boards of directors, career concerns, sorting for talented decision makers, and so
