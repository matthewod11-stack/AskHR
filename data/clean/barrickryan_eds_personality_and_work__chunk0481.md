these information processing outcomes that is totally consistent with the process logic we have been arguing for. They ﬁrst lay out the stages linking immediate mood states with judgments and pro- cessing outcomes. Working from the “affect as information” ap- proach, they propose the key stages of reaction, attention (to affective states or reactions), and attribution (for affective states or reactions). They then propose a classiﬁcation of individual differ- ence measures relevant to these stages and organize relevant ex- isting trait measures into their classiﬁcatory scheme. The program has the virtue of tying personality directly to process and the added advantage of using personality moderator predictions as a way of testing the validity of process.
