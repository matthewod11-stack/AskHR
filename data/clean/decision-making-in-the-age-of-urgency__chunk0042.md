Big-bet decisions: Increase quality of interactions during decision making by exploring alternatives, challenging initial hypotheses, and appointing a devil’s advocate to present counterarguments.

Cross-cutting decisions: Focus on process and coordination of decision meetings to encourage collaboration among individuals and avoid silos.

Delegated decisions: Empower employees to make decisions by creating a strong sense of ownership and accountability and encouraging a greater inclination toward action.

is made, who is involved (and when), and how dialogues and discussions occur is a key success factor. But what does a good process look like? The companies that excel at making cross- cutting decisions emphasize effective coordination among different stakeholders. They are also focused on critical issues— for example, that committees spend their time and resources on the decisions that are most important to the business. When these practices are followed, organizations are 4.5 times more likely to be a winner.

key ingredients for empowerment are giving people a strong sense of ownership and accountability for the decisions in which they’re involved, as well as fostering a bias for action— especially when people are making time- sensitive decisions.

These practices are far more important to decision-making success, the data suggest, than establishing clear roles or processes or giving guidelines for when to escalate a deci- sion for approval.

By contrast, the results show that having only clearly defined roles, accountability, or decision rights is not sufficient to win.
