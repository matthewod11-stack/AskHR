## HBR / Digital Article / The Best Leaders Encourage “Spacious Thinking”

Bring in novelty. We often meet in the same places, follow the same

agendas with the same people, and assume that the same process can

meet any number of diﬀerent outcomes.

It’s almost heretical to suggest that a meeting doesn’t have to end

with actions to add to our already over-stuﬀed to-do lists. However,

other outcomes might be far more important. For example, at a

recent meeting at a life sciences company, participants told one of

us (John) they found it “cathartic and hopeful” that the agenda had

been speciﬁcally designed to be an inquiring conversation rather than

their usual action-focused drills. In the weeks following the meeting,

participants’ senior leadership reported feeling an increase in the team’s

energy to the point that they felt comfortable shifting away from their

usual directive control. As a result, speed of decision making ramped

up and the market agility that had been espoused came to life, as

staﬀ in the U.S. and Europe felt trusted to use their own judgment in

co-ordinating their work.

External facilitators and invited guests can bring in fresh ideas and

perspectives. For example, diﬀerent venues can inspire diﬀerent sorts of

conversations: a walk-and-talk or meeting outside might engage a more

open mind than the goldﬁsh bowl of a glass-walled meeting room in the
