## Smith Freehills survey on the future of work ﬁnds that 97%

of employers are attempting to impose some level of top-down

control. Nondisclosure agreements and social media policies are

commonplace but vary widely in eﬀectiveness. Some companies are

taking more-novel approaches. For example, Dell’s employee advocacy

program incentivized employees to speak about their company in an

approved way by sharing brand-related content online in exchange for

certiﬁcation as a “social media and community professional.” While

analysis shows these eﬀorts may bring positive attention to businesses

in the short term, they fail to address the root cause of why corporate

and employee speech has become such a thorny issue, and what

organizations need to do to meet this moment.

To build and maintain cohesive organizational culture in a deeply

polarized, broadly vocalized society, leaders must develop norms and

processes that enable them to respond to ethical concerns and political

issues before they blow up. These processes should give employees both

agency and responsibility over when they choose to speak. And they

should help organizations act proactively and strategically to ensure

they can back up their public positions.

The time has come to rethink how organizations talk about and act on

political, social, environmental, and cultural issues. The solution is to

involve employees more eﬀectively in determining corporate advocacy,

while leaders exercise far more restraint in making promises and

taking positions. Fundamentally, your approach to cultivating corporate

culture has to change.
