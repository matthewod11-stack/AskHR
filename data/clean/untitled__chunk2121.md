# Conﬂuence of Dynamic Forces

and industrial relations had been reshaped by New Deal legisla- tion that protected workers’ rights to organize and bargain collectively with their employers. Personnel management ﬂour- ished in this environment, and a function that had previously been the responsibility of middle managers was transformed overnight into the province of executives; henceforth, no man- agerial decisions could be made without considering their impact on labor relations. (p. 132)

Early efforts to minimize the distance between labor and management were made by psychologists employed by the Scott Company in 1919 and 1920, and some I-O psycholo- gists were concerned with the labor-relations movement dur- ing the 1930s and after World War II (Gordon & Burt, 1981). The relationship between I-O psychology and labor unions has been described as one of mutual indifference, however (e.g., Gordon & Burt, 1981). One explanation for psychol- ogists’ limited involvement is that I-O psychologists are perceived as being aligned with management (Baritz, 1960; Gordon & Burt, 1991). APA Division 14 (now SIOP) past president (1970–1971) Herbert H. Meyer who worked nu- merous years in industry, offered another perspective:

Unions have a vested interest in maintaining an adversarial rela- tionship between workers and management. Thus instead of being cooperative and committed to organizational goals, union members are inclined to regard management as the enemy. And, incidentally, in unionized plants, I have found that managers are inclined to regard union employees as the enemy—a rather poor situation in which to engender cooperation and commitment. . . . [T]he desire of many progressive companies to stay non-union because of the costly work rules often associated with unionism provided for many opportunities for the employment of I/O psy- chologists. (Herbert H. Meyer, personal communication, July 20, 2000)

Unions are important in I-O psychology’s history because they affected organizations’structures, policies, and the man- agementofemployees.Thus,theimpactoflaborunionsonthe development of I-O psychology needs further investigation. The emphasis on employee welfare during the depression led to the development of personnel counseling as a popular organizational intervention for helping employees solve personal problems. Once viewed as the “new industrial psy- chology” (Cantor, 1945), personnel counseling programs dis- appeared from the domain of applied psychology and were dropped by several organizations by the 1960s (Highhouse, 1999). Highhouse suggested that industrial psychologists may have distanced themselves from personnel counseling because of poorly trained counselors employed by organiza- tions. Reasons for the decline of personnel counseling pro- grams include the questionable effectiveness of the programs and the lack of managerial support for programs addressing
