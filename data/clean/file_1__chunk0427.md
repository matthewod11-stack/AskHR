differently. Common understanding of the existence of gender inequality among people with different occupational backgrounds might be the key to achieving gender equality.

The results of the study could be also of interest for managerial and government officials. Since men continue to perceive overall gender inequality to a lesser extent than women, the study uncovers the need for Finnish government to continue to report information about policies and procedures concerning gender inequality in line with Finnish gender equality policies. This has to be done in order to continue promoting gender inequality awareness among both genders. In order to promote gender equality, managers may want to employ women to supervisory and leadership positions, and reduce inequalities in work duties and financial outcomes. Moreover, since there is room for improvement in terms of eliminating gender inequality in Finland, a gender lesson may be included in a compulsory curriculum of Finnish schools and universities in order to discuss broader issues related to gender inequality. Additionally, more efforts should be made by the media to introduce the concept of gender equality and make Finnish citizens more aware of their rights and opportunities.
