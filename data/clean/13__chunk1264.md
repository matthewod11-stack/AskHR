# Issue-Related Criteria

Clariﬁcation of the Issues When there is no settlement, issue-related criteria may be relevant for assessing the success of a third party intervention. People in dispute often deﬁne issues (and positions on the issues) differently and fail to recognize such differences. Sometimes underlying issues heighten the conﬂict, yet these remain unspoken and unexplored (Sheppard, 1984). A third party can play a valuable role in clarifying the issues for the parties. Mediation and, to a lesser extent, fact ﬁnding offer a real possibility of clarifying the issues for the parties (and perhaps identifying underlying issues that might not be otherwise discussed). Similarly, both hybrid procedures (med-arb, arb-med)

afford an opportunity to clarify the issues and explore underlying issues in the mediation phase. By contrast, arbitration (in all of its forms) tends to take the issues and positions at face value just as the parties present them. Again, this dimension might be viewed through different lenses across cultures. While some disputants might prefer a procedure where they individually have greater understanding, input and control in the process or outcomes, disputants from other cultures may not value this. For example, if individuals in a collective culture do not want to disrupt social harmony, they may not spend that much time discussing the underlying reasons for the dispute or wish to get into detail to clarify the underlying issues. It is possible that in some cases, they may feel more comfort with simply being dictated a solution that is judged to be good for the collective and not want to be confronted with unpleasant and potentially disruptive discussions. Alternately, in high power distance cultures where disputants feel the responsibility of the third party is to craft a solution, they may feel perfectly comfortable to trust that the third party is knowledgeable and will do the right thing. They may not place a high priority on detailed understanding of the dispute, but simply want a solution to be dictated (Tinsley, 1998).

The Chilling Effect A third party may also help the disputants make concessions on unresolved issues. If the disputants were unable to resolve all of their issues in dispute on their own, and the third party was able to help them do so, then the third party has played a valuable role. The ‘‘distance in positions is narrowed’’ (Carnevale et al., 1989, p. 227) and the parties are objectively closer to an agreement than they were before. Subjectively, such concessions may ‘‘build momentum’’ for later discussion and agreement. Indeed, research suggests that this ‘‘face-saving’’ capacity is one of the strengths of mediation, whether as a stand alone procedure or as a phase in one of the hybrid procedures (Pruitt & Johnson, 1970).

But as we noted earlier, third party involvement can sometimes lead to the so-called chilling effect (see Stevens, 1966; Feuille, 1975; Kochan, 1980). The chilling effect results in parties failing to make concessions that they otherwise could make and can reduce the probability of voluntary settlement. For some procedures, such as FOA, night baseball arbitration, or double FOA, the uncertainty of the third party’s decision causes additional concession-making behavior toward their actual limits, because each side wishes to present a position to the arbitrator that is slightly more reasonable than that of the other side (Hebdon, 1996; Feuille, 1975; Stokes, 1999). Alternately, in the mediation phase of med-arb, the
