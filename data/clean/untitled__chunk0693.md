Descartes had said that some ideas (such as the idea of God) cannot be found in experience but are inborn, awaiting acti- vation by appropriate experiences. Locke said that the mind was empty of ideas at birth, being a tabula rasa, or blank slate, upon which experience writes. However, Locke’s view is not too different from Descartes’, because he held that the mind is furnished with numerous mental abilities, or facul- ties, that tend automatically to produce certain universally held ideas (such as the idea of God) out of the raw material of experience.
