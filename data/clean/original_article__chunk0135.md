Of the 13 hypotheses tested in our model, 11 were supported. As for predicting the dependent variable of proﬁtability performance, all hypoth- eses directly and indirectly related to proﬁtability performance were statistically signiﬁcant and positive, other than TTP (compliance-driven), which had a strong negative impact.

DISCUSSION Overall, our model supports the F&M (1999) four-stage model, showing that, in fact, director characteristics accentuated by a healthy board- room dynamic will produce better board-level outcomes, which in turn have an impact on ﬁrm-level outcomes.

Antecedents to board performance PC and SC are supported in the model and have a direct and statistically signiﬁcant impact on proﬁtability performance. These attributes are aligned with the economic- based resource dependence theory. It is clear

that the knowledge and experience a direc- tor brings to the boardroom, as well as their network, are instrumental in accessing and utilizing resources in a manner that generates economic value. For this reason, we recom- mend that in the recruiting process nominating committees screen director candidates carefully functional and leadership for their industry, experience, and attempt to recruit directors who have a robust network of professional relationships. However, we see that PC and SC are not sufﬁcient antecedents for full parti- cipation in the boardroom. CQ is important and critical in producing effective team interac- tion (0.22, P<0.01), facilitating task perfor- mance (0.20, P<0.01) and generating TP (0.15, P<0.01) – all critical in predicting relative proﬁtability performance. We believe that higher levels of CQ are associated with higher levels of TIQ, TTP, TP and ultimately proﬁt- ability because of the ability of directors to perform effectively in the team setting. In addition, our prior research has shown that board recruiting practices can be linked to the quality of corporate governance, the success of the director candidate in assimilating in the culture unique to each boardroom, director satisfaction and director tenure (Charas, 2012). Executive recruiters assisting boards should be screening for this vital behavioral quality in serving their corporate clients, and board candi- dates seeking new appointments should culti- vate CQ skills.
