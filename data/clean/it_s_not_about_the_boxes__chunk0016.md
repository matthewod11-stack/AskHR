tial question, “Does this person consistently perform at a level higher than their peers?”

That question is the same one you’d discuss when determining where on the performance axis to place someone. You’re simply having the same conversation without a grid in front of you. The benefit of the question approach is that only high performers are eligible to be high potentials, since anyone who isn’t rated a high performer is instantly eliminated the conversation.

After that question, we ask three to five additional questions that help to categorize that person’s ability to move up in the organi- zation.

rating on people’s performance and poten- tial is somehow deleterious. It’s important to remember that a talent review is a prediction of upward potential at that moment and with the information currently available.

Someone who is rated as being in the right role, right now (Well Placed), might be consid- ered ready for promotion if their performance changes or the company’s needs change. Conversely, someone who is rated as high potential today may have that rating change if they don’t deliver results in their current role or if their capabilities become less valued by the organization. There is no harm done by stating your current view of an individual’s potential.

The criteria used in a question-based ap- proach are no different than those used with a matrix. The conversation might be more structured since you’ll ask the same questions about each individual. The output will be the same since you’re still categorizing employees by different levels of potential.

The drawback of this approach is that it ig- nores the 75%+ of employees who are not high performers or high potentials. There is no opportunity to discuss them to see if you’ve missed a few “shy-po’s” or to assess the quality and depth of a manager’s overall team on one grid.
