# The Use of Employee Handbooks

The purposes oflooking at an employee handbook is to answer the question, can a

handbook serve as an element of wrongful termination? In reply to the question, the

answer is yes. For this chapter, the fundamental issues are pitfalls that exist within an

employee handbook. An Employee handbook can and should serve as an instrumental

tool for employees to acquire information about company policies and procedures.

Despite the fact that handbooks are sometimes written in a way that does not grab the

clings to the at will employment doctrine. On the other hand Kansas, only consider the

verbiage in the handbook and an additional element to determine if an employment
