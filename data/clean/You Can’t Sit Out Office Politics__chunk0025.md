- 2. The street ﬁghter: Do you believe the best way to get ahead isthrough the use of rough tactics, even at the expense of others?3. The Team Player: Do you believe in getting ahead by workingwell with others and participate in the politics that advancegroup goals?4. The Maneuverer: Do you believe in getting ahead by playingthe games of politics in a way that is skillful and unobtrusive tothose who only take things at face value?Of course, all of us can develop skills and change our approach ifwe really want to but unless we make these changes, it’s veryunlikely that a purist will be happy or productive in a highlypoliticized environment or that a street fighter will be welcome ina minimally politicized environment.

Focusing only on your

performance currency, or the credibilityyou build through your work, is very unlikely to get you thesuccess you’re aiming for — be it a bonus, promotion, orrecognition from senior executives. However, investing time inyour networks and building the connections that can speak foryou and your work will get you those things. This investment instrategic relationships is not a distraction from your “real” job, butin fact, one of the most important aspects of it.While it’s clearly important to build relationships deliberatelywith people who can be your allies, don’t make the mistake ofneglecting to build relationships with people who have thepotential to be your adversaries. Every additional adversary thatyou have lessens your political capital and your effectiveness.
