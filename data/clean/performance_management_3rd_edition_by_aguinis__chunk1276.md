# Selected Excerpts from the University of North Carolina Performance Management Appeals Process

General Provisions Under State policy neither party in the Appeals Process may be represented by an attorney. State law and policy provide that the Chancellor’s decision on an appeal is final and cannot be appealed further.

The Appeals Process has jurisdiction over the following issues only:

- the overall evaluation received as part of the Annual Review • the rating on one or more principal functions • the explanatory remarks included in the evaluation

Depending on the actions taken by the General Assembly regarding salary increases related

to the performance evaluation process, the following issues also may be appealed:

- failure to receive a performance increase and/or performance bonus when eligible • the amount of the increase or bonus received

An employee is limited to one appeal for any work cycle, regardless of the number of issues involved. The employee should describe the complete remedy desired should the appeal be decided in his/her favor. For example, an employee who appeals the overall evaluation should specify the overall evaluation requested. If such an overall evaluation would result in eligibility for a performance increase, an increase percentage should be stated as part of the remedy requested in the appeal.

By request (and with management approval) an employee may be granted a maximum of 12 hours off from regular duties for processing an appeal under this Appeals Process without any loss of pay and without charge to leave.

Performance Management Review Board The Chancellor appoints the Chair of the Performance Management Review Board (Board Chair) and the other members of the Review Board. When a Level B appeal is received, the Board Chair selects a three-member Panel and appoints a Panel Leader. The Board Chair notifies the employee of the name, job title, and department of each proposed Panel member. The employee has the right to disqualify up to two proposed members by notifying the Board Chair before the date stated in the letter of notification.

Each panel will have one member with supervisory responsibility and two members with no supervisory responsibility. No member of the Panel will be from the employee’s own department.
