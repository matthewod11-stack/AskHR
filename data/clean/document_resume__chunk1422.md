# Exhibit 5

Exhibit 5 is a set of behavioral observation scales for the same faculty position. In this case the individual is observed and rated on a five-point Liken-type scale as to the frequency of the observed behavior. In completing the appraisal, the department head circles 1 if the individual has engaged in the behavior 0-64 percent of the time, 2 if 65- 74 percent, 3 if 75-84 percent. 4 if 85-94 percent, and 5 if 95-100 percent. A total score is determined by summing the responses to all behavioral items.
