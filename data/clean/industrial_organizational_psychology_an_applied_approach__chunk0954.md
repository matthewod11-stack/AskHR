Harris Trucking often advertises its openings for drivers on radio stations playing country music. The radio ads are used not only to recruit new drivers but to thank current drivers for doing such a good job (Gibson, ). In Ohio, Reserves Network, a job- placement firm, and WCLV-FM, a classical-music radio station, also have had great success using radio to recruit employees. In fact, WCLV found radio advertising to be its best method of recruiting minority appli- cants. In an innovative use of the media, Prudential Insurance advertised its job openings in film clips that ran in local movie theaters prior to the start of major motion pictures (Fernandez, ).
