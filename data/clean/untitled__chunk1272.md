## Appreciation of the Role of Culture in Development

One of the major shifts in our thinking about development in the current era is our recognition of the central role played by culture. Since the 1980s, more attention has been given to contributions of culture to our theoretical explanations of de- velopment (e.g., Gauvain, 2001; Rogoff, 1990). One example is the cross-cultural studies of infant–parent attachment, in which wide disparities were found in the distribution of infants in terms of their attachment classiﬁcations. Although the measures show securely attached infant–mother relations in 57% of American samples, the rate drops to 33% in sam- ples tested in northern Germany (Grossman, Grossman, Spangler, Suess, & Unzner, 1985). These and other ﬁndings underscore the need to consider cultural inﬂuences in our developmental theories.

Similarly, there have been advances, albeit limited, in our understanding of intracultural and socioeconomic differences in the United States (Parke & Buriel, 1998). Although African American children have received the most attention, other groups, including Latino and Asian American children, are beginning to be more commonly included in develop- mental investigations (McLoyd, Cauce, Takeuchi, & Wilson, 2000; Steinberg, Dornbusch, & Brown, 1992). These varia- tions across ethnic lines represent important opportunities to explore the universality of psychological processes and to provide naturally occurring variations in the relative salience of key determinants of social, emotional, and cognitive de- velopment. These studies may provide a better basis for guid- ing policies, programs, and culturally sensitive interventions

on behalf of children. As our culture becomes increasingly diverse, it is important that we begin to make a serious com- mitment to an exploration of this diversity, both theoretically and through systematic empirical inquiry. The search for a balance between processes that are universal and those that are particular to racial, and ethnic, and socioeconomic groups probably represents one of the greatest challenges of the new century.
