## III. The basic ideas and tools of behavioral economics

Much of behavioral economics emerged as the study of deviations from rational-choice principles. (The fact

that clear deviations are permitted is one way the rational-choice approach is powerful.) Deviations and

anomalies are not merely counterexamples, which any simplified theory permits; they are clues about new

or more general theories.4 I prefer alternative theories which include rational-choice as a limiting special

case. These generalizations provide a clear way to measure the parametric advantage of extending the

theory. They also make it easy to search empirically for conditions under which rational-choice principles
