# psychology.

Pareto advocated divorcing economics from psychology by simply assuming that unobserved

Benthamite utility (“the subjective fact”) is revealed by choice (“the objective fact”). He justifies this equation

(in modern terms, that choices necessarily reveal true preferences) by restricting attention “only [to] repeated

actions”, so that consistency results from learning.

The Paretian equation of choice and true preference is neither a powerful proof nor a robust empirical

regularity. It is a philosophical stance, pure and simple. And because Pareto clearly limits the domain of

revealed preference to “repeated actions” in which learning has taught people what they want, he leaves out

important economic decisions that are rare or difficult to learn about from trial-and-error (e.g., Einhorn,

1982)—corporate mergers, fertility and mate choice, partly-irreversible education and workplace choices,

planning for retirement, buying houses, and so forth.

Could economic theory have taken another path? Many economists such as Edgeworth, Ramsey, and

Fisher speculated about how to measure utility directly, but lacked modern tools and gave up3. What seemed an

impossible task a hundred years ago might be possible now, given developments in experimental psychology,

neuroscience and genetics. So this is a good time in history to revisit the ideas of Adam Smith and others, and

the paths not taken by neoclassical economists due to Pareto’s bold move.

3 Colander (2005) notes that Edgeworth described a “hedonimeter” which would measure momentary fluctuations in pleasure, and eventually provide a basis for utilitarian adding-up across people. Irving Fisher also speculated about how to measure utility in his 1892 dissertation. Ramsey wrote about a “psychogalvanometer”. It is interesting to speculate about whether at least some economists might have taken a different path in the early 20th century if fMRI, genetic methods, single-unit recording, and other tools were available which allowed more optimism about measuring utility directly. Would any of them have become neuroeconomists? Even if most did not, it is hard to believe that none of them would have, given the curiosity evident in all their writing.
