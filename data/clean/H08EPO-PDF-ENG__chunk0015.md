# Leverage reciprocity

The psychological principle of reciprocity says that when someone does

something for us, we feel naturally inclined to return the favor. So,

look for opportunities to highlight your boss’s leadership, priorities,

strengths, and successes. By showing that you value and promote

their work, you make it more likely they’ll do the same for you. This

isn’t meant to be a quid pro quo, but rather about managing up in a

supportive way that builds trust and goodwill.

Sincerity is key. Don’t force praise where it doesn’t ﬁt naturally. Just

be on the lookout for little moments to acknowledge your boss’s ideas

and contributions. This could be as simple as sending a quick note

to thank them for their guidance on how to deliver tough feedback
