# Linking Performance Management to the Company’s Vision at Loop Customer Management

At Loop Customer Management (http://www.loop.co.uk) a new direction and a new company vision statement included the alignment with an effective performance management system. Loop Customer Management is part of the United Kingdom-based Kelda Group. The company provides clients with managed customer services, contact centers, and collection services. In 2001 the company moved from being part of a utility company to becoming an outsourced provider of services. With this change, a new vision was created which centered around the phrase “great customer experiences through great people.” The company then sought to create a performance management system that would align the staff skills and behaviors to this new vision. Based on the need to focus on customer service as primary to success, Loop sought to define, measure, and reward the best service behaviors. The process meant identify- ing the specific behaviors that create a quality customer interaction and incorporating those behaviors into performance appraisals and reward systems. Creating behavioral statements allowed employees to have a clear understanding of how their work linked directly to the company’s vision. In summary, Loop Customer Management provides an example of how a performance management system can align with a vision statement to bring about organiza- tional change and execution of a business strategy.16
