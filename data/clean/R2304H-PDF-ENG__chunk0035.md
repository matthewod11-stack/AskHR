## quality hot beverages and sandwiches at competitive prices in prime

locations, just like its rivals Bagels & Beans and Starbucks. Yet there is

one diﬀerence: Many of B&D’s employees have Down syndrome.

That diﬀerence deﬁnes the company’s marketing strategy. B&D avoids high-traﬃc locations, like train stations and business districts, where

many customers just want a quick coﬀee. Instead it focuses on places

where people can sit down quietly and relax. Having people with

disabilities prepare and serve the products may at times make the

service a little slower, but it is one of the reasons some customers like

to visit the chain. Indeed, we know from research that customers value

not just the content of a product and its functionality but also how it is

produced and by whom.
