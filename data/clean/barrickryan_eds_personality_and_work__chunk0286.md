# Models of Job Performance

Although there is little agreement on the appropriate personality taxonomy to use in researching personality-performance relation- ships, there have been concerted efforts on the part of recent re- searchers to organize personality variables into a taxonomy that makes sense. The same cannot be said for the criterion side. Most meta-analyses of personality-performance relationships have been limited to a hodgepodge of whatever criteria are available, and these criteria do not come close to representing the entire domain of individual job performance. This is a by-product of the decades of neglect suffered by the job performance construct. To realize Hough’s (2001) vision of a matrix that links speciﬁc predictors to speciﬁc criteria, however, a taxonomy of job performance variables is just as important as a taxonomy on the predictor side. This sec- tion reviews recent models of job performance and integrates them into a proposed taxonomy to be used for personality research.
