change in the employee’s behaviors or work quality to justify continuing

their employment. Does that mean the PIP process failed?

No, it doesn’t.

the employee performance issues. First, you reinforce the importance

of fairness and your investment in due process. Second, you show that

process should be conﬁdential, seeing relatively swift outcomes (either

improvement or removal from role) will reassure your team members,

who have likely paid the price for their teammate’s underperformance.
