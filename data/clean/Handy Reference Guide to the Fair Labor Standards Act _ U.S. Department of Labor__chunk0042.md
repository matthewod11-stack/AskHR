# Tipped Employees

Tipped employees are individuals engaged in occupations in which they customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month

in tips. The employer may consider tips as part of wages, but the employer must pay at least $2.13 an hour in direct wages.

The employer who elects to use the tip credit provision must inform the employee in advance and must be able to show that the

employee receives at least the applicable minimum wage (see above) when direct wages and the tip credit allowance are combined. If an employee’s tips combined with the employer’s direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal the minimum

hourly wage, the employer must make up the di(cid:211)erence. Also, employees must retain all of their tips, except to the extent that they participate in a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement.
