## Declarative vs non-declarative graph(cid:157)

Some frameworks are declarative, requiring developers to explicitly de]ne every branch, loop, and conditional in the work[ow upfront through graphs consisting of nodes (agents) and edges (deterministic or dynamic handoYs). While bene]cial for visual clarity, this approach can quickly become cumbersome and challenging as work[ows grow more dynamic and complex, often necessitating the learning of specialized domain-speci]c languagesW

In contrast, the Agents SDK adopts a more Zexible, code-\rst approach. Developers canŒ directly express workZow logic using familiar programming constructs without needing toŒ pre-de\ne the entire graph upfront, enabling more dynamic and adaptable agent orchestration.
