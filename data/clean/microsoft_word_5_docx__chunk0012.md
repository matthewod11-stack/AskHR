# Leadership

It is clear that leadership is fundamental for the effectiveness of work groups and for

the organizations to which they belong (Baquero Pecino & Sánchez Santa-Bárbara, 2000).

During a visit to Spain, John Kotter, speaker on the subject of Leadership and Change, stated that “it is not possible to manage organizations of the 21st century using frameworks from the 20th century and directors from the 19th century”, and that only one out of every five persons occupying an executive position has the makings of a leader.

Leadership must respond effectively to the new needs of organizations: innovation, cultural diversity, work-based knowledge, communication, and work groups. Work groups play a central role in organizations, and leadership is essential for the effectiveness of these teams (Judge & Piccolo, 2004; O`Reilly, Caldwell, Chatman,Lapiz & Self, 2010).
