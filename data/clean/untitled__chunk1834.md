# Jean Marie Charcot

Charcot undertook research in the use of hypnosis with a selected group of hysterical female patients. They were typi- cally put in the ﬁrst stage of hypnosis, a cataleptic trance, by the use of a bright light or a sudden noise. The second stage, lethargy, was induced by having the patients shut their eyes, and the third stage, somnambulism, by instructing the patient to move about. Charcot believed that hysteria was caused by a morbid organization of the nervous system, and he de- scribed the hysterical crisis as comprised of four stages: the epileptoid phase, the large movements phase, the passionate attitudes phase, and the termination stage of delirium and muscular resolution. The similarity between symptoms of hysteria and those that can be induced by hypnotic suggestion led Charcot to theorize that hypnosis is a form of experimen- tal hysteria, and that susceptibility to hypnotic suggestion can only be found in hysterical patients. He conjectured that the hysterical symptoms are a consequence of autosuggestions generated within a region of the patient’s mind isolated from waking consciousness.

Charcot repeatedly performed experiments on dozens of hypnotically susceptible patients, some of whom were paid a fee and maintained for this purpose in the hospital. One day a week, his clinic, with lectures on and demonstrations of hysterical patients, was open to the general public. His clinic became a highly fashionable event attracting a variety of socialites, actors, authors, and others who came to observe patients presenting dramatic portrayals of the “classical” states of lethargy, catalepsy, somnambulism, and seizures. Charcot was criticized for exploiting sick patients; con- versely, Charcot faced charges that the patients learned their symptoms as they were rehearsed repeatedly in the sorts of responses he expected, because their welfare depended on their displaying the behaviors he sought to validate his theo- ries. His patients have been described as vying with each other to produce the classical symptoms to make themselves more interesting.

One patient, Blanche Wittmann, nicknamed the Queen of Hysterics because of her talent in reproducing the three stages of hypnosis with a grand ﬁnale of a hysterical “crisis,” is said to have confessed to Jules Janet, a brother of Pierre Janet, that even during the throes of a hypnotic trance she was aware of her “act.” It was said that Charcot’s interns and other assis-
