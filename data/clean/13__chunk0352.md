skills (e.g., Keil & Cortina, 2001), or broadening it even further as I do above by considering all individual-level performance-causing characteristics (including abilities, skills, knowledge, and motivation), then the focus of the model is wider and more consistent with static models of job perfo- rmance (e.g., Campbell, 1990; Motowidlo et al., 1997; Schmidt et al., 1986). Additionally, with a broader focus, the changing-subjects model can be seen as complementary to the changing tasks model rather than as a competing alternative explanation (Keil & Cortina, 2001).

The Changing Tasks Model In addition to changes in individual characteristics, performance changes may be attributable to job changes, new job roles, or revised organizational requirements. The changing tasks model predicts that an individual’s performance changes because the determinants of performance change (Alvares & Hulin, 1972; Deadrick & Madigan, 1990; Fleishman & Hempel, 1954). Changes in job requirements – such as after a promotion, transfer, the introduction of new technology, or other change in job duties – may lead to the need for new sets of abilities while reducing the impact of current abilities on job performance (Alvares & Hulin, 1972; Fleishman, 1953, 1960; Fleishman & Hempel, 1954; Fleishman & Rich, 1963; Murphy, 1989; Steele-Johnson et al., 2000). For example, a scientist may be promoted to a management position (e.g., Boudreau & Berger, 1985). In this circumstance, the company might lose a high performing scientist while gaining a poor performing manager. When an employee changes jobs, individual characteristics may remain the same, but the changes in the job duties may cause different individual characteristics (e.g., managerial experience and knowledge rather than scientiﬁc experience and knowledge) to become determinants of job performance.

By drawing attention to how the requirements of individual performance change over time, the changing tasks model may also explain variance in performance remaining after controlling for prior performance (e.g., Sturman et al., 2005). The effect of task changes on performance dynamism depends on the similarity between the old job and the new job. The greater the similarity, the more that past performance should be able to predict future performance.

The logic behind the changing tasks model is consistent with the underlying assumption behind such organizational actions such as work redesign (e.g., Hackman & Oldham, 1976) and empowerment (e.g., Lawler, 1986). That is, by changing the nature of the job, environment, or organization, employee job performance can be improved.
