## large companies in the S&P 500—be the very embodiment of the hyper-rational

Homo oeconomicus? For example, would executive selection processes not ensure

that more rational and socially neutral agents rise to the top? Not necessarily. As

long as a specific bias is not negatively correlated with the ability to have a success-

ful corporate career, CEOs are not necessarily less likely to deviate from rational

decision-making than the average individual. Goel and Thakor (2000) also point out

that managers may even be more likely to be promoted to CEOs in a tournament set-

ting if they underestimate project risk, which leads them to take very risky projects

with the largest probabilities of very large returns. In the implicit rank-order tourna-

ment among potential successors of a CEO, the biased person is thus more likely to

have the highest outcome, conditional on success, and is therefore unconditionally more likely to have the highest rank.*!

Moreover, if superior management skills are correlated with limits on rationality

and self-interest then it is conceivable that top managers are even more judgmen-

tally biased and social-comparison-minded than average workers. Confidence may

be correlated with other kinds of managerial value—like inspiring workers or mes-

merizing Wall Street analysts-—so sorting may actually select for overconfidence

rather than filter it out. Mistakes in one type of judgment may be a price one pays for

21 See Van Den Steen (2004) for a related argument about the endogenous generation of overconfidence

due to the selection of tasks in which the agent is likely to succeed.
