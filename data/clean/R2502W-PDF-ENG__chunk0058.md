they will need to acquire nontechnical capabilities, such as empathy,

caregiving, and working collaboratively with a team of healthcare

professionals to design the right course of treatment for a patient.

assets, and network eﬀects. For example, a consumer-product

designer can now use AI to create new prototype designs to meet

certain speciﬁcations. The designs are informed by the quality and
