# Family Medical Leave Act

In , Congress passed the FMLA, which entitles eligible employees (both male and female) to a minimum of  weeks of unpaid leave each year to deal with the following family matters:

7 7 7

7

Births, adoptions, or placement for foster care To care for a child, parent, or spouse with a serious health condition For employee’s own serious health condition that makes him or her unable to perform the job In , President George W. Bush signed the National Defense Authorization Act that amended the FMLA to provide  weeks of unpaid leave for a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin to care for a member of the military.

All public agencies and private organizations with  or more employees physi- cally employed within a -mile radius of one another are covered by the act. Employers can decide if they want to define the eligibility period as a calendar year (i.e., January through December) or as a rolling -month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. If the employer does not define its eligibility period in the employee handbook, the method most favorable to the employee will be in force (Dodaro v. Village of Glendale Heights, ).

Employees are eligible if they

. work for a covered employer, . have worked for the organization for at least one year, and . have worked at least , hours over the previous  months.

Because the FMLA allows employees to take leave for the serious illness of a child, parent, spouse, or themselves, there has been some debate about how serious an illness has to be to qualify. The Department of Labor defines a serious health condition this way:

Any period of incapacity of more than  consecutive calendar days and at least  visits to a healthcare provider or one visit and issuance of prescription medicine (or) Any period of incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition requiring periodic treatment covering an extended period of time (or) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments for a condition that would result in a  or more day period of incapacity if left untreated.
