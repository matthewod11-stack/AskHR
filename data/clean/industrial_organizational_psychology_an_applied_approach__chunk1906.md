# Learning through Apprentice Training

Apprentice training is used by more than , people annually and is typi- cally found in crafts and trades such as carpentry and plumbing. With apprentice training, an individual usually takes  hours of formal class work each year and works with an expert for several (usually four) years to learn a particular trade and perhaps become eligible to join a trade union. Although apprenticeships are usually formal agreements between labor and management and are regulated by

the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, as well as by state agencies, apprenticeships can also be less formal.

For example, an apprentice working with a plumber will initially help the plumber by carrying supplies, picking up parts from suppliers, and holding tools. But with time, the apprentice is taught the necessary knowledge and skills for plumbing. When the apprenticeship is complete, the apprentice can start his own business.

Apprenticeships are good for both the apprentice and the expert. The appren- tice learns a valuable trade, and the expert or the organization gets inexpensive labor—usually one half the cost of expert labor. This is why apprenticeships have become more popular over the last few decades. Organizations also use appren- ticeships to “grow their own” employees for jobs that are difficult to fill. For example, Moog Components Group in Blacksburg, VA, developed an apprentice- ship program to develop machinists. To complete the program, apprentices must complete , hours of on-the-job training and successfully complete  classes taught by the local community college. To make the classes more convenient for the  apprentices, the community college holds the classes at the Moog facility (Jackson, ).

Despite this increased popularity, however, apprenticeship programs have been criticized for two major reasons. First, the emphasis during the apprentice- ship often is on the production of work as opposed to teaching new skills to the apprentice. Second, unions use apprenticeships to restrict entry into their trades, which results both in inflated wages caused by high demand and a lower sup- ply of workers, and in unfair minority hiring practices. Employers often shun apprenticeships for fear that the apprentice will become a competitor or join a competing company.

Learning through Coaching and Mentoring Coaching Coaching is another popular method of training new employees and typically takes one of two forms: experienced employees working with new employees and professional coaches who work with all employees.

Experienced Employees as Coaches. In this form of coaching, a new employee is assigned to an experienced employee, who is told to “show the kid the ropes.” Coaching can be highly effective, allowing the new employee the chance to learn from a job expert. After all, who knows a job better than a person who has mastered it for several years? Coaching provides just-in-time training, flexible scheduling, cus- tomized training, and a smaller financial commitment than many other types of training (Leeds, ).

Coaching, however, has its own problems. First, good workers are not neces- sarily good trainers, and good trainers are not necessarily good workers. Being able to do a job is not the same as explaining it. For example, have you ever asked a great dancer to show you some dance steps, but they were unable to explain how they danced? In sports, the best coaches often have been terrible players. This is not to say, of course, that excellent employees or players will never be good teach- ers or coaches. For example, in the world of sports we have seen such successful basketball players as Bill Russell, Larry Bird, and John Wooden become excellent coaches. In education, we see successful people leave industry to become fine educators. The key is finding a way to identify those workers who will be good

coaches or trainers. One solution has been to establish “train-the-trainer” pro- grams, in which future trainers or coaches are taught the skills they will need to train other employees.

A second problem with coaching is that it diminishes the expert’s productiv- ity (Wexley & Latham, ). That is, while the expert shows the new employee how to do the job, his own production declines. If he is on a bonus system, he may lose money as his production declines, as will the organization if the experi- enced employee is an outstanding worker. One solution to this problem is for the organization to reward workers who do well in training new employees.

Many organizations, such as Pitney-Bowes, have also adopted pass-through programs, in which experienced workers are temporarily assigned to the training department. These workers are taught training techniques and then spend sev- eral months training new employees before resuming their old jobs.

Professional Coaches. To overcome the problems mentioned here, many organiza- tions are using “corporate coaches.” Corporate coaches are similar to consultants, yet rather than working with the organization as a whole, they are hired to coach a particular employee—usually a manager. The job of a corporate coach goes beyond traditional training, as they also help employees identify strengths and weaknesses, set goals, and solve problems. DaimlerChrysler is an example of an employer that uses coaches in its call centers. Each call center has a professional coach who works with employees and managers. For example, a manager may be having a problem with an employee who is short with customers. As a result, the manager goes to the coach for help. The coach might begin by listening to some of the employee’s calls and then work with the manager on how to provide feedback to the employee. The coach might listen as the manager talks to the employee and provide additional feedback to the manager.

Mentoring Mentoring is a form of coaching that has recently received much attention. A mentor is a veteran in the organization who takes a special interest in a new employee and helps him not only to adjust to the job but also to advance in the organization. Typically, mentors are older and at least one level or position above the employee being mentored. American Cyanamid Agricultural Products is a good example of an organization using mentoring. Cyanamid previously had its sales trainees spend  months in the classroom but has reduced classroom train- ing to  months and now puts the trainees in the field with  of  “master reps” who serve as mentors. With time, trainees get greater responsibility until they can finally handle calls on their own. This change to mentoring is credited with a substantial increase in sales.

As with coaching, not all employees make good mentors; thus, both the mentor and the mentor-employee match must be carefully chosen. However, meta-analysis results indicate that, in general, having a mentor is beneficial to an employee’s career (Eby, Allen, Evans, Ng, & DuBois, ; Kammeyer-Mueller & Judge, ). Interestingly, a study of  mentoring relationships found that mentoring was more effective when the relationship was informal rather than formal (Ragins & Cotton, ).

Performance Appraisal As discussed in Chapter , one of the major uses for employee performance evaluation is training. One excellent method of on-the-job training is to have a

supervisor meet with an employee to discuss his strengths and weaknesses on the job. Once the weaknesses have been identified, the supervisor and employee can determine what training methods would best help the employee to improve his job knowledge or skill.

But using performance appraisal for both training and determining raises and promotions can be difficult. As pointed out by Kirkpatrick (), three factors account for this difficulty. First, the focus on salary administration is on past behavior, whereas the focus for training is on future behavior. Second, per- formance appraisal for salary administration often is subjective and emotional, whereas such appraisal for training is objective and unemotional. Finally, salary administration looks at overall performance, whereas training looks at detailed performance. Because of these differences, Kirkpatrick () suggests the use of two separate performance appraisal systems in an organization—one for salary administration and the other for training.
