# Recordkeeping

The FLSA requires employers to keep records on wages, hours, and other items, as specified in DOL recordkeeping regulations. Most

of the information is of the kind generally maintained by employers in ordinary business practice and in compliance with other laws and regulations. The records do not have to be kept in any particular form and time clocks need not be used. With respect to an

employee subject to the minimum wage provisions or both the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions, the following records must be kept:

- 1. personal information, including employee’s name, home address, occupation, sex, and birth date if under 19 years of age;

- 2. hour and day when workweek begins;

- 3. total hours worked each workday and each workweek;

- 4. total daily or weekly straight-time earnings;

- 5. regular hourly pay rate for any week when overtime is worked;

- 6. total overtime pay for the workweek;

- 7. deductions from or additions to wages;

- 8. total wages paid each pay period; and

- 9. date of payment and pay period covered.

Records required for exempt employees di(cid:211)er from those for nonexempt workers. Special information is required for homeworkers, for employees working under uncommon pay arrangements, for employees to whom lodging or other facilities are furnished, and

for employees receiving remedial education.
