performance related outcomes.

LMX, which is a relational approach to leadership, has been viewed as both a

leadership variable in its own right and as a mediator explaining the effects of other

leadership styles (e.g. Wang et al., 2005). This has resulted in confusion regarding the

treatment of LMX in combination with other leadership styles. Inconsistencies in the

literature about the conceptualisation and positioning of LMX have been carried over into

meta-analytic work in the area. For instance, while Ng and Feldman (2015) describe LMX as

a leadership style, others have positioned LMX, alongside trust in the leader, as an attitudinal

outcome of leadership (e.g. authentic leadership, Banks et al., 2016; ethical leadership, Bedi

et al., 2016). In addition, Dulebohn et al. (2012) treat LMX as a mediator, driven by styles

such as transformational leadership. Hoch et al. (2018) argue that, unlike other leadership

styles, LMX does not focus on leader behaviour and is thus more accurately captured as a
