# Is the Requirement a BFOQ?

Employment decisions based on membership in a protected class (e.g., “We will not hire females because they are not strong enough to do the job”) are illegal unless the employer can demonstrate that the requirement is a bona fide occu- pational qualification (BFOQ).

If a job can be performed only by a person in a particular class, the requirement is considered a BFOQ. Actually, some jobs can be performed only by a person of a particular gender; for instance, only a female can be a wet nurse (a woman who breast-feeds another woman’s baby), and only a male can be a sperm donor. However, there are very few jobs in our society that can be per- formed only by a person of a particular race, gender, or national origin. Take for example a job that involves lifting -pound crates. Although it is true that on average, males are stronger than females, a company cannot set a male-only requirement. The real BFOQ in this example is strength, not gender. Thus, restricting employment to males would be illegal.

The courts have clearly stated that a BFOQ must involve the ability to per-

form the job, not satisfy a customer’s or client’s preferences. For example:

Geraldine Fuhr v. School District of Hazel Park, Michigan (), In the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the preference that a man rather than a woman coach a boy’s basketball team was not a BFOQ. Diaz v. Pan American Airways (), the court ruled that even In though airline passengers prefer female flight attendants, the nature of the business is to transport passengers safely, and males can perform the essential job functions as well as females. In , Caesar’s Casino in Atlantic City was fined $, for removing African American and female card dealers from a table to appease a high-stakes gambler who preferred White male dealers.

One of the few exceptions to the BFOQ requirement seems to be grooming standards. It is not unusual for an organization to have separate dress codes and grooming standards for males and females. Though different standards based on sex would appear to violate the law, the courts have generally upheld them ( Fowler-Hermes, ) (Jespersen v. Harrah’s Casino, ).

Perhaps the most interesting of the BFOQ cases was the EEOC complaint against Hooters, the restaurant chain famous for its chicken wings and scantily clad waitresses. Hooters allowed only women to be servers and claimed that it was a BFOQ due to the restaurant’s unique atmosphere. In fact, a Hooters spokes- man was quoted as saying that the restaurant doesn’t sell food, it sells (female) sex appeal, and to have female sex appeal, you have to be female. The EEOC dis- agreed; and in an unusual settlement, Hooters agreed to pay $. million to a group of men who were not hired, and the EEOC agreed to let Hooters continue to hire only women for the server positions.

Has Case Law, State Law, or Local Law Expanded the Deﬁ nition of Any of the Protected Classes?

An employment decision may not violate a federal law, but it may violate one of the many state and local laws that have been passed to protect additional groups of people. For example, at the state level:

Two states (California, New York) and the District of Columbia forbid discrimination on the basis of a person’s political affiliation. Eighteen states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia prohibit discrimination

by private and public employers based on sexual orientation; nine states (Alaska, Delaware, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania) only prohibit discrimination by public employers; and one state (Iowa) prohibits discrimination by private but not public employers (updated information can be found at www.lambdalegal.org/ our-work/states). Twenty-one states (Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia forbid discrimination based on marital status.
