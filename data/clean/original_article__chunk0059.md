Hypothesized model and results.

our study and the sources of scales used can be found in Table 1. These constructs are discussed in detail below.

Board characteristics – Independent variables Board director PC and SC measures were operationalized by accessing three sources of information: public domain information about director professional proﬁles; private third- party information about director social capital (BoardEx); and by collecting primary informa- tion from directors themselves about their level of cultural intelligence.

Professional Capital: To best understand the types of skills/competencies and relative impor- tance directors place on PC, we referenced prior research conducted on directors of public companies (Charas, 2012). Our prior research indicated that board directors are primarily recruited for their knowledge, experience and social network. In our study, we deﬁne knowl- edge and experience as PC, which was repre- sented by a score calculated by standardizing and then weighting attributes represented in Table 2.

Social Capital: SC was a raw score collected from a relationship capital management data- base (BoardEX). This raw score represents the number of connections each director has in a database of over 500 000 directors of both public and private organizations. SC raw score was converted to a standardized value.

Cultural Intelligence Quotient: (CQ) measures metacognitive, cognitive, motivational and behav- ioral aspects of adapting to different cultures. For our research, we measured only three aspects of director’s behavioral characteristics including metacognitive, motivational and behavioral and excluded cognitive as this aspect is not relevant to board tasks. Metacognitive aspects capture ‘the mental processes that individuals use to acquire and understand cultural knowledge, including knowledge of and control over indivi- thought processes.’ Motivational aspects dual measure the ‘capacity to direct attention and energy toward learning about and functioning in situations characterized by cultural differences.’ Behavioral aspects describe the ‘capability to exhibit appropriate verbal and nonverbal actions when interacting with people from different cultures’ (Ang and Van Dyne, 2008). The most critical aspect of CQ is the behavioral aspect as
