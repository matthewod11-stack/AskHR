Instead, leaders need to develop “cultural intelligence”—a ﬂexible

intercultural ﬂuency for adapting to culturally complex situations. I

have spent over two decades researching and consulting with leading

international organizations on how to manage workers and teams in

diﬀerent cultural contexts. My research shows that honing cultural

intelligence is an unending discipline, reﬁned through a lifetime of

work and experience. But a good starting point is to understand the

most common mistakes that derail Western leaders and learn how to

use cultural intelligence to avoid them.
