Alliance Program: Through the Alliance Program, OSHA works with businesses, trade and professional

encourage, assist, and recognize eﬀorts to eliminate serious hazards and achieve a high level of worker safety

and health. All Partnerships emphasize sustained eﬀorts and continuing results beyond the typical three-year duration of the agreement.

lecturers for speaking engagements. Most of these ﬁeld oﬃces have an OSHA Compliance Assistance

Specialist (CAS). CASs provide general information about OSHA standards and compliance assistance resources, and are available for seminars, workshops, and speaking events. CASs promote OSHA's

cooperative programs and also encourage employers to take advantage of OSHA's training resources and the
