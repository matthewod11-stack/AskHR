## Compound Personality (Predictor) Variables

Compound variables, deﬁned by Hough and Schneider (1996) as a combination of basic personality traits that do not necessarily co- vary, have rapidly become a new frontier of personality research. There are a number of examples of insights gained about impor- tant work-related outcomes and the role of compound variables in those outcomes:

- Fox and Spector (1999) in their study of work frustration and aggression

- Penner and his colleagues (Penner & Finkelstein, 1998; Pen- ner, Fritzsche, Craiger, & Freifeld, 1995; Penner, Midili, & Kegglemeyer, 1997) in their study of prosocial personality • Bateman, Crant, Seibert, and Kraimer (Bateman & Crant, 1993; Crant, 1995; Seibert, Crant, & Kraimer, 1999; Seibert, Kraimer, & Crant, 2001) in their study of the proactive person- ality variable

- Judge and his colleagues (Erez & Judge, 2001; Judge & Bono, 2001a, 2001b; Judge, Locke, Durham, & Kluger, 1998) in their study of core self-evaluations

- Leach (2002) in his study of soldiers who evade capture by the enemy

- Ones, Viswesvaran, and Schmidt (1993) in their meta-analysis of integrity scales
