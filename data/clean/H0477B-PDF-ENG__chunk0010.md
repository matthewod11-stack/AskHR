The new Walmart policy: 10 paid weeks for birth moms and 6 weeks

for other new parents, regardless of whether the employee is hourly

or salaried. That’s much more than employees get at firms with which

Walmart competes for workers, such as hourly workers at Yum! Brands,

another large employer, which operates Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and

others, where store managers get 6-8 weeks if they’re birth mothers,

and nothing at all if they’re biological fathers. (Executives get more,

but hourly workers get nothing.) And at McDonald’s? New parents in

management roles get a single week. That’s right: one week. Hourly

workers? Again, they get nothing.
