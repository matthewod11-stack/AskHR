# Capture

Start by creating a spreadsheet and dividing the workday into 15-minute

increments. Some people ﬁne tune this with 10-minute blocks, others

broaden it to 30 minutes. Those are okay, too, but I do not suggest going

all the way up to 60 minutes, as a lot of the smaller tasks will start to get

lost.

While there are excellent apps out there for time tracking, many of

them have a decent-sized learning curve that results in leaders giving up

before they get going. If you have an app that you like and will reliably

use, you should do that. Otherwise, the humble spreadsheet is an easy

tool most of us know how to use.

Once you have created your log, take some time, two to three times

a day, to reconstruct how you spent your time over the prior two to

four hours (yes, this can feel a lot, but it reaps beneﬁts in the long

term). Anything that took longer than ﬁve minutes goes into the log,

including people dropping by with a question, lengthy text exchanges,

reading reports, and meetings you attended. For the ﬁrst week, just

capture everything; don’t start analyzing your data yet. You want to get

a realistic accounting of what you are doing without judgment. Also, try

to add to your log multiple times each day instead of waiting until the

end of the day (or the next day). Most of us can’t remember what we had

for lunch yesterday, let alone how long we spent answering questions

when someone dropped by.
