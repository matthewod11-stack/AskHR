# 4.1.3 Discriminant Validity

For discriminant validity, Fornell-Larcker criterion was used which compares inter- construct correlation values and the square root of AVE. As per this test, discriminant validity exists among construct if the square root of AVE is greater than the correlation of a variable with other variables in the model. The following table compares these values. That is, all the correlation values less than the square root of AVE values and so, the discriminant validity is acceptable (Kim, 2010).
