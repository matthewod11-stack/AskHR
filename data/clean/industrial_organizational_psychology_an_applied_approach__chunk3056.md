# Group Roles

Another factor that affects the performance of a group is the extent to which its members assume different roles. For a group to be successful, its members’ roles must fall into one of two categories: task oriented and social oriented (Stewart, Fulmer, & Barrick, ). Task-oriented roles involve behaviors such as offering new ideas, coordinating activities, and finding new information. Social-oriented roles involve encouraging cohesiveness and participation.

A third category—the individual role—includes blocking group activities, calling attention to oneself, and avoiding group interaction. Individual roles sel- dom result in higher group productivity.

Group members will often naturally assume these roles on the basis of their individual personalities and experiences. For example, people high in conscien- tiousness tend to fill task-oriented roles, and people high in agreeableness tend to fill social-oriented roles (Stewart et al., ). When roles are not naturally filled by group members, leaders must assign roles to certain individuals. For example, if a leader notices that every group member is filling a task-oriented role, she may either recruit a new group member or assign a current member to fill a social role.
