# HBR / Digital Article / 6 Questions to Help You Decide What You Want in Your Next Job

In short, career choices are complex, and there’s never a guarantee that

you will switch to the right role or job, so the proof of the pudding

is always in the tasting. That said, while the job market and careers

may be hard to predict, there is one part of the equation that is rather

predictable—namely, you. Moreover, a failure to understand yourself

and your needs will rarely lead to good choices, except by accident or

serendipitously. My hope is that the above questions can guide you to

reﬂect on who you are and what you want, and even what you may

need, so that you at least minimize avoidable errors when it comes to

the knowns, which are your values, interests, and personality.
