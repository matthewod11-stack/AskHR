# team.

Ask yourself: How am I doing right now? What pace have I been keeping?

Then assign a color rating:

- Red: Depleted and need recovery • Yellow: Stretched, but managing • Green: Energized and focused

You can keep this private or occasionally share your status with your

team to normalize conversations about capacity and sustainability.
