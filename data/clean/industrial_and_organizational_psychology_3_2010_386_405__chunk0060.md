## not an effective cure for halo and leniency errors.

Anotherexample isgoalsetting. AsIOOB researchers have become less interested JDM researchers in the effects of goals, have become more interested (e.g., Larrick, Heath, & Wu, 2009; Ord´o˜nez, Schweitzer, Galinsky, & Bazerman, 2009). Ed Locke and Gary Latham’s research should be just the beginning not the ﬁnal word. Finally, peo- ple interested in management development (and derailers) and multisource feedback should be closely following the JDM lit- erature on comparative evaluation (e.g., Dunning, Johnson, Ehrlinger, & Kruger, 2003; Moore & Small, 2007). Perhaps joint workshops and symposia at SIOP would help engage IOOB more in the latest devel- opments in JDM.

Question 6: Ifyoubelievethattheﬁeld ofIOOBshouldattempttoinﬂuencethe ﬁeldofJDM,whatareyourrecommen- dations for increasing cross-fertilization fromIOOBtoJDM?

the topics I mentioned earlier, including how to communicate effect sizes and utility, are such new areas within JDM that I think that IOOB could really be of added value. We certainly have the psychometric background that is often lacking in JDM. We love methodology in IOOB, so this is an area where we can make a lot of contributions.
