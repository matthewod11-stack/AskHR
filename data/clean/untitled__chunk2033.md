THE RISE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING 359 WAR AND THE TRAINING OF PSYCHOLOGISTS 360

Beginnings, for the most part, tend to be arbitrary. Whether chosen for historical precision, maintenance of myth, conve- nience, or necessity, beginnings tell us something of how we want our story to be told. For the purposes of this chapter, the genesis of counseling psychology is viewed through the con- text of the Progressive Era of the early twentieth century. For purposes of convenience the chapter will start at the begin- ning of the twentieth century; the reader is asked to consider that the substantive story of the history of counseling psy- chology is a story of the twentieth century.
