# eal that the effects of ET in

traditional work settings differ from those in the GVT context, with the main difference being that for takers (Entitleds). satisfaction in GVTs is always higher for givers (Benevolents) than Furthermore, satisfaction is positively associated with overrewarding for givers and negatively associated with over-rewarding for takers (Figure 1). Hence, we conclude that GVTs produce an environment whereby givers will always experience a higher and growing satisfaction than takers. This is a highly relevant conclusion as it creates new information pertinent to the current business environment, even more so given the nature of remote, highly collaborative teamwork.

The findings of this study have important implications for future research and practice and

are relevant for society at large. Gaps in the body of knowledge are thus bridged and a clear connection is laid between the theory and practice. That way, research can directly yield relevant economic and commercial impact for the organization. At the same time, these fi ndings can be used for training, teaching and influencing public policy to influence public attitudes to im prove the quality of life of GVT team members.

The explanation lies in the highly interdependent nature of intellectual work in GVTs,

y and makes which renders it virtually impossible to identify individual contributions separatel Entitleds dissatisfied with the idea of other teammates exploiting their contribution. The stricter they evaluate themselves compared to their teammates’ evaluations (so the higher the equity ratio), the less their job satisfaction. Our findings corroborate the notion that we live i n a modern, postindustrial world that is highly dependent on team collaboration, specialization and division of labor – particularly collaborative intellectual work.

In fact, and in line with the work of Morand and Merriman (2012), our findings corroborate y of the idea that the combination of cultural elements and team dynamics produces a downpla differential inputs to create a motivated harmony, which – consciously or unconsciously – aims to reward all participants equally, or at least to some degree. In other words, in the GVT context, the empirical evidence from this study points to an even and balanced process of assessing Equity and Fairness. In that sense, our findings show a higher satisfaction derived from being a Benevolent (“giver”) in the GVT context. In contrast, no expectation feeds what the Enti leds are used to expecting (as a specific recognition for their alleged superior contribution).

This is quite an interesting point because most of the debate in business organizati

hinges on equity -based reasoning, whereby the different input levels should receive different rewards as output. However, despite being underestimated, many popular organizational practices move toward “existential-based equality”: this view does not postulate that business organizations reward equally different inputs or pretend inputs to be equal because it is i mpossible to measure differences. Rather, equality-based distributive decisions are theoretically grounded in the notion of equal contributions in an existential sense and not solely due to measurement considerat ions (Morand and Merriman, 2012).

A collection of managerial practices is becoming increasingly popular in many moder

business organizations (and even more so in GVTs), whereby the opportunity for status and symbolic differentiations has been greatly diminished. This orientation is corro borated by academic research and practice that reinforces the impo rtance of ET in the workplace because it embodies the balance between how employees feel about their work and how hard they should work. In addition, fairness in the workplace has been mandated by law in some countries (such as the UK’s Equality Act of 2010); therefore, employers are responsible for ensuring that employees s should reward receive equitable and fair treatment. In light of our research findings, employer GVT members equally and refrain from giving excessive importance to overrewards for Entitleds. Examples of “status leveling” (Morand, 2010; Walton, 1985) or ‘symbolic egalitarianism’ (Pfeffer, 1995) are linked to the elimination of perks, differential office and parking space, forms of address, linguistic honorifics, job titles, differential washroo restaurants and cafeterias, differential dress codes, or any other perquisite, special right or privilege enjoyed as a result of one’s position. In addition, GVTs, due to teamwork and online activity, offer far fewer opportunities for individual recognition than the traditional work environment, where ET has been developed (Bergiel et al., 2008).
