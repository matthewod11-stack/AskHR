# Task Analysis

If the results of the organizational analysis indicate that a positive organizational cli- mate for training exists, the next step is to conduct a task analysis. The purpose of a task analysis is to use the job analysis methods discussed in Chapter  to identify the tasks performed by each employee, the conditions under which these tasks are per- formed, and the competencies (knowledge, skills, abilities) needed to perform the tasks under the identified conditions. The most common job analysis methods used for this purpose include interviews, observations, and task inventories. If an orga- nization has detailed and current job descriptions already written, the task analysis process is fairly easy and does not take much time. If such job descriptions are not available, the task analysis process can be expensive and time-consuming.

Once the tasks and competencies for a job have been identified, the next step is to determine how employees learn to perform each task or obtain each compe- tency. For example, due to a rigorous employee selection process, we might expect employees to be able to perform many of the tasks at the time they are hired. Some tasks might be so simple that they can be performed without the need of previous experience or future training. For other tasks, we might have formal training pro- grams to teach employees the necessary competencies needed to perform them.

As shown in Figure ., the task analysis process is usually conducted by listing tasks in one column and how the tasks are learned in a second column. As you can see, the hypothetical bank needs to develop training courses in dealing with dif- ficult customers and in cross-selling, because these are competencies not tapped during the selection process nor learned in current bank training programs.

As another example, let’s examine the job of a secretary. Obviously, tasks involving typing will be found throughout the job description. If we take just one of these tasks—typing internal memos—we can see that certain knowledge and skills are involved: typing skills, knowledge of the company’s word-processing package, knowledge of the computer used to do the word processing, and knowl- edge of the memo format used by the organization.

In all probability, the company will require that a newly hired secretary already possess typing skills; thus learning how to type will not be a training need. Knowledge of the word-processing program may or may not be required at the time of hire. If not required, then learning the program will involve extensive training, whereas learning how to use a computer also becomes a training need (this training, however, should take only a short time). Finally, learning the memo format used by the organization is another training need, but one with relatively little time required. With these needs in mind, the supervisor or the training offi- cer must arrange for the new employee to receive needed training.
