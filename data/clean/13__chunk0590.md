# (f) Addictions.

Although people with addictions are viewed more negatively in the U.S. than individuals who are addiction free, there is a tendency to attribute some types of addictions (e.g., alcohol, tobacco) to biological causes (Stone et al., 1992). However, in many Islamic countries there are strong cultural taboos against using alcohol, and alcoholics are ostracized in society (Bush, White, Kai, Rankin, & Bhopal, 2003). In addition, smokers are often stigmatized in such countries as Pakistan and Bangladesh, and women who smoke in these countries are often considered outcasts by their families (Bush et al., 2003).
