An employer may apply for VPP at the nearest OSHA regional oﬃce. OSHA reviews an employer's VPP

application and visits the worksite to verify that the safety and health program described is in eﬀect at the site.

All participants must send their injury information annually to their OSHA regional oﬃces. Sites participating in the VPP are not scheduled for programmed inspections. However, OSHA handles any employee complaints,

serious accidents/catastrophes, or fatalities according to routine procedures.

The VPP is available in states under federal jurisdiction. Additionally, all OSHA-approved state plans that cover

private-sector employees in the state operate similar programs. Interested companies in these states should

contact the appropriate state agency for more information.
