Transparency also requires that leaders expand their repertoire of

communication styles to align with the varying comfort levels and

values of team members. Ex-Googler Kim Scott says leaders need

to use radical candor with everyone. From her perspective, even

“obnoxiously aggressive feedback” is better than “ruinous empathy”

lest leaders withhold feedback that might be helpful. However,

this approach assumes that bluntness is the only eﬀective way

to provide clear feedback. In most cultures people communicate

more indirectly. They are not necessarily being passive-aggressive or

dishonest; they’re just communicating the same message in a diﬀerent

way. Indirect communicators expect their leaders to trust them to be

intelligent enough to interpret subtle cues without the discomfort of

a confrontational approach. There’s an art to deftly communicating in

ways that are crystal clear but without a blunt edge.

An expanded repertoire of communication styles enables leaders to

adapt—modifying when and how much information to share—to ensure

that their message is received clearly and builds trust. Some team

members want play-by-play updates during a crisis, while that level

of transparency induces anxiety for others, particularly if there’s no

resolution or proposed plan yet. Others may prefer that leaders outline

theoretical principles before diving into practical applications.

Culturally intelligent leaders understand that their preferred approach

may not build trust with every team member. By adjusting their

approach, they build deeper connections, enhance clarity, and respect
