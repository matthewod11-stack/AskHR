## Youth Sport Leadership Development: Leveraging the Sports Captaincy Experience

DANIEL GOULD and DANA K. VOELKER Institute for the Study of Youth Sports, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA

Leadership has been identiﬁed as an important but underdeveloped life skill among youth athletes. This article discusses a recent effort to develop leadership by taking a formal educational approach to the sport captaincy experience. More speciﬁcally, the Institute for the Study of Youth Sports has partnered with the Michigan High School Athletic Association to create the MHSAA Captain’s Lead- ership Training Program. The program’s design, structure, and content are discussed as well as our biggest successes, challenges, and future directions. Implications for sport consultants, coaches, and other practitioners are provided.
