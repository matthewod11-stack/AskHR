## Level One: Competency Models for Indi- vidual Occupations

Competency models are typically developed for individual occupations. To identify the critical competencies for an occupation, OPM uses supervisor and incumbent ratings of importance as well as the ratings by supervisors on the com- petencies that are needed for entry into a job. These critical competencies, along with criti- cal tasks, form an occupational profile. Agen- cies and their subject matter experts review these models to ensure the fit of the model within the organization. OPM has used these profiles for a number of purposes, ranging from input into major federal initiatives to the post- ing of job announcements. Some highlights of OPM’s application of these models follow.

Competencies used to revise qualification stan- dards. Building on the results of the occupa- tional studies, OPM began a comprehensive review of federal qualification standards (mini- mum qualifying standards to enter an occu- pation) to identify how this occupational in- formation can be used to update these stan- dards. Starting with pilot projects for accoun- tant and information technology positions, OPM is testing the modification of minimum qualification standards used for federal posi- tions. This change would move the federal government from using rigid, traditional time-in-grade and experience requirements to a “whole-person” competency-based model, using the competency models of individual occupations. A competency-based approach offers many advantages over the traditional system for identifying qualified applicants for federal positions. The competencies identified for occupations are soundly grounded in the scientific analysis from the MOSAIC studies.
