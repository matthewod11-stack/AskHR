Compensating CEOs and Executives

There is no question that executives are compen-

sated well. And there has always been a gap between executives and workers. But this gap is widening. In 1973, the top CEOs in the nation made about 45 times the wage of the average worker. As of August 29, 2007, according to Daniel Lubien of Inter- press Service, CEOs were being paid approximately 364 times that of an average worker.

According to Forbes, the top fi ve CEOs in 2007 earned the following amounts through salaries and stock options: 7

Steve Jobs, CEO, Apple. Mr. Jobs is founder of Apple and has been the CEO for 10 years. He earned $646 million.

Dr. Ray Irani, CEO of Occidental Petroleum. Dr. Irani has been CEO of Occidental for 16 years and has

been with the company for a total of 24 years. He earned $321 million.

Barry Diller, CEO of IAC/Interactive Corp. Mr. Diller has been the CEO for all of the 12 years he has been with the company. He earned $295 million.

William Foley, CEO of Fidelity National. Mr. Foley is founder of Fidelity National and has been the CEO for one year. He made $179 million.

Terry Semel, CEO, Yahoo! Mr. Semel has been CEO of Yahoo! for the six years he has been with the com- pany. He made $174 million.

CEOs and other executives say that high compensation buys better performance from them, which includes their ability to create new jobs for workers in commu- nities that might otherwise have high unemployment.

The job factors usually used to decide such compen- sation include the level of responsibility, education requirements, experience, and sometimes working conditions.

There are advocates and opponents for these

high compensation packages. On the one hand, the level of education, experience, and responsibil- ity greatly diff erentiates CEOs and executives from the average worker. Publicly traded companies are accountable to their stockholders. So, these executives are being paid to make money for the company and its stockholders. And to make money, the company has to signifi cantly compensate its executives for high performance.

On the other hand, these high compensation packages could come at the expense of the workers who actually make the product or deliver a service to consumers. As executives continue to be compensated at higher and higher levels for their performance, the focus of increasing wages and salaries for the

average worker may decline if the company does not have some set standards of values and ethics. And, as your textbook says, the choice of compensable factors is often more philosophical than empirical—which means this level of compensation may not be necessary to motivate executives to perform well.

What do you think? 7

Are CEOs being paid too much or are they worth the high compensation packages they receive? Is it ethical or fair that a CEO receives a bonus when employees are being laid off or having their ben- efi ts reduced? Does high compensation for CEOs actually increase company performance? Should a company’s number one focus be on mak- ing money for its shareholders? What might be other ethical factors surrounding this issue?
