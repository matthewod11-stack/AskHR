To ensure that this national

that there are thousands of veterinarians throughout the country, this was indeed a daunting task. 1. How would you conduct such a large-scale job analysis?

2.

- 3. How many veterinarians would you include in your job analysis? More information about this case can be found by following the link on the text website.
