# 2.2. The Need for Succession Planning

Employee retirement planning and timing have important implications for all institutions. Unplanned early or late retirement can directly affect the human resources department. Replacing an experienced employee with an inexperienced employee can be difficult. The most common retirement age for public employees is between 60 to 65. On-time retirement refers to the conventional age of retirement, at or around age 65 (Boveda & Metz, 2016). There are several types of retirements: baby boomers' retirement, delayed retirement, earlier retirement, and expected retirement. Apart from retirements, positions can be vacant due to emergencies such as sudden death, resignations and terminations.
