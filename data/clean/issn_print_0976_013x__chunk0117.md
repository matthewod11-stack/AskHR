Involvement of the technical agency to provide their expertise to the tribal women is limited for

a short period. Once the processing unit takes off, the technical agencies exit the scene. Hence

the village-level processing units are under constant threat from the big players. Hence, it is

government can increase financial support to make such ventures sustainable. Moreover, such

endeavours can be gainfully integrated with self-help groups. Also, the government can make

concerted efforts to promote the non-farm sector in the country to help small and marginal

farmers in supplementing their income during lean seasons when there is no work in the farms.
