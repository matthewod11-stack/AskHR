pointing out a problem, he followed it up with a simple question:“How can I help?”In your own situation, it’s similarly important to deliver difficultnews or alert your manager to a big concern. Yet it’s alsoimportant to ask yourself: How often am I doing this? Am I asperceived as someone who

always looks for problems? If so, yourideas won’t resonate. People may start to tune you out becausethey don’t want to deal with the messy situations you bring up orthey may start to believe you’re not interested in solving theproblems you bring up.Instead, aim to ease the tension when discussing difficult issues.Be prepared to discuss possible solutions as well, and if nonecome to mind, show your good intent by saying something like:“I’m not sure what the solution is yet, but I know there is one.What does the group think?”It’s not about you.Finally, remember that sharing the best idea is not a contest youneed to win. It’s not about you and your ego. It’s about youraudience, their communication preferences, and how you canmeet them where they are at.Ask yourself: How can I package my thoughts in a way that willresonate with my audience? How do

they like things presented?For example, if your manager only wants to hear the headline butyou’re someone who likes details, refrain yourself. In yourpresentation, only focus on what’s absolutely necessary to makeyour case. On the other hand, if your manager likes details butyou dislike the nitty gritty, step up and include the specifics.Remember, good communication is about considering the otherperson.
