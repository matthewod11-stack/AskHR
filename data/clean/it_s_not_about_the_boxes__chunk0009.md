# About the Potential Axis

We describe the best science about how to define potential in our recent article, “Poten- tial after the Pandemic,” so we won’t repeat that here. We will reinforce, however, that potential should be measured by the ability to move upward over a set period.

We use that definition because potential is the primary input to succession planning. If a company doesn’t know what talent can move up at what pace, it is literally impossible for them to plan for succession.

The pace at which, and the reasons why, someone can move up in any given organiza- tion will differ. This means that your defini- tion for movement over time may differ from other companies.

Potential labels should directly state how far and how fast someone can move up in the organization. How you divide those time peri- ods is up to you, but we recommend starting with what you believe is the fastest possible upward movement that can happen in your organization. After that, the next category should describe what feels like relatively fast movement. If that sounds subjective, it is.

Our “generic” labels for the potential axis of a 9-box grid are Two Levels in Five Years, One Level in Two Years and Well Placed. “Well Placed” is used very intentionally instead of other possible choices. Labeling someone “low potential” is a non-starter in most companies not to mention slightly insulting. Well placed declares that, at this moment in time, you do not see the individual being promoted within 2 years.
