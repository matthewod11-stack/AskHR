Your choice depends on what you believe is

the number of meaningfully different ways that people can demonstrate performance and potential in your organization. If you genuine- ly believe there are 28 different ways people can do that, then a 28-box grid meets your needs.

In considering the “right” number of box- es, we suggest that the definition of any one box should feel unique and separate from the others. For example, someone we describe as a high potential leader should sound different from a high-performing leader. That high-per- forming leader definition should sound differ- ent than an average performing leader who is well-placed. If there’s not a meaningful dif- ference in how you define two boxes, they’re likely describing the same type of individual

It’s also easy to overvalue symmetry in the tool. We believe that it is not possible to be a consistently low performer and still have high potential to advance. In a typical 9-box model that suggests that the lower right-hand box (and possibly the center-bottom box) should not exist. The resulting seven box grid may look lopsided, but it’s more accurate than including boxes in which no one will ever be rated.
