Extending this broadened deﬁnition of inclusion to the study of inclusive leadership, it is useful to remember that there are factors both in- and outside of a leader’s control that inﬂuence the extent to which followers’ needs for uniqueness, belonging, and competence are satisﬁed. Current events within the broader society, the larger organizational context, and a history of needs frustration are examples of factors outside a leader’s control. However, leaders do have control over their interactions with followers. Thus, the focus of inclusive leadership at the individual-level involves leader behaviors that enable each individual follower to experience inclusion (Randel, et al., 2018)—that is, to experience the psychological states of belonging, auton- omy, andcompetence (Figure 1,link 1a)—sothat they can perform at their best (Figure 1, link 1b). Importantly, in the context of diversity, this necessitates being aware of and proactively dismantling the barriers that systematically thwart the fulﬁllment of these needs for members of marginalized social identities. Leaders must also attend to social comparative processes—or how followers perceive their experiences relative to their workgroup peers (Figure 1, link 1c).
