## the gaps with their own often worst-case what-ifs. Eikenberg suggests

steeling yourself by asking not “What should I do?” but “Who do I want

to be?” Being clear on how you want to show up for your team can

help center you in times of stress, she says. It’s about your presence

and approach as much as your words: staying calm, being patient, and

building trust by talking candidly about challenges while still pointing

to what’s possible. Remember: “This is just one drop in the bucket of

your long leadership life,” she says. “The more conﬁdence and clarity

you have about who you want to be, the more muscle you build to

handle it the next time. And there is going to be a next time,” she says.
