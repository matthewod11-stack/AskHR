married individuals as by unmarried ones. Relative deprivation theory claims that a married individual may differ from an unmarried one in the relative value he/she places on various outcomes and characteristics of his/her marriage. According to the theory, while married individuals tend to value stability and harmony in their relationships, unmarried individuals are likely to appreciate more independence and autonomy. In addition, some empirical evidence has shown that married and cohabiting individuals may be less critical towards gender inequality than those who are not married (Cohen and Korchmeyer, 1995; Davis and Robinson, 1991).

In many cases people may believe that female married employees are supported financially by their spouses and this, in turn, may be used to legitimate offering them lower salaries (Winslow-Bowe, 2009). In contrast, male married employees are likely to be given greater responsibility, promotion, relocation opportunity and salary based on the assumption that they have families to care for (Winslow-Bowe, 2009). In other words, if a wife’s salary is believed to be a secondary income and a husband is expected to earn more than a wife, then it is not surprising that both members of a family consider that husband’s salary should be higher than wife’s. Consequently, based on relative deprivation theory, married individuals/employees are suggested to perceive both gender inequality and the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than unmarried ones.

Occupational categorization: occupational socialization theory (Smith and Rogers, 2000) claims that people are socialized within the work environment through training, organizational culture, and workplace rewards. Employed people might thus be more socialized and more conscious of cases where male and female employees are treated differently while performing similarly than, for example, students (Judge and Livingston, 2008; Paul, 2006). In contrast, students tend to have little experience of working life or no data about such cases so they are less likely to be conscious of gender inequality than employees. Based on occupational socialization theory, retired people might be suggested to perceive gender inequality to a greater extent than employed people and students because they have more experience and are more likely to have witnessed or heard about cases, which involve persistence of gender inequality.

Reconciliation of work and family: according to role-balance theory (Marks and MacDermid, 1996), individuals seek full and meaningful experiences in their work and family lives. The theory claims that in order to achieve balance, one should distribute his/her personal resources across all life roles in an ‘even-handed’ fashion, which tends to lead to a more equal engagement in work and family obligations (Carlson and Grzywacz, 2008). Nowadays, many employees face the problem of time reconciliation at both professional and private levels. Since the degree of achievement of gender equality in a workplace depends, among other issues, on the extent to which workplace policies address the issue of reconciliation of work and family (Lewis and Giullari, 2005), reconciliation policies may provide employees with the notion of workplace gender equality. It is thus suggested that the more positive is the concern of the employer towards the reconciliation of work and family, and the better is the employee’s balance between work and family, the less the employee is expected to perceive workplace gender inequality, and vice versa.
