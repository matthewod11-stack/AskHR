## —whose enterprise oﬀerings power millions of organizations—has

sounded the alarm.

This disruption will have ripple eﬀects far beyond software companies.

Most large companies depend on various enterprise systems to handle

foundational workﬂows, including booking sales, calculating ﬁnancial

results, and paying employees. Thousands of IT professionals support

this software, and the daily workﬂows of millions of employees involve

daily interactions with it. If companies shift from SaaS software to AI,

many of those jobs will change in signiﬁcant ways—and some will go

away altogether. For senior leaders, guiding organizations through this

shift will be a challenge.
