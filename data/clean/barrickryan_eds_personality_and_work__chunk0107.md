# Organizing the Subcomponents

There are two distinct ways of organizing the more speciﬁc sub- components of the broad factors, called the horizontal and verti- cal approaches (Goldberg, 1993b), and any complete taxonomy of personality attributes must include both kinds of organizational features. The vertical aspect refers to the hierarchical relations among the variables (for example, Reliability is a more abstract and general concept than Punctuality), whereas the horizontal aspect refers to the degree of similarity among variables at the same hi- erarchical level (Wit involves aspects of both Intelligence and Humor).

The deﬁning feature of horizontal models is that the relations among the variables are speciﬁed by the variables’ locations in mul- tidimensional space. When that space is limited to only two di- mensions and the locations of the variables are projected to some uniform distance from the origin, the resulting structures are re- ferred to as “circumplex” representations. The most famous ex- ample of such models is the Interpersonal Circle (Kiesler, 1983; Wiggins, 1979, 1980), which is based on variants of the Extraver- sion and Agreeableness factors in the Big Five model. Other ex- amples of circumplex models include those that incorporate the ﬁrst three of the Big Five factors (Di Blas & Forzi, 1999; Peabody & Goldberg, 1989; Stern, 1970); the affective-interpersonal factors based on Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability (Saucier, 1992); and two replicated nonevaluative factors (Saucier, Ostendorf, & Peabody, 2001).
