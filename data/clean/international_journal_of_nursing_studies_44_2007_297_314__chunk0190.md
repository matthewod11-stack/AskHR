# 5.6. Educational attainment

Inconsistencies were apparent in overall results for the relationship between levels of education and job satisfaction. However, some ﬁndings contradicted the (1981) and earlier Cavanagh (1992) by suggesting that higher educational attainment led to greater satisfaction at work and lowered intention to leave (Tzeng, 2002; Yin and Yang, 2002; Rambur et al., 2003). This contradiction may have occurred as a result of changes to nursing education that have developed over recent years in the countries where these studies were located (i.e. Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, US), most notably the introduction and expansion of degree-level qualiﬁcations. For example, Rambur et al’s that baccalaureate education emphasises a greater under- standing of the context of health care delivery allowing for greater satisfaction. They suggest that it is this to enhanced understanding that empowers nurses inﬂuence the macro factors impacting on their work environment resulting in a reduction of dissatisfaction. If so, it could have relevance for the profession in the UK which, in an era of fast-paced change, may beneﬁt from further expansion of degree education. However, the inconsistent results in both early and recent studies would suggest that educational attainment is a widely varying factor for which conclusions cannot yet be drawn and as such warrants further investigation.
