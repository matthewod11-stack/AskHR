# system iterate.

Stack those three ingredients and you get a general-purpose automation

engine. Two data trends now accelerate the ﬂywheel. First, models

can mint limitless synthetic examples—for instance, generating virtual

“driving miles” that cover every oddball scenario, rather that relying

on data from real world drivers. And second, AI is increasingly

ﬁelded across a variety of devices and sensors—on phones, in cars,

and elsewhere—as a low-cost surveyor, capturing and quantifying real-

world signals that were once too expensive or impractical to measure.

If you can shoehorn a phenomenon into numbers, AI will learn it and

reproduce it back at scale—and the tech keeps slashing the cost of that

conversion, so measurement gets cheaper, faster, and quietly woven

into everything we touch. More things become countable, the circle

resets, and the model comes back for seconds. That means that any job

that can be measured can, in theory, be automated.
