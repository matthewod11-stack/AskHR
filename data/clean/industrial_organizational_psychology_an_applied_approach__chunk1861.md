Feedback. Another essential aspect of motivating employees to learn is to provide feedback. With some tasks, feedback occurs naturally. For example, in baseball, a batter receives feedback on his swing by seeing how hard and far the ball travels. For other tasks, however, judging the correctness of a behavior without feedback is difficult. For example, if you write a term paper for this class and get a C, your next term paper will probably not improve unless you have been provided feed- back about what was right and wrong with the previous paper.

The same is true for training in industry. Our electronics assembler needs feedback early in the training process to know if the winding is tight enough, if there is an easier way to wind the coil, or if the winding is equally distributed on the coil. A balance, however, must be maintained between giving too little and too much feedback. As shown in Figure ., the employee will not learn if too little feedback is given. However, too much or overly detailed feedback causes frustration, and the employee will not learn at an optimal level.

A final consideration for feedback concerns what type of feedback to give. Research and common sense agree that positive feedback should be given when an employee correctly performs a task during training. Praise provides an incen- tive to continue correct behavior. But if an employee is not performing a task correctly, should he receive negative feedback? Probably, even though negative feedback is more complicated than positive feedback. Negative feedback should probably also be accompanied by specific suggestions for how the employee can improve performance.

Motivating Employees to Use Their Training on the Job Once employees have gathered knowledge and skills from a training program, it is essential that they apply their new knowledge and skills on the job itself. Perhaps the factor that plays the biggest role in employee motivation to apply training is the atmosphere set by management. That is, employees are most likely to apply their new knowledge and skills if supervisors encourage and reward them to do so.
