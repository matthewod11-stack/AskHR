organisational consequences such as pay and job assignments, transfer and promotion decisions and that it is not ``ordinarily geared to improving work unit performance or manager behaviour''. They go on to suggest that, while training and development decisions may be an espoused outcome of traditional performance appraisal, this purpose usually suffers because the focus of the performance appraisal itself is to evaluate the past performance of the individual concerned. On the other hand, 3608 degree feedback is usually used primarily in organisations as a development tool for the learner. The most salient difference between these two processes is that there is only one rating source in the traditional approach and the 3608 feedback approach utilises a number of ratings sources. Becker and Klimoski (1989) point out that, unlike traditional supervisor appraisal, 3608 feedback recognises the complexity of management and the value of input from these different sources. Table II summarises the key differences between these two approaches to performance appraisal.
