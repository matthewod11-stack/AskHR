# Findings and analysis

Before we tease out why firms persist with such workers, we first provide a brief overview of

some of the early-warning signals. Our study uncovered a number of early-warning signals

leading to the identification of an underperforming worker. These include declining

performance, lack of motivation and low productivity. An informant noted:

“When they are unable to meet the agreed targets … At the beginning of every quarter,

employees are assigned their task for the period.” (G11)

Another informant elaborated:

“I think inability to deliver results accurately and timely is the key indicator.” (N2)
