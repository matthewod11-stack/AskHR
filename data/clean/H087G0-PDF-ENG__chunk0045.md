## positive work environment despite your health challenges. In some

cases you may also consider a “radical” disclosure (such as educating

colleagues about your condition in a meeting, explaining how it impacts

your communication in your email signature, or “coming out” via social

radical disclosure can expand your network in ways that prevent the

potentially catastrophic consequences of losing a sole supporter.
