# level two.

There are considerations beyond context, however. Which level of

responsibility a CoS should have depends as well on the skills and

ambition of the person hired for the role and the chemistry and trust

that develop between the CoS and the CEO. In some cases a level two

CoS may evolve to level three duties over time as trust and abilities

develop and the relationship deepens.
