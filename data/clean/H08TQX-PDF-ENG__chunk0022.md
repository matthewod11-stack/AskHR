## accomplishments and express gratitude to employees for their

contributions. If it’s an award ceremony, can you also include a

gratitude wall that allows people to publicly share how other teammates

have meaningfully contributed? If it’s an annual meeting, can you

devote time to thanking individual units for speciﬁc accomplishments?

As a leadership team, can you create a plan so that every employee

at the party is personally thanked by at least one executive? Be sure

to publicly acknowledge the accomplishments of all units so that all

attendees are reminded that their eﬀorts and achievements are noticed

and valued.

- 4. Don’t make it hard for employees to be themselves.

Employees react poorly to rituals that create pressure for them to

show “fake” enthusiasm. Allow employees to engage authentically

without requiring participation in activities that may feel contrived

or uncomfortable. This includes forcing employees to attend in the

ﬁrst place. Where possible, make attendance optional, with this policy

explicitly communicated by leaders. This is especially critical if the

ritual takes place during personal time.
