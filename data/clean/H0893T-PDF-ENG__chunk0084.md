## Counterproductive Practices That Hinder Diverse Representation

Four of the most pervasive management practices — performance

evaluations, diversity and harassment training, grievance procedures,

and job tests for managers (standardized reading and writing tests or

assessments of work-related skills) — are each counterproductive for

attaining diverse managerial representation. While these practices may

reduce legal trouble, they fail to increase managerial diversity.

These methods often exacerbate existing biases and fail to address

systemic barriers, perpetuating organizational inequities. For example,

diversity and harassment training programs frequently focus on blame,

legal consequences, and unconscious bias. Employees are often told

they are biased, and managers are informed that they will be held

accountable if employees are accused of discrimination. This is

counterproductive because employees tend to react with resistance

and anger to these messages, inadvertently increasing discriminatory

behavior. Employees may leave these courses either feeling like they

have been accused of being bad people or deciding how questionable

their behavior can become before crossing legal thresholds.

Grievance procedures are ineﬀective because employees are often

discouraged from ﬁling grievances or are subjected to retaliation.
