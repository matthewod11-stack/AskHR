# 2.3 PERFORMANCE EXECUTION

Once the review cycle begins, the employee strives to produce the results and display the behaviors agreed upon earlier as well as to work on developmental needs. The employee has primary responsibility and ownership of this process. Employee participation does not begin at the performance execution stage, however. As noted earlier, employees need to have active input in the development of job descriptions, performance standards, and the creation of the rating form. In addition, at later stages, employees are active participants in the evaluation process in that they provide a self- assessment and the performance review interview is a two-way communication process. At the performance execution stage, the following factors must be present:12

- 1. Commitment to goal achievement. The employee must be committed to the goals that were set. One way to enhance commitment is to allow the employee to be an active participant in the process of setting the goals.

- 2. Ongoing performance feedback and coaching. The employee should not wait until the review cycle is over to solicit performance feedback. Also, the employee should not wait until a serious problem develops to ask for coaching. The employee needs to take a proactive role in soliciting performance feedback and coaching from her supervisor.13

- 3. Communication with supervisor. Supervisors are busy with multiple obliga- tions. The burden is on the employee to communicate openly and regularly with the supervisor.

- 4. Collecting and sharing performance data. The employee should provide the supervisor with regular updates on progress toward goal achievement, in terms of both behaviors and results.

- 5. Preparing for performance reviews. The employee should not wait until the end of the review cycle approaches to prepare for the review. On the contrary, the employee should engage in an ongoing and realistic self-appraisal so that immedi- ate corrective action can be taken if necessary. The usefulness of the self-appraisal process can be enhanced by gathering informal performance information from peers and customers (both internal and external).

Although the employee has primary responsibilities for performance execution, the supervisor also needs to do his or her share of the work. In fact, monitoring the performance of colleagues has been identified as a key competency by the Management Standards Centre (www.management-standards.com, Unit B5). Supervisors have primary responsibility over the following issues:14

- 1. Observation and documentation.

Supervisors must observe and document performance on a daily basis. It is important to keep track of examples of both good and poor performance.

- 2. Updates. As the organizationâ€™s goals may change, it is important to update and revise initial objectives, standards, and key accountabilities (in the case of results) and competency areas (in the case of behaviors).

- 3. Feedback. Feedback on progression toward goals and coaching to improve performance should be provided on a regular basis certainly before the review cycle is over.
