## HBR / Digital Article / Learning to Delegate as a First-Time Manager

As a manager, your success is not equal to being the best performer

on your team. It’s determined by your ability to help your team grow,

reach their goals, and contribute to the larger company vision. That

involves helping them learn the tasks they’re working on, and when

appropriate, creating opportunities for them to take on more visible or

challenging work. If you resist this change, you’ll likely end up like Tom

— overwhelmed and (unintentionally) holding onto opportunities that

could be given to your team.

That’s why learning to delegate is so important. It can help you

gain back valuable time and give your direct reports more chances

to develop their skills. Delegating is all about loosening control and

increasing accountability. Once you embrace this, you will become more

Once you accept that delegating is a part of your job, you can

realistically think about what work to take on, what work to hand oﬀ,

and who to hand it oﬀ to. Write out a comprehensive list of every task

or project on your plate this month. Then, ask yourself the following

questions to identify which items would be best to delegate:

What tasks or projects hamper my ability to work on the “high-level” projects that only I can carry out?

Be realistic with yourself about what “high-level” entails. Like Tom, you

may initially be biased, believing that most tasks can only be done by

you. To keep your biases in check, think through the responsibilities

of your role. “High-level” projects are often the ones that contribute to

your company’s longer-term strategic priorities and are less urgent than

a day-to-day task. A few examples might include: creating development

goals for your team members, setting quarterly benchmarks, or

contributing to a cross-functional initiative as a representative of your

department. This work requires your experience, input, and expertise as
