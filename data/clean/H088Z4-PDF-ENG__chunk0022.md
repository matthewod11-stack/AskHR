How would disclosing these unfavorable EEO-1 reports change how

people viewed these companies? We recruited a diverse sample of 2,000

people from the U.S. and asked half of them to share their impressions

of the company after seeing their respective EEO-1 reports. For the other

half of the people, we asked them to evaluate the companies but never

disclosed or made mention of their diversity numbers. We found clear

evidence that disclosing unfavorable EEO-1 reports led companies to

be viewed more positively than not disclosing them at all. Speciﬁcally,

people viewed these companies as more genuinely committed to

diversity and more trustworthy. They also reported being more likely

to say that they would promote this company’s diversity eﬀorts to their

network. Perhaps most striking, we asked people to what degree they

thought the company had made progress in their eﬀort to increase

diversity. People viewed the company that had disclosed the negative

data as having made signiﬁcantly more progress than those that had

never disclosed a single ﬁgure. The act of transparency meaningfully

changed the way in which people understood the company’s struggles
