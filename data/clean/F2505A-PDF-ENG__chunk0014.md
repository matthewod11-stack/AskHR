# ways.

The researchers drew several conclusions from their analysis. First,

the later that startups receive their ﬁrst round of funding, the more

likely they are to keep experimenting after the money arrives. Second,

startups that receive a bigger investment use more technologies after

cashing the check but combine them in less unusual ways, signaling

reduced experimentation. Last, the track record of the investors

(including whether they exited past investments through IPOs or

acquisitions by other ﬁrms) aﬀects how much companies continue

experimenting after launch, and the timing and size of the ﬁrst

investment can impact how long a startup survives.
