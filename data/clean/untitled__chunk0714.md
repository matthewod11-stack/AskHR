it with food. In Pavlov’s setup, the food came ﬁrst and caused the unconditional response; in Thorndike’s, no obvious stim- ulus caused the ﬁrst correct response, and the food followed its execution.

Were Pavlov and Thorndike studying two distinct forms of learning, or were they merely using different methodolo- gies to study the same phenomenon? Some psychologists, including Skinner, believed the former, either on the opera- tionist grounds that the procedures themselves deﬁned differ- ent forms of learning, or because different nervous systems were involved in the two cases (Hearst, 1975). Although this distinction between instrumental (or operant) and classical, or Pavlovian (or respondent) conditioning has become enshrined in textbooks, psychologists in the S-R tradition be- lieved S-R learning took place in both procedures. The debate was never resolved but has been effaced by the return of cognitive theories of animal learning, for which the distinction is not important.

The second question raised by Pavlov’s methods was inti- mately connected to the ﬁrst. Exactly what was being associ- atedaslearningproceeded?Inphilosophicaltheory,association took place between ideas, but this mentalistic formulation was, of course, anathema to behaviorists. Thorndike began the S-R tradition by asserting that the learned connection (his preferred term) was directly between stimulus and response, not between mental ideas of the two. Pavlovian conditioning could be interpreted in the same way, saying that the animal began with an innate association between US and UR and cre- ated a new association between CS and CR. Indeed, this was for years the dominant behaviorist interpretation of Pavlovian conditioning, the stimulus substitution theory (Leahey & Harris, 2001), because it was consistent with the thesis that all learning was S-R learning.

However, Pavlovian conditioning was open to an alterna- tive interpretation closer to the philosophical notion of asso- ciation of ideas, which said that ideas that occur together in experience become linked (see above). Thus, one could say that as US and CS were paired, they became associated, so that when presented alone, the CS evoked the US, which in turn caused the CR to occur. Pavlov’s own theory of con- ditioning was a materialistic version of this account, propos- ing that the brain center activated by the US became neurally linked to the brain center activated by the CS, so when the latter occurred, it activated the US’s brain center, causing the CR. American behaviorists who believed in two kinds of learning never adopted Pavlov’s physiologizing and avoided mentalism by talking about S-S associations. It was some- times said that Tolman was an S-S theorist, but this distorted the holistic nature of his cognitive maps. As truly cognitive theories of learning returned in the 1970s, Pavlovian and
