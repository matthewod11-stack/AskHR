## 1.3 DISADVANTAGES/DANGERS OF POORLY IMPLEMENTED PM SYSTEMS

What happens when performance management systems do not work as intended, as in the case of Sally’s organization? What are some of the negative consequences associated with low-quality and poorly implemented systems? Consider the following list:

- 1. Increased turnover.

If the process is not seen as fair, employees may become upset and leave the organization. They can leave physically (i.e., quit) or withdraw psychologically (i.e., minimize their effort until they are able to find a job elsewhere).

- 2. Use of misleading information.

If a standardized system is not in place, there are multiple opportunities for fabricating information about an employee’s performance.

- 3. Lowered self-esteem.

Self-esteem may be lowered if feedback is provided in an inappropriate and inaccurate way. This, in turn, can create employee resentment.

- 4. Wasted time and money. Performance management systems cost money and quite a bit of time. These resources are wasted when systems are poorly designed and implemented.

- 5. Damaged relationships. As a consequence of a deficient system, the relationship among the individuals involved may be damaged, often permanently.

- 6. Decreased motivation to perform. Motivation may be lowered for many reasons, including the feeling that superior performance is not translated into meaningful tangible (e.g., pay increase) or intangible (e.g., personal recognition) rewards.
