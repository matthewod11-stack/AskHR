## Expanded Directions for Working Readability Graph 1.

Randomly select three sample passages and count out exactly 100 words each, beginning with the beginning of a sentence. Do count proper nouns, initializations, and numerals. Count the number of sentences in the 100 words, estimating length of the fraction of the last sentence to the nearest one-tenth. Count the total number of syllables in the 100-word passage. If you don’t have a hand counter available, simply put a mark above every syllable over one in each word. Then when you get to the end of the passage, count the number of marks and add 100. Small calculators can also be used as counters by pushing numeral 1, then pushing the + sign for each word or syllable when counting. Enter graph with average sentence length and average number of syllables; plot dot where the two lines intersect. Area where dot is plotted will give you the approximate grade level. If a great deal of variability is found in syllable count or sentence count, putting more samples into the average is desirable. A word is defined as a group of symbols with a space on either side; thus Joe, IRA, 1945, and & are each one word. A syllable is defined as a phonetic syllable. Generally, there are as many syllables as vowel sounds. For example, stopped is one syllable and wanted is two syllables. When counting syllables for numerals and initializations, count one syllable for each symbol. For example, 1945 is four syllables, IRA is three syllables, and & is one syllable.

Figure 11.8 Graph for estimating readability

The Flesch Index (Flesch, ) uses the average sentence length and number of syllables per  words; the FOG Index (Gunning, ) uses the number of words per sentence and the number of three-syllable words per ; and the Dale-Chall Index (Dale & Chall, ) uses the number of words that are not included in a list of words known by % of fourth graders.
