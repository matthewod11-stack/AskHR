# random component, additive to skill- and effort-based output (“luck”), with distri-

bution m(6;). dn the simplest analysis, skill is homogeneous or does not matter, so

F (ei, 8) = e;.) Firms observe output x; and pay a wage w(x;). This could be a

fixed wage, w(x;) = w;; a step function or bonus package, w(x;) = {w; for x; <

tj; w; +b; for x; > tj}; a linear wage, w(x;) = wo + 6.x, etc. In subsequent sec-

tions we will assume that w(x;) is increasing in x;. Assume also that preferences

are separable in effort disutility and utility from wages. Then the agent’s expected

utility is

BU(e;) = [ ulw(f (ei, si) + 9)]m @;) dO; — clei), (7.1)

where the disutility of effort, c(e;), satisfies the usual assumptions, is increasing

in e;, and convex. The principal’s earnings are 7 (f (e;, 5;) +4;) — w(f (ei, 513) + 4),

where 7r(-) is the (gross) revenue of the firm.
