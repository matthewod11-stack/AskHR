## 7.2. COMPLICATING THE SINGLE-AGENT RisK-INCENTIVE MODEL

A good place to start is to discuss how psychology complicates the simple risk-

incentive model of principal-agent relations that is a workhorse in organizational

economics. First we will lay out a simple agency model with one type of activity. In

the standard labor economics model, workers face a prevailing wage and decide how

much labor to supply at that wage (and consume the remaining hours as leisure).

We assume that people like money and, by definition, dislike work and like leisure.

A useful way to critique the standard principal-agent model is to ask when its

basic assumptions are violated. The goal is not to heckle the modelâ€™s shortcomings

(which are an inevitable byproduct of simplicity), but to offer empirical facts and

build up intuition about how it could be extended in useful ways.

We start with a simple exposition of a standard agency model. Worker i chooses

effort e;, which has cost c(e;). The productivity of effort also depends on a vari-

able called skill, s;, so that observed output is x; = f(e;, 5;) + 6;, where 6; is a
