## HBR / Digital Article / Research: How to Build Consensus Around a New Idea

In a recent paper, published in Nature Human Behavior, we explored

why people disagree about an idea’s value. Through a mix of

experimental and archival studies, we found that the more novel an

idea, the more people disagreed about its worth.

We also found that people often interpret disagreement itself as a

sign of risk, lowering their belief in an idea’s value, and making them

less likely to support it. The bad news is this newness-disagreement

link forms a barrier to innovation by making more creative ideas

seem less appealing. But understanding why this problem occurs

creates opportunities to address it. We evaluate our ﬁndings to propose

research-backed strategies to help your team build consensus when

evaluating new ideas.
