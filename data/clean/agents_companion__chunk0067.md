## Figure 1. Relationship between DevOps, MLOps, and AgentOps.13

Each of these “Ops” requires capabilities like version control, automated deployments

through CI/CD, testing, logging, security and (critically) metrics. Each system often

implements some form of optimization based on metrics – measuring what your system

is and isn’t doing, measuring the outcomes and business metrics, and automating the

processes for more holistic metrics, and incrementally improving step by step. This practice

might be called “A/B experimentation” or “ML Ops” or “Metrics Driven development",

but they derive from the same general approach and we will rely on those principles for
