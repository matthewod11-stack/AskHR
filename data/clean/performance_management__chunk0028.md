Evaluations are also adversely affected by gender. Men are typically evaluated as more effective than women. That this ﬁnding reﬂects sex discrimination is suggested by that even when the males and the fact females demonstrate the same leadership behavior, women are devalued when the appraisers are male. A subsequent review of leadership perceptions in the military revealed preferential ratings for men in train- ing groups, primarily where there was a ‘‘token’’ woman; found in groups where there were several women. This suggests that token status exacerbates negative evaluations of women, because the token female receives considerable attention, which increases the pressure on her to per- form well.

Another study also points to the impor- tance of gender proportion as a factor affect- ing rating accuracy. The respondents, only 27 of whom were female, reported that men possess the motivation and leadership qua- lities necessary for effective performance, whereas women possess feminine attitudes that impair their performance. Yet, there were no performance differences between men and women on any objective measure. In still another study, the performance of women was rated higher than that of men when the women constituted a higher pro- portion than the men. Gender proportion appears to inﬂuence the performance evalua- tions of women. Increasing the representa- tion of women in mixed groups increases positive appraisals of them.

To minimize bias and increase the accu- racy and objectivity of coaches, training pro- grams should allow them to evaluate actors presented on videotape, receive feedback as to rating accuracy, and to practice, practice,

practice. Such training minimizes rating errors including leniency, halo, and simi- lar-to-me biases. This training should teach coaches: (1) the relevant performance criteria for evaluating people; (2) the relevant job behaviors to observe; and (3) and ways to effectively minimize errors in judgment when using the appraisal instrument.
