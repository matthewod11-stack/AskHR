## Linking Individual with Unit and Organizational Priorities

Obtain a copy of the job description for your current or most recent job. If this is not feasible, obtain a copy of a job de- scription of someone you know. Then, obtain a copy of the mission statements for the organization and unit in question.

Revise the job description so that it is aligned with the unit and organizational strategic priorities. Revisions may include adding tasks and KSAs important in the mis- sion statement that are not already included in the job description. (cid:2)
