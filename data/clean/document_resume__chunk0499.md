# Performance Appraisal

- 5. Although the behavior of workers or the tasks performed by them can appar- ently be described in an infinite number of ways, there are only a small number of definitive functions involved. thus, in interacting with machines, workers function to feed, tend, operate, or set up, and in the case of vehicles or related machines, to drive-control them. Although each of these functions occurs over a range of difficulty and content, essentially each draws on a relatively narrow and specific range of similar kinds and degrees of worker characteristics and qualifications for effective performance.

- 6. The functions appropriate to each primitive are hierarchical and ordinal, pro- ceeding from the simple to the complex. Thus, to indicate a particular func- tion, compiling (data), for example, as reflecting the requirements of a job is to say that it induces the requirements of lower functions such as comparing and excludes the requirement of higher functions such as analyzing.

- 7. The three hierarchies provide two measures for a job. Level is a measure of relative complexity in relation to things, to data, and to people. Orientation is a measure of relative (proportional) involvement with things, data, and people.

- 8. The hierarchies of functions reflect a progression from much prescription and little discretion in worker instruction at the least complex level to much dis- cretion and little prescription at the most complex level.

- 9. Human performance is conceived as involving three types of skills. adaptive, functional; and speufic content. Adaptive skills are those competencies that en ible an indiv idual to manage the demands for uniformity and/or change in relation to the physical, interpersonal, and organizational arrangements and conditions in which tilt job exists. Functional skills are those competencies that enable an individual to relate to things, data; and people (orientation) in some combination according to personal preferences and to come degree of complexity appropriate to abilities (level). Specific content skills ace those competencies that enable an individual to perform a specific job accor standards required to satisfy the market.iO

The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) ryas specifically designed to be a worker-oriented model. Developed by Ernest J. MLCormick and his associates at Purdue University, the PAQ is based on the following undeily mg assumption.

If there is some such underlying behavioral structure, such structure presum- ably would have to be characterized in terms of the ma mei in which more specific "units" of job-related variables tend to be organized au oss jobs. Thus, the "building blocks" or common denominators or any dimensional stricture must consist of relatively unitary, discrete job variables of some class that can be identified and quantified as they relate to individual jobs.11

1 inventory of "job elements" within major divisions and subdivisions is then proposed in the PAQ. Within these divisions the inventory of job elements serve as a basis for determining the behavioral dimensions of jobs. These dimensions include. (1)
