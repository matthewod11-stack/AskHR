# Deﬁnition of Productivity

Subjective well-being research paints a complex picture of the happy worker. A single employee could simultaneously experience high levels of positive affect, average levels of negative affect, and low levels of job or life satisfaction, and each of these components of well-being could have distinct implications for productivity. Un- fortunately, the complexities of research on the happy-productive worker do not end there. It is also clear that the outcome or crite- rion variable of interest, worker productivity, is multifaceted and complex. Productivity has been operationally deﬁned in a variety of ways, ranging from objective measures including worker output, efﬁciency, turnover, and absenteeism, to more subjective measures, including supervisor ratings. Many of these different measures of productivity and performance do not correlate very highly (Meyer & Gupta, 1995). In addition, some researchers have suggested that happiness and satisfaction are more likely to affect organizational citizenship behaviors than direct measures of productivity and that these citizenship behaviors may have important positive implica- tions for the organization (George & Brief, 1992).

As we shall see, different components of happiness and well- being are likely to inﬂuence these different forms of productivity
