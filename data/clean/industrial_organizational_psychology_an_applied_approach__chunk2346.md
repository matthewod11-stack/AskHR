## What Individual Diﬀ erences Aﬀ ect Job Satisfaction?

As shown in Figure ., one of the factors (called antecedents) that influence levels of job satisfaction and commitment is our personal predisposition to be satisfied. Going back to our examples at the beginning of the chapter, what would explain why David Spoto loves his current job and Rhonda Beall hates hers? According to theories involving individual differences, the key to the answer is the fact that David has been satisfied at every job he has had, whereas Rhonda has never been satisfied with a job. Individual difference theory postulates that some variability in job satisfaction is due to an individual’s personal tendency across situations to enjoy what she does. Thus, certain types of people will gener- ally be satisfied and motivated regardless of the type of job they hold. This idea also makes intuitive sense. We all know people who constantly complain and whine about every job they have, and we also know people who are motivated and enthusiastic about their every job or task.

For individual-difference theory to be true, it would be essential that job sat- isfaction be consistent across time and situations. Research seems to support this notion, as meta-analysis results indicate that the average correlation between job satisfaction levels, measured an average of three-years apart, is . (Dormann & Zapf, ).

Because there seems to be at least some consistency in job satisfaction across time and jobs, the next question concerns the types of people that seem to be consistently satisfied with their jobs. Research in this area has focused on genetic predispositions (Lykken & Tellegen, ), core self-evaluations (Judge, Locke, Durham, & Kluger, ), and life satisfaction (Tait, Padgett, & Baldwin, ).

Genetic Predispositions An interesting and controversial set of studies (Arvey, Bouchard, Segal, & Abraham, ; Arvey, McCall, Bouchard, Taubman, & Cavanaugh, ; Keller, Bouchard, Arvey, Segal, & Dawis, ) suggests that job satisfaction not only may be fairly stable across jobs but also may be genetically determined. Arvey and his colleagues arrived at this conclusion by comparing the levels of job satisfaction of  sets of identical twins who were separated from each other at an early age. If job satisfac- tion is purely environmental, there should be no significant correlation between levels of job satisfaction for identical twins who were raised in different environ- ments and who are now working at different types of jobs. But if identical twins have similar levels of job satisfaction despite being reared apart and despite work- ing at dissimilar jobs, then a genetic predisposition for job satisfaction is likely.

On the basis of their three studies, Arvey and his colleagues found that approximately % of job satisfaction appears to be explainable by genetic factors (Ilies & Judge, ). Such a finding does not of course mean that there is a “job satisfaction gene.” Instead, inherited personality traits such as negative affectiv- ity (the tendency to have negative emotions such as fear, hostility, and anger) are related to our tendency to be satisfied with jobs (Ilies & Judge, ).

What are the implications of these findings? It may be that some people will probably not be satisfied with any job, and supervisors should not lose sleep over the fact that these employees are not happy or motivated. Furthermore, one way to increase the overall level of job satisfaction in an organization would be to hire only those applicants who show high levels of overall job and life satisfaction. Because these findings are controversial and have received some criticism (Cropanzano & James, ), more research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.

Core Self-Evaluations Whether the consistency in job satisfaction is due to genetic or environmental fac- tors, a series of personality variables appear to be related to job satisfaction. That is, certain types of personalities are associated with the tendency to be satisfied or dissatisfied with one’s job. Judge, Locke, and Durham () have hypothe- sized that four personality variables are related to people’s predisposition to be satisfied with life and with their jobs: emotional stability, self-esteem, self-efficacy (perceived ability to master their environment), and external locus of control (perceived ability to control their environment). That is, people prone to be satis- fied with their jobs and with life in general have high self-esteem and a feeling of being competent, are emotionally stable, and believe they have control over their lives. This view is supported by several meta-analyses and studies:

As shown in Table ., a meta-analysis by Judge and Bono () found

these four variables to be related to both job satisfaction and job performance.

Judge, Locke, Durham, and Kluger () found a significant correlation between a combination of these four variables and job satisfaction (r = .) and life satisfaction (r = .). Meta-analyses by Connolly and Viswesvaran (), and by Bowling, Hendricks, and Wagner () indicate that overall job satisfaction, as well as different facets of job satisfaction, is related to affectivity. That is, people with a tendency to have positive emotions (positive affectivity) tend to be more satisfied with their jobs than do people with a tendency to have negative emotions (negative affectivity).
