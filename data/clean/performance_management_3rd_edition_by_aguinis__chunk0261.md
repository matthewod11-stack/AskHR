## Reality Check: Ideal versus Actual Performance Management System

The table here summarizes the key characteristics of an ideal performance management system as discussed in this chap- ter. Think about a performance management system you know. This could be the one implemented at your current (or most recent) job. If you don’t have information about such a system, talk to a friend or acquaintance who is currently working, and gather information about the system used in his or her organi- zation. Use the Y/N column in the table to indicate whether each of the features is present (Y: yes) or not (N: no) in the system you are considering. In some cases, some elements may be present to a matter of degree and may require that you include some additional information in the Comments column. Next, prepare a brief report addressing the following

- 1. How many of the 14 characteristics of an ideal system

are present in the system you are evaluating?

- 2. Identify two characteristics that are not present at all, or barely present, in your system. Discuss the implications that the lack of these characteristics has on the effectiveness of the system. Identify one characteristic that is clearly present in your system. Discuss the implications of the presence of this characteristic on the effectiveness of the system. Identify the characteristic in your system that is furthest from the ideal. What can be done to produce a better alignment between your system and the ideal? Who should be responsible for doing what so that your system becomes “ideal” regarding this characteristic?
