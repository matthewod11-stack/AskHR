ABSTRACT:

Employee turnover and retention are critical concerns for organizations of all sizes and industries. High turnover rates can lead to increased recruitment costs, reduced productivity, and a negative impact on employee morale. Therefore, it is essential for businesses to implement effective strategies to retain top talent. This includes creating a positive work environment, offering competitive compensation packages, providing opportunities for career development and advancement, and fostering open communication between management and employees. Moreover, understanding the root causes of turnover, such as job dissatisfaction or lack of work- life balance, is crucial for tailoring retention initiatives. By proactively addressing these issues and emphasizing employee engagement, organizations can reduce turnover, enhance their reputation as employers of choice, and ultimately achieve greater stability and success in the ever-competitive marketplace.
