Benefits and drawbacks of upward appraisal Numerous arguments appear in the literature concerning the advantages and disadvantages of upward appraisal. One of the primary benefits of including subordinates in the appraisal process is that it results in higher quality feedback (Wexley and Klimoski, 1984; Kane and Lawler, 1978). It is argued that subordinates are in the best position to evaluate a manager's performance for certain competencies, for example, leadership competencies. Cardy and Dobbins (1994, p. 159) suggest that ``no one is in a better position than subordinates to evaluate such dimensions as clarity of directions, performance feedback and sensitivity to the needs of the subordinates''. Bettenhausen and Fedor (1997) suggest that

upward appraisal can increase employee participation and enhance their sense of importance in the company. There is evidence that upward appraisal can encourage the focal individual to change his/ her workplace behaviour (Smither et al., 1995b; Hegarty, 1974). The use of subordinate appraisals can provide: more reliable ratings for certain performance dimensions such as leadership competence, improved employee performance as a result of receiving upward feedback and a more participatory organisational culture. However, despite such arguments supporting the adoption of upward appraisal, a number of problems exist.
