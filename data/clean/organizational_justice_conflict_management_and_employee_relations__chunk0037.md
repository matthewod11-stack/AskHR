2.1 Employee relations Tsui and Wang (2002, p. 78) defined ER as “the formal and informal, the economic, social, and psychological connection between an employee and his or her employer.” In the current scenario, promoting a cooperative and supportive work environment and conducive ER is in the paramount interest of both the organization and employees (Hopkins and Yonker, 2015). Organizations’ priority toward enhancing the well-being of employees has been considered relevant for the healthy employer–employee relations (Holtzhausen and Fourie, 2009). Thus, the inclination to build harmonious ER is crucial for employee engagement and organizational performance (Tansel and Gazioglu, 2014). It also stimulates employee motivation, loyalty and performance for achieving the best results for their organization.

2.2 Organizational justice It refers to the perceived fairness of organizational outcomes, procedures and interactions that bind all individuals to work collaboratively for developing a mutually beneficial relationship. Nadiri and Tanova (2010, p. 34) defined organizational justice as “individuals’ perception of fairness of treatment received from an organization and their behavioral reaction to such perceptions.” It is a tri-dimensional concept including distributive justice: the fair allocation of resources and rewards based on the efforts made, procedural justice: the fair process and procedures followed to make allocation decisions, and interactional justice that comprises of interpersonal justice denoting the interpersonal treatment individuals received by following fair procedures (Colquitt et al., 2001). Blader and Tyler (2003) suggested that when individuals are fairly evaluated it It also improves provides a cue about organizational commitment, job performance (Cropanzano et al., 2007; Colquitt et al., 2012; Ohana, 2014; Aryee et al., 2015) and mutual benefits (Loi et al., 2006).
