# concerns about the relationship.

- Spend time together outside work at least once a month to deepen

your trust and personal connection. This is especially important if

you work remotely. The deeper the connection, the easier it will be to

handle stressful situations. Respect boundaries to make sure there is

clarity around decision-making and to avoid stepping on toes.
