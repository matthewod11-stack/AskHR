# deliver bad news?

In the original article, I cite Bill Campbell, the legendary Silicon Valley

coach and executive. He’s since passed away. Two more recent examples

are Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital ﬁrm,

and Brian Chesky of Airbnb. Ben wrote a fantastic essay called “The Right Way to Lay People Oﬀ,” in which he describes doing three rounds

of cuts at a startup he led without poisoning the culture, which is

hard to do. When the pandemic began, Airbnb downsized 25% of its

employees. Brian’s approach, starting with his memo announcing the move, was a textbook case of oﬀering predictability, understanding,

control, and compassion. He explained exactly why they were doing

it. He let everyone keep their company laptops for job hunting. He

gave generous severance and immediate vesting of stock options. He let

departing employees stay for a few days to say goodbye to colleagues

and wrap things up. You’d be amazed how many well-run companies still cut oﬀ people’s email immediately. It’s like they try to disappear you

into the vapor. That creates a lack of control—and it doesn’t make sense.
