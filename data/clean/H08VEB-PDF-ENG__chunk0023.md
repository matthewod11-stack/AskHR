# things, too.

When people feel safe naming what’s real, it beneﬁts their health, team

performance, and the culture you’re trying to build.

The best leaders don’t hide their emotions or overlook others’. They

notice, name, get curious, and normalize them. The more you value

and explore emotions, the healthier, more resilient, and eﬀective you

will become. And as AI takes on more technical tasks, your ability to

navigate the emotional will set you apart. Emotions aren’t a weakness;

they’re your most powerful leadership advantage.
