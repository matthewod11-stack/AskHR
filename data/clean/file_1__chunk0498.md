and Farh (1999) have come to a conclusion that although men and women are similarly concerned about procedural justice, women appear to show higher organizational commitment and trust in supervisors than men. Since the results of the studies addressing the gender differences in reactions to injustice are inconsistent, further investigation is needed to shed light on the possible moderating effect of gender on the relationships between procedural justice and work-related attitudes and behaviours such as organizational commitment.

All in all, as Colquitt and Greenberg (2003) have mentioned, organizational justice is ‘a promising young adult’ who has more room to grow and mature. In this study we aim at broadening the organizational justice literature by addressing the inconsistency in the studies’ results concerning the impact of gender on the relationships between pay inequity, perceptions of procedural justice, and organizational commitment. By integrating social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) and the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999) with equity and procedural justice theory, the current study aims at broadening the knowledge about the role of gender in reactions to organizational injustice. We discuss why even though female employees tend to earn less than their comparable male counterparts, they often continue to be committed to their organizations to the same or even greater extent than their male colleagues. The study is conducted in Finland, a country that shares with other Nordic countries a culture with relatively high standards for social justice and gender equality (see Scales of Justice, 2011; Corporate Gender Gap Report, 2010; Global Gender Gap Report, 2010).
