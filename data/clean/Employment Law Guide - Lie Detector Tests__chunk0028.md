Where polygraph examinations are allowed, they are subject to strict standards for the conduct of the test,

including the pretest, testing, and post testing phases. An examiner must be licensed if required by a state in

which the test is to be conducted, and must be bonded or have professional liability coverage. The Act strictly

limits the disclosure of information obtained during a polygraph test.
