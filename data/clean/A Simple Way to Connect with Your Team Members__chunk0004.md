Manager-employee relationships are particularly important.

Research shows that when employees get along with their bosses,they’re more motivated and productive, while those who don’t aremore likely to perform poorly. These relationship dynamics caneven impact an employee’s

health.Traditionally, managers have been able to build relationshipswith their direct reports in person. But those days are gone. Fifty-eight percent of 25,000 Americans

surveyed by McKinsey saidthey have the option to work from home at least one day a week,and 35% are permitted to do so full-time. What’s more, whenpeople are allowed to work flexibly, 87% of them do. This meansthat managers, new and seasoned, need to find new ways toconnect with their teams — not just on a professional level, but ona personal one as well.As the chief revenue officer at my organization, I used to count ontraveling to our offices to build these connections. During thepandemic when work travel came to a halt, I needed to find a newway to avoid “ivory tower syndrome.” When leaders come acrossas too busy and are unreachable to their employees, people don’tcome to them with the problems that need to be solved — andthose problems fester.Through trial and error, I developed a video meeting system that’shelped me sustain meaningful relationships with my teammembers. I’ve received positive feedback from participants aboutthe value these spaces provide.
