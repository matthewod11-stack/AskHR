It is particularly important that leaders are vocal in their commitment

to the organization’s values and unwavering in upholding them. When

bad behavior is not addressed, it can become contagious; very quickly,

the organization’s values erode and toxicity takes over. For people to

feel safe raising issues, they must understand the rules and trust that

those rules will be applied fairly and transparently.

It’s been two years since the coronavirus began its sweep across the

globe. As vaccines are more widely available, its grip on the way

we work is loosening. The employees who return to the office have

changed, though. The Great Resignation has shown that employees

have different expectations of their organizations than they did a few

years ago. They desire purpose and connection, and they want to be

seen. The organization that shows through its actions that it cares for its

employees beyond the short-term profit they generate, that shows a real

interest in who they are and supports them in good times and bad, will

earn loyalty, engagement, and trust — and will deserve it.

It may not be possible to predict or avoid the next crisis our

organizations will face. However, with forethought, planning, and

commitment, we can be prepared to meet the next challenge —

whatever it may be — and come through it stronger.
