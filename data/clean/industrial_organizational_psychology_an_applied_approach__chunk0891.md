# Chapter Summary

In this chapter you learned: 7 7

Discrimination complaints are filed with the EEOC. A variety of federal laws forbid discrimination based on sex (male, fe- male), race (African American, European American, Asian Ameri- can, Native American), national origin, color, religion, disabil- ity, age (over ), pregnancy, and Vietnam-era veteran status. The legality of an employment practice is determined by such factors as the presence of adverse impact and the job relatedness of the employment practice. Adverse impact is usually determined by the four-fifths rule. Affirmative action consists of a variety of strategies, such as inten- tional recruitment of minority applicants, identification and re- moval of employment practices working against minority appli- cants and employees, and preferential hiring and promotion. Employers need to be cautious about violating employee pri- vacy rights regarding drug testing, office and locker search- es, psychological testing, and electronic surveillance. Organizations can be held liable for the sexual harassment of their employees. This harassment can take the form of quid pro quo or a hostile environment.
