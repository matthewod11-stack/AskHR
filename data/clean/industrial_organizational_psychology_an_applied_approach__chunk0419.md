## Ethics in Industrial/Organizational Psychology

Organizations and employees are faced with ethical dilemmas every day. Ethical dilemmas are ambiguous situations that require a personal judgment of what is right or wrong because there are no rules, policies, or laws guiding such decisions. Individuals often rely on their morals and personal values, which often leads to different decisions by different people in similar situations. Because people have different backgrounds which impact their personal values and how they define a particular situation, the decision that one person makes may be very different than what another one makes.

For example, suppose you want to sell your car. You know that your car has been in several accidents and has had a lot of work done on it. Do you share that information with a prospective buyer? There is no law or policy that says you must. In fact, most people would say that unless the buyer specifically asks you that question you shouldn’t bring it up at all. Is it morally wrong or unfair not to share this information? Based on an individual’s value system, the answer may be “yes”, it is morally wrong, or “no”, it’s not morally wrong.

In life, we often encounter two types of ethical dilemmas: Type A and Type B. In a Type A dilemma, there is a high level of uncertainty as to what is right or wrong, there appears to be no best solution, and there are both positive and negative consequences to a decision. For example, many people would say that drug research that uses animals to test new drugs is unethical, because it is morally wrong to hurt any living creature. Others would say that new drugs could save millions of lives and that it would be morally wrong not to make and test drugs that could potentially save human lives. As you can see, there seems to be no one best answer, as there are both negative and positive consequences in making this decision.

In a Type B dilemma, also called rationalizing dilemmas, the difference between right and wrong is much clearer than in a Type A dilemma. Usually, individuals know what is right but choose the solution that is most advantageous to themselves. For example, choosing not to tell a prospective buyer about any past damage that occurred with a car for sale would have the most advantages for the seller. Type B dilemmas are called rationalizing dilemmas because individu- als “rationalize” they are right because “everyone else does it.” For example, many students will say that they have cheated at least one time on a test. Most of those students would agree that it is morally wrong to cheat. So why have so many done it? They rationalize that “for just this one time” it is okay and that it is not hurting anyone. And they convince themselves that because everyone else is doing it, it must be okay. This ability to rationalize is why unethical behavior is at an all-time high in organizations. In a survey done by Careerbuilder.com () of , workers, % of them reported participating in the unethical act of lying in the workplace at some point in their professional career. In a survey by the Ethics Resource Center in , % of workers surveyed reported witnessing unethical behavior from others, including such things as “borrowing” work supplies and taking them home, stealing pencils and other equipment, using sick leave when they weren’t sick, abuse of employees by management, and coming in late and leaving early.

At the end of each chapter in this textbook, you will be presented with some ethical dilemmas for which you are asked to discuss and answer questions. Using the information from this section, decide whether you think those situations are
