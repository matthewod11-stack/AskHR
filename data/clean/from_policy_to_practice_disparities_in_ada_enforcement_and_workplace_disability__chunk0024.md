Likewise, EEOC v. Ford Motor Co. (2015), in which the Sixth Circuit Court found that regular attendance was an important job requirement and that telecommuting could be viewed as an unreasonable accommodation that depends on the requirements of the job. The decision raised the issue of changing norms in the workplace, particularly in the face of the response to the remote employment of disabled workers. In the case of U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett (2002), the Supreme Court stated that no employer should breach a seniority system to allow a disabled person to work unless an exceptional case occurs. This was a case of a conflict between personal accommodation and firm-wide policies. Such cases have shown federal courts play a huge role in the ADA enforcement in a way that balances between disability rights and business practices. Nevertheless, circuit splitting and dynamic changes that occur in the work environment still bring legal ambiguity, which leads to the inability to consistently apply the technical provisions of the ADA. 3.3 Trends in EEOC Complaints and Resolutions The EEOC statistics over the last 20 years show the same trend in ADA employment complaints. Between 2010 and 2023, disability-based discrimination regularly occupied one of the first five places in the list of causes leading to the filed charges with the EEOC, sometimes reaching the proportion of more than 30 percent of all discrimination complaints. The most commonly cited issues in ADA complaints include (West et al., 2023):

- (cid:32) Failure to provide reasonable accommodations (cid:32) Unlawful discharge or demotion (cid:32) Harassment based on disability (cid:32) Hiring discrimination (cid:32) Retaliation for asserting ADA rights

The results of the resolution differ. Of the charges filed against employers with the EEOC in FY 2022 relating to ADA, a total of 22,000-plus charges were reported. Of those, about 18 percent were settled via merit-based resolution, about 10 percent were conciliated through the EEOC, and fewer than 2 percent went to court. A very large preponderance was closed without a determination of discrimination, possibly indicating a limitation on investigations as well as on the evidence presented by complainants. Noticeably, being less frequent, systemic, and class-wide investigations can easily result in very effective outcomes. To give an example, there is an EEOC v. In 2021, in the context of a nationwide investigation, the company is reported to have settled a claim of about 6 million dollars and to have changed its policies to a mutually agreed settlement (Dollar General, 2021). What is more, complaint trends demonstrate state-to-state differences. States like California, Texas, and Florida report larger amounts of ADA-related charges partly because the universe of their population is higher and due to more active legal advocacy organizations. Nonetheless, the volume is not always associated with positive results, which indicates the non-equilibrium in legal assistance and enforcement resources at the level of states.
