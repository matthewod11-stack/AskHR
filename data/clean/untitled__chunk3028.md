# Other Regional Meetings

Since 1995, regional congresses of psychology have been held, primarily in developing areas of the world, under the cosponsorship of the IUPsyS and the IAAP. These con- gresses usually do not involve permanent regional organi- zations; rather, the host country organizes them, and most participants come from the surrounding region, although psy- chologists from other regions are welcome to register and

attend. These regional meetings are especially important for younger psychologists and colleagues from less developed countries who may not be able to afford the travel costs and registration fees for world congresses. Regional congresses have been held in Guangzhou, China (1995), Mexico City, Mexico (1997), Durban, South Africa (1999) and Mumbai, India (2001).
