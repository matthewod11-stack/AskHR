## The European Federation of Professional Psychology Associations

Like the IUPsyS, the European Federation of Professional Psychology Associations (EFPPA) restricts its membership to national psychological associations, with only one associ- ation per country permitted to hold membership. The EFPPA was founded in 1981 and reﬂects the changes in Europe as its countries move toward political and economic unity.

Twelve national psychology associations held charter membership in the EFPPA. In 2000, that number had grown to 30 member nations, whose associations represented over 100,000 individual psychologists. Professional issues such as training, curricula, ethics, and professional regulation have historically been the principal focus of the EFPPA, but the as- sociation considers the integration of practice and research to be an indispensable goal for European psychology.

Acentral focus of the EFPPAhas been the development of Europe-wide training standards for psychologists. This focus reﬂected the political directives of the European Community that encouraged professions in member states to develop common standards. In psychology, this move eventuated in the adoption in 1990 of formal guidelines under the rubric “Optimal Standards for Training.” The goal of the EFPPA at the end of the twentieth century was to develop a formal framework that would lead to a European Diploma for Psy- chologists (Lunt, 1996, 2000).

The EFPPA has held biennial assemblies since 1982. In 1996, the association began sponsoring publication of the European Psychologist, which was a primary means of com- munication among its members.
