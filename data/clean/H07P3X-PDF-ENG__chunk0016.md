# Make Calls During Your Commute

If you commute into the oﬃce or travel for business, some of your

travel times could oﬀer an ideal opportunity to catch up in an informal

manner with colleagues. One of my clients who was an executive with

a packed meeting schedule used his drive home to reach out and have

informal conversations with his leaders. This helped him get a more

personal view on their thoughts and concerns, as the company was

going through a major transition.

When you’re on the road, you can call from airports, Ubers, or hotels

or send messages when you’re waiting in lines or on trains. Even a

ﬁve- to 10-minute conversation can increase your rapport and, most

importantly, show that you care.
