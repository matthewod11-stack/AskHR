We’ve all been told the importance of ﬁnding a mentor as you build

your career. Among other beneﬁts, it can lead to higher job satisfaction

and better professional prospects. According to one report, employees

who had mentors were promoted ﬁve times more often than people who

did not. But the truth is that senior leaders with the time and interest

to support you are in short supply, so it can be hard to know where to

start. If you don’t already have a mentor, how can you actually get the

guidance you need?
