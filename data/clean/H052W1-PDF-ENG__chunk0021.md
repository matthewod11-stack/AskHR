# Do:

- Resist taking your emotional temperature during your ﬁrst few weeks

back on the job. Returning to work after parental leave is a process.

- Make your schedule as predictable as possible and communicate your

plans to your colleagues. But understand that adjustments may be

needed along the way.

- Seek out support and encouragement from other parents at work.
