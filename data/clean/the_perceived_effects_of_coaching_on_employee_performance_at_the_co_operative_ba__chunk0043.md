## development sessions where an experienced employee with considerable expertise

guides a trainee. Since coaching takes place on a one- to-one basis, it provides a

more intense training and learning experience customized to the specific needs of

the individual. It is a more formal and regulated method of passing on expertise

through on- the-job training and hence coaches have to be specially selected and

trained to train so as to pass on their skills and knowledge effectively. The main

reasons organizations use coaching are to improve individual performance, deal

with under-performance and improve productivity. The key features of coaching as

highlighted by Robinson (2006) are; coaching is a relatively short-term activity, it

is time bound, it focuses on improving performance and developing individual skills,

coaching works on the premise that employees are self-aware and do not need

clinical intervention among others. Coaching is a widespread tool but there is a lack

of established standards, professional bodies and qualification frameworks.

As it applies to the workplace, however, coaching is a much more recent

development. There has been individualized training in the form of apprenticeships

for hundreds of years, but the earliest form of such coaching as we know it today

was called “developmental counseling” (Flory, 1965). Kampa-Kokesch and

Anderson (2001) report that from 1940 to 1979, coaching tended to be performed

by organization consultants. During this initial period, coaches were primarily

psychologists and organization development (OD) professionals who were focused

on OD issues. There was often an informal aspect to it.

From 1980 to 1994, the field of coaching experienced rapid growth, quickly

expanding into many new areas of service (life coaching, outplacement, career

coaching, etc.). According to Hudson (1999), the field was accelerated by

complexities associated with increased downsizing, mergers, acquisitions, and

outplacement. The leader’s role evolved to deal with rising levels of ambiguity and

pressures to perform in an increasingly global context. Top managers were asked to

be both strategic decision makers and masters of the “soft” skills required to

effectively manage people (Sherman & Freas, 2004). From 1995 to the present, the

amount of executive and workforce coaching has continued to grow. There has been

an increase in the number of publications devoted to coaching, in organizations that

offer training to coaches, in the establishment of coaching organizations, and in the

focus placed on coaching research by academia.
