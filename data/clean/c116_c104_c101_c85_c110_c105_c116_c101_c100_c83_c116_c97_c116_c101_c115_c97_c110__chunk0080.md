# A. DISPUTE PATTERN DIFFERENCES

Disputes can arise prior to the termination itself and continue after the termination. Disputes may take the form of lawsuits threatened, lawsuits filed, and lawsuits litigated. At each phase of the termination process, PCO Canada and PCO U.S. incur different levels of disputing. According to PCO's detailed records, as a percentage of all employees, there was a higher percentage of ``separations'' (when an employee leaves PCO for any reason Â± termination, resignation, or retirement) in Canada than in the United States in the years studied, but the rates of ``forced separations'' (meaning the employee was fired) to all separations was similar in the two countries. As Table 2 shows, in the fiscal year studied, 24.1 percent of total separations in Canada were forced; in United States, 23.4 percent of total separations were forced. In Canada, 35.7 percent of those who were fired were first placed on formal probation. In the United States, on the other hand, only 9.1 percent of those who were fired were first placed on probation.
