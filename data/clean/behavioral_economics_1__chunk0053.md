# C. Field studies

Many new studies look for the influences of rationality limits in naturally-occurring field data. A good

example that highlights interest in time preference is Della Vigna and Malmendier’s (2005) study of health club

memberships. The health clubs they study allow people to spend a fixed sum for an annual membership, or pay

for each visit separately. People who discount hyperbolically, but are “naïve” about their future hyperbolic

preferences, will sign up for large-fee annual plans with per-visit fees that are below marginal cost (typically

25

free). They find that even though per-visit fees average $10, the typical consumer who bought the annual-fee

package ended up going rarely enough that the per-visit cost was $19. They also show theoretically that this

contract is optimal for firms: Naïve hyperbolics like it because they misforecast how often they will go (they

don’t realize they are choosing a suboptimal contract), and “sophisticated” hyperbolic consumers like it because

the low per-visit fee provides external self-control (which they know they will need).

An early example of a field study inspired by behavioral economics is Camerer, Babcock, Loewenstein

and Thaler’s (1997) study of cab driver labor supply. New York City cab drivers typically rent their cabs by the

day, for a fixed fee, keep all the revenues they earn, and can drive up to 12 hours. The standard theory of

upward-sloping labor supply, and intertemporal substitution, predicts that drivers will drive longer on high-

wage days. But suppose drivers take a short horizon, e.g., one day at a time, and have an aspiration level or

reference point they dislike falling short of (i.e., they are averse to a perceived revenue “loss” relative to their

reference point or daily target). Myopic target-driven drivers will drive more hours on low-wage days, the

opposite of the standard prediction. (This is a case where behavioral economics made a clear prediction of a

new phenomenon, rather than just explaining an established anomaly.) Camerer et al found that inexperienced

drivers appear to have a negative labor supply elasticity—they drove more hours on low-wage days—and the

elasticity of experienced drivers was around zero. Farber (2004) replicated this study with a smaller fresh

sample using a hazard rate model of hourly quitting decisions. He found no evidence of daily targeting in

general and weak evidence for three of five drivers for whom there are a lot of data. A subsequent study

(Farber, 2005) finds effects of targeting which are significant but small in magnitude.

Conlin, O’Donoghue and Vogelsang (2005) estimate how often items ordered from mail-order

catalogues are returned. Their study is motivated by evidence of “projection bias”—the idea that one’s current

emotional state exerts too much influence on a projection of one’s future state (e.g., people buy more groceries

when they are hungry). They show theoretically that returns of cold-weather items (e.g., jackets or gloves) on a

26

particular day depend on whether the return-day weather is warm, and also depend on weather the ordering-day

weather was cold. (The intuition is that people who order on a cold day mistakenly forecast it will be equally

cold in the future, so they are systematically surprised.) Their result is striking because people are well aware of

seasonality in weather (most people can tell you whether a day is unseasonably warm or cold). It is not as they

are misforecasting their tastes for exotic novelties like sea urchin or funnypunk music.

A booming and important area of field study is experimentation in field settings. Field experiments can

range (Harrison and List, 2004) from abstract simple experiments done outside university labs, to measurement

of treatment effects in field sites where those effects are of special interest (see Cardenas and Carpenter, 2005).

These studies combine the value of measuring an effect directly in a population of interest with the gain from

experimental control. The gain comes from randomized assignment of treatments, which avoids self-selection

effects that are challenging to control econometrically in field data.16
