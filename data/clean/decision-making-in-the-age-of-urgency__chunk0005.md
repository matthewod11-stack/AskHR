4 That is, a financial return of 20 percent or more from the most recent big-bet or cross-cutting decision at respondents’ organizations. We

measured market outperformance as the rate of revenue growth in the past three years, relative to peers, and for respondents who answered for big-bet or cross-cutting decisions, the average financial returns from their organizations’ decisions of that type.

Decision making in the age of urgency

The state of play of organizational decision making Consistent with our earlier work,5 the survey results confirm that not all decisions are created equal; different types of decisions require different approaches. We asked about three decision types in particular: big-bet, cross-cutting, and delegated decisions.6 Big bets are infrequent and high-stakes decisions, often with the potential to shape the company’s future—for example, acquisitions and annual resource allocation. Cross-cutting deci- sions, like big bets, are broad in scope, but they are more frequent and familiar. They consist of a series of smaller, interconnected decisions made

by different groups in the company as part of a collaborative, end-to-end decision process, as with a pricing decision. Finally, delegated decisions are frequent decisions that are much narrower in scope, such as changes to HR policy. These decisions are effectively handled by a single individual or working team made accountable for the decision, and they usually require limited input from others.

Only 30 percent of all respondents report familiarity with all three decision types. Among the three, respondents report the greatest exposure to cross- cutting decisions and the least exposure to big-bet decisions (Exhibit 1).
