# Research Designs for Evaluation

There are many ways to evaluate the effectiveness of a training program, and two factors differentiate the various methods. The first involves practicality, and the sec- ond is concerned with experimental rigor. Although scientifically rigorous research designs are preferred, their use is not always possible. Yet a practical research design without scientific rigor yields little confidence in research findings.

The most simple and practical of research designs implements a training pro- gram and then determines whether significant change is seen in performance of job knowledge. To use this method, performance or job knowledge must be measured twice. The first measurement, a pretest, is taken before the implementation of training. The second measurement, a posttest, is taken after the training program is complete. A diagram of this simple pretestâ€“posttest design is as follows:
