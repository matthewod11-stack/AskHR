# Figure 2.2 Example of PAQ questions

the level of analysis is fairly general. Th at is, the PAQ tells us if a job involves interviewing but does not indicate the type of interviewing that is performed (interviewing job applicants vs. interviewing a witness to a crime) or how the interview is conducted. Th us, the results would be diﬃ cult to use for functions such as training or performance appraisal.

Th e PAQ oﬀ ers many advantages. It is inexpensive and takes relatively little time to use. It is one of the most standardized job analysis methods, has accept- able levels of reliability, and its results for a particular position can be compared through computer analysis with thousands of other positions.

Although the PAQ has considerable support, research indicates its strengths are also the source of its weaknesses. Th e PAQ’s instructions suggest that incum- bents using the questionnaire have education levels between grades  and . Research has found, however, that the PAQ questions and directions are written at the college graduate level (Ash & Edgell, ); thus, many workers may not be able to understand the PAQ. Th is is one reason developers of the PAQ rec- ommend that trained job analysts complete the PAQ rather than the employees themselves.

In addition, the PAQ was designed to cover all jobs; but limited to  ques- tions and six dimensions, it has not proven very sensitive. For example, a home- maker and a police oﬃ cer have similar PAQ proﬁ les (Arvey & Begalla, ). Similar proﬁ les also are obtained regardless of whether an analyst actually observes the job or just looks at a job title or a job description (Brannick, Levine, & Morgeson, ).

Finally, having a large amount of information about a job yields the same results as having little information (Surrette et al., ). Although these studies speak favorably about the reliability of the PAQ, they also provide cause for worry because the PAQ appears to yield the same results regardless of how familiar the analyst is with a job.

Job Structure Profi le. A revised version of the PAQ was developed by Patrick and Moore (). Th e major changes in the revision, which is called the Job Structure Proﬁ le (JSP), include item content and style, new items to increase the discrimina- tory power of the intellectual and decision-making dimensions, and an emphasis on having a job analyst, rather than the incumbent, use the JSP. Research by JSP’s developers indicates that the instrument is reliable, but further research is needed before it is known whether the JSP is a legitimate improvement on the PAQ.

Job Elements Inventory. Another instrument designed as an alternative to the PAQ is the Job Elements Inventory (JEI), developed by Cornelius and Hakel (). Th e JEI contains  items and has a readability level appropriate for an employee with only a tenth-grade education (Cornelius, Hakel, & Sackett, ). Research comparing the JEI with the PAQ indicates that the scores from each method are very similar (Harvey, Friedman, Hakel, & Cornelius, ); thus, the JEI may be a better replacement for the diﬃ cult-to-read PAQ. But as mentioned with the JSP, much more research is needed before conclusions can be conﬁ - dently drawn.

Functional Job Analysis. Functional Job Analysis (FJA) was designed by Fine () as a quick method that could be used by the federal government to analyze and compare thousands of jobs. Jobs analyzed by FJA are broken down into the percentage of time the incumbent spends on three functions: data (information and ideas), people (clients, customers, and coworkers), and things (machines, tools, and equipment). An analyst is given  points to allot to the three functions. Th e points are usually assigned in multiples of , with each function receiving a minimum of  points. Once the points have been assigned, the high- est level at which the job incumbent functions is then chosen from the chart shown in Table ..
