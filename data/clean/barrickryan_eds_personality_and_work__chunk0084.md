## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 3

used to distinguish one human being from another. In follow-up work, Norman (1967) judged that over thirty-ﬁve hundred of these terms refer to stable personality traits. Clearly, no single compre- hensive model can capture all possible personality attributes. We must economize and reduce, seeking a more parsimonious sum- mary of this vast domain of concepts.

In the ﬁeld of biology, taxonomies have helped in organizing a huge number of species into a single framework indicating how each is related to the others. Correspondingly, in the ﬁeld of per- sonality, there has been a rising wave of interest in the search for a scientiﬁcally compelling taxonomy of the huge number of per- sonality attributes. A taxonomy is a systematic division of phe- nomena into ordered groups or categories; in other words, it is a way of “chunking” things. A scientiﬁc taxonomy helps organize and integrate knowledge and research ﬁndings by providing a standard scientiﬁc nomenclature. Such a nomenclature facilitates commu- nication among investigators and aids in the accumulation of em- pirical ﬁndings. Identifying a widely useful taxonomy of personality attributes is one of the most important goals of basic research in personality.

A central question in taxonomy construction concerns the pro- cedures to be used to divide or group the phenomena under study. A variety of approaches might be employed, but the most useful is a class of statistical methods generically referred to as factor analy- sis. As Goldberg and Digman (1994) noted, factor analysis can be considered a variable-reduction procedure in which many variables are organized by a few factors that summarize the interrelations among the variables. These factors can be thought of as summary constructs, or as higher-level dimensions in a hierarchical model of the variables in the domain.

Anyone seeking to employ factor analysis must ﬁrst make a cru- cial determination: which variables to include in the analysis. If some theory were available—one that was formulated clearly enough to specify the particular variables that should be measured—an in- vestigator might rely on that theory for variable selection, as several investigators have proposed (Cloninger, 1987; Eysenck, 1991). This could lead to an advantageous linking of the taxonomic model with a scientiﬁc theory. Even failures to verify the model in empirical studies could lead to important advances in the development of the
