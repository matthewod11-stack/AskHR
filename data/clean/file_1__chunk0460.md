responsibilities such as aging parents. Furthermore, older individuals are more aware of the cases where financial rewards are different for women and men who perform similarly (Judge and Livingston, 2008). Accordingly, older individuals are expected to perceive the gender pay gap to a greater extent than younger ones.

Proposition 5: younger individuals will perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than older individuals.

Marital status: marital status of an individual should also be taken into account when analysing individuals’ perceptions of the gender pay gap. Relative deprivation theory (Crosby, 1982) might be useful in understanding why the gender pay gap is not necessarily perceived with the same importance by married individuals as by unmarried ones. According to the theory, married individuals differ in the relative value they place on the various outcomes and characteristics of their marriages. In many cases, employers may believe that female married employees are supported financially by their spouses, and this, in turn, may be used to legitimate offering them lower salaries (Winslow-Bowe, 2009). In contrast, male married employees are likely to be given greater responsibility, promotion, relocation opportunities, and salaries based on the assumption that they have families to care of (Winslow-Bowe, 2009). In other words, if a wife's salary is believed to be a secondary income and a husband is expected to earn more than a wife, then it is not uncommon that both members of a family consider that husband's salary should be higher than wife's. Consequently, marital status is expected to have an impact on individuals’ perceptions of the gender pay gap in the way that a married individual will perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than an unmarried one.

Proposition 6: married individuals will perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than unmarried individuals.

Education: individuals, who are more highly educated or who hold more cognitive ability or both are likely to be more critical of the traditional labour segregation where women' work is considered to be less financially valuable than men's. It may happen so because these individuals have a tendency to adjust their attitudes on the basis of evidence they come across rather than based on historical norms (Judge and Livingston, 2008). Accordingly, those individuals who have high education are more likely to have learnt about gender inequalities and about the gender pay gap in particular. Individuals with higher education are thus expected to perceive the gender pay gap to a greater extent than individuals with lower education.

Proposition 7: individuals with higher education will perceive the gender pay gap to a greater extent than individuals with lower education.
