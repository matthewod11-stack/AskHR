Despite signs of economic recovery, including lower inﬂation rates and

sustained low unemployment, the start of 2024 has already seen a surge

in layoﬀs, surpassing 10,000 within the tech industry alone at the time

of writing. Macy’s, Wayfair, Ford, and Citigroup are among the other

companies who have already announced layoﬀs this year. This leaves

many workers in a state of uncertainty, waiting to ﬁnd out if they’re next

to be cut.
