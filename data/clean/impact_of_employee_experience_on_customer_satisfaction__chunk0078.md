# a) Physical Environment

The key element of the physical environment is workplace design and it

contributes to 30% of employee experience. According to Jacob Morgan

physical space matters and includes everything from company design of

offices, meals that the company offers, coffee break areas, organization

values and, of growing importance today, workplace flexibility: providing

the opportunity to work from home.
