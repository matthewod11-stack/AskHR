## Feminist Clinical and Counseling Practice

As we have noted, feminists have situated women’s problems and strengths within the context of the larger social, political, and cultural forces surrounding them. Today, clinicians work under strong conservative pressures from pharmaceutical companies, managed-care companies, and a biologically ori- ented psychiatric profession. Among other things, they press to redeﬁne psychological disorders as biological aberrations to be controlled by medication. Although feminists are not against the use of medication, this medicalized framework is diametrically opposed to the feminist emphasis on the social context. Thus far, organized psychology’s responses to con- servative pressures and corporate interests have fallen short of what feminists would wish.
