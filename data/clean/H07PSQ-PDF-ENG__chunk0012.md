other initiatives or commitments? Answering these questions reduces

the opportunity for the person to claim they didn’t know what you

wanted.

Once you’re aligned on the purpose of the work, you can paint a picture

of what good, bad, and unacceptable outcomes would look like. But

unfortunately, this is another step managers commonly skip. I refer to

it as the Valentine’s Day eﬀect; failing to articulate what you want and

being disappointed when the person doesn’t deliver. And in the case of

an employee you’re already leery of, failing to deﬁne your expectations

is almost certainly setting yourself up for disappointment. To provide a

rubric for their work, describe the minimum standard. What would you

consider a home run? What outcomes would be worrisome or would you

see as a failure? Answering these questions eliminates the possibility

that the person will pass oﬀ shoddy work as “good enough.”

When you make the goals clear, you remove the alignment excuses.
