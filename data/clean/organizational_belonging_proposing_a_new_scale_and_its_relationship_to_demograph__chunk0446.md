an overall F value, and the Adjusted Variance (R2) for shrinkage are reported.

Five demographic variables were entered first for explaining Productivity: Gender, Race, Age, Political Scale and Religion. Collectively, these variables did not explain a significant amount of Productivity variance, R2 ¼ 0.02, F(5, 114) ¼ 0.40, p ¼ .85. One variable, Political Scale, was marginally sig- nificant, b¼0.10, t(118) ¼ 1.79, p < .08, such that liberals perceived higher Productivity. In the second step, two Organization variables were added, Organization Tenure and Position Level/Role. Collectively, these variables explained a non-significant additional proportion of Productivity variance, R2 ¼ 0.01, and the overall F(7, 112) ¼ 0.42, p ¼ .88. One variable, Position Level/Role, was marginally significant, b¼0.19, t(118) ¼ 1.84, p < .07, such that non-management respondents perceived themselves as more product- ive. Finally, in the third step, all four OB scales were entered separately. Collectively, the Productivity variance, R2 ¼ 0.25, with an overall F(11, 108) ¼ 3.88, p < .01. Be Myself had a significant positive impact on Productivity, b¼0.31, t(118) ¼ 2.96, p < .01, such that higher perceptions led to higher Productivity. The model explained 28% of the Productivity variance, and 21% adjusted for shrinkage.
