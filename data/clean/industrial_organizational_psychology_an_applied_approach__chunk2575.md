Picture the following situations:

A male employee cannot understand why he was reprimanded for referring to female employees as the “girls in the office.” A supervisor has tried everything to communicate with her employees, but they still seem lost. Customers don’t like Sheila because she appears cold and aloof, although she is actually a very caring person. A supervisor is frustrated because her employees never read the notices posted on the bulletin board in the break room.
