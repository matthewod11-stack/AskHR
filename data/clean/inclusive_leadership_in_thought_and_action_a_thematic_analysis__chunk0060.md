respondents described engaging in behaviors to reduce communication barriers, facilitate open communication, and provide everyone with an op- portunity to provide input. Themes related to allocating time to demonstrate inclusiveness through various approaches, such as one-on-one staff meetings or team review and feedback sessions, also emerged. Based on a hierarchy chart of these second-order themes, our third coder was able to collapse them into four distant aggregate themes: communication, diverse human resource management, person-role Ô¨Åt, and agency. The derivation of these aggregate themes is presented in Figure 2.
