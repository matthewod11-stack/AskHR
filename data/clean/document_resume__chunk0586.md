# COMMUnication Factors

are sources of fun'ity experienced by appraisers, self-efficacy and outcome expecta- tions.21 Appraisers who believe they cannot do what is iequired of them (low self-effi- cacy) experience feelings of futility because they do not believe the environment will be responsive to their efforts, they have poor outcome expectations In either Lase belief systems of communicators can interfere with communication.

Attitudes are as potent as beliefs in creating LommumLation difficulties. Supervi- sors communicate a certain attitude when they confer with supervisees only on their own turf rather than in the supery isee's workplace or a neutral setting. Communication across the physical barrier of a supervisor's desk does not improve understanding.22 Figure 5.3 is an attempt to depict some of the multiple human factors that are constantly affecting the flow of messages between two persons. Again, the appraiser must assume primary responsibility for recognizing the impact of these factors and in reducing any negative impact they have in communicating with appraisers.
