# Composition of compensation, by industry

Variable vs. Fixed Direct compensation is made up of a ﬁxed base salary (paid in cash) and incentives contingent upon achieving certain goals.

Long-term vs. Short-term Incentives may be paid the year goals are achieved or deferred and paid over several years. Companies that want to promote fast change tend to emphasize short-term rewards.

Equity vs. Cash Stock and options usually represent a larger share of compensation than cash does. The business’s maturity and geography often affect the mix.

Group vs. Individual Organizational culture and values will have an impact on how much pay a company ties to achieving group goals and individual ones.
