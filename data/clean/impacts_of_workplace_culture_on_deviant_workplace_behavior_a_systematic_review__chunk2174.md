## Conclusions and Implications for Further Research

According to the findings of our literature review drawn from the following four databases: Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and SAGE Journals, from the time period beginning in 2012 and continuing through 2022, it was found that deviant workplace behavior is signifi- cantly influenced by workplace culture. According to the findings of the empirical research, it is necessary to gen- erate conceptual clarity within a good theoretical frame- work for the study of organizational culture as an environmental or the research reported in the evaluation was conducted with a diverse range of respondents, which may result in conclu- sions that understate or exaggerate the population effect. Hershcovis (2007) argue that the predictors of deviant workplace behavior depend on the participant; therefore, it is necessary to specifically indicate the participant to whom the study was intended, such as a supervisor, senior officer, or general clerk.
