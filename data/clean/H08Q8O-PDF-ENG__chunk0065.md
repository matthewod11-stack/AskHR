not. Many assistants had longer commutes and more-complicated

childcare situations than the senior partners. Aware of the importance

of the assistants’ work and acknowledging the necessity for his ﬁrm to

retain them, the CEO decided to adapt the policy to their needs and

allow them to work from home several days a week. In consequence, he

told the senior partners that they would have to adapt and get used to

not having their personal assistants on-site all the time.

Our view is not that policies should never be set or that existing ones

be abolished but that they should be treated as values rather than rules.

Novo Nordisk doesn’t have an enforced rule about hybrid work but

rather it has a formal opinion, which is that people should work in the

oﬃce a little more than at home. So on average you should be working

in the oﬃce more than 2.5 days a week. But one manager we spoke

to explained, “We believe in ﬂexibility,” meaning that employees have

a variety of hybrid work arrangements and exceptions can be granted for diﬀerent reasons. Attentive adaptability suggests that to rebuild

the psychological contract, managers need to move away from a rigid

standard and instead think of a template with guidelines that can be

discussed with employees.
