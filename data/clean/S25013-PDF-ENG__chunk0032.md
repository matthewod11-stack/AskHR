## No matter how much money your business invests in artiﬁcial

intelligence, your leadership team must consider the psychological

barriers to its adoption. And with each of the ﬁve barriers I’ve described,

you must realize that interventions meant to increase acceptance can

inadvertently increase resistance to AI.

Rather than leaping straight into solution mode, tread carefully. Every

AI system, use case, pilot, and full-scale deployment will encounter

diﬀerent barriers. It’s your job as a leader to recognize them and help

your customers and employees overcome them.
