# really bad sacriﬁces.

Adi, guys like you and me, our age, in our ﬁfties, you notice that we

don’t make those sacriﬁces anymore. And the reason is because our

time parameters are shorter. But also we’ve had bitter experience with

these types of things. It’s funny, it’s like I’m a grandfather now and my

grandson was born and suddenly I was a lot less interested in working.

But part of it was the bitter experience.

I’ll tell you a story actually that will motivate this. When I was

interviewing this woman for my last book, which is called From Strength

to Strength, about how to get happier as you get older, a titan of Wall

Street. This woman was just famous and rich, a billionaire, and she was

horribly unhappy. She was my age, late ﬁfties.

And I said, “What’s wrong?”

She said, “Well, my husband and I were roommates. I’m kind of cordial

with my adult kids, but it’s not close. I’m getting bad reports from the

doctor. I think I drink too much. I need to go to the gym. My employees

are starting to doubt the wisdom of my decision-making. And I don’t

know, what do I do?”

And I said, “What do you mean? You don’t need a Harvard professor to

tell you what to do. You’re prescribing to yourself, stepping back, going

away with your husband. You’re already rich. Why don’t you do that?”
