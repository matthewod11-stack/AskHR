# Behavioral Scales

The behaviorally-based instrumeid most frequently recommended by industrial psychologists is the behaviorally anchored rating scale (BARS). This scale was origi- nally referred to in the literature as the behavior,A expectation scale (BES), and the two terms are used interchangeably.12

The construction of BARS generally follows procedures developed by Smith and Kendall)", The first step is to collect critical inLidents that descnbe a wide range of behavior and place them in broad categories (e.g., planning, testing and evaluation, instruction, etc.). Each category serves as one performance dimension for appraising an individual. A group of people with knowledge of the job are given the set of critical incidents and categories. Members of the group are asked to match each incident to the category they believe the incident illustrates. This procedure i.) known as retranslation. Incidents that are not a, igned to the same category by a high percentage of the group and those that fall frequently into two or more categories are discarded. Another group of people also familiar with the job are given the final categorized list of incidents and are asked to rate each incident on a five to nine point scale, representing a continuum of job performance from outstanding io poor. The only items retained are those on which there is much agreement. These incidents are used as anchors on the rating scale, hence the term behaviorally anchored. The value git..n to each incident is the mean value assigned by the group. An example of BARS for the position of instructor is shown in Figure 3.9.

5 00-- -Professor can be expected to vary syllabus of class to fit students' background. Emphasis would be placed on projects and discussion rather than lectu.d. Grading is based on quality of projects and tests

4 00-- -Professor can be expectad to meet all classes, to add the lecture with current materials, to answer course material throughly, and present a variety of test methods

3 00-- -Professor can be expected to meet all classes, then deliver organized 1:3

with appropriate standardized testing devices.

2 00-- -Professor can be expected to meet almost all classes and to closely repeat

text, paying little attention to outside material or student questions

1 00-- Professoi can be expected to hold ::.lasses irregularly. Also can be expected to present "true life" examples frequently which have little relationship to course material.
