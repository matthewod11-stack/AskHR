impact of job resources and previous levels of engagement. Thus, the more employees believe they are able to meet their job demands and that they will experience good outcomes, the higher their levels of work engagement. Van den Heuvel et al. (2009) investigated a heterogeneous sample of employees in a variety of both public and private organizations. They found positive associations between self-efficacy, optimism, and meaning-making on the one hand, and work engagement on the other hand, suggesting that the ability to make meaning of challenging and ambiguous situations also has the potential to foster vigour, dedication, and absorption.

Evidence shows that employees can develop their personal resources through training and development. For example, Luthans et al. (2010) assigned participants randomly to treatment (n¼153) or control (n¼89) groups. The treatment groups received a two-hour training intervention conducted by trained facilitators who utilized a series of exercises and group discussions designed to impact the participants’ level of efficacy, hope, optimism and resilience (collectively referred to as psychological capital or PsyCap). In the training intervention, the facilitators used a series of writing, discussion and reflective exercises specific to each of the four personal resources. For instance, one of the exercises focused on broadening the hope-oriented self-regulating capacity of trainees and developing strategies towards the achievement of a specific goal. First, each participant was asked to reflect on and then write down their personal goals. The facilitator then led participants through a series of techniques to set and phrase these goals to increase their agentic capacity (Bandura, 2008). This included parceling large goals into manageable units, thereby also increasing efficacy over smaller sub-goals. Next, participants were asked to consider multiple pathways to accomplishing each goal and to share those pathways in small discussion groups. The participants therefore acted as models for each other. The capacity for pathway generation was thus expected to be increased through vicarious learning and, in turn, to enhance participants’ efficacy in utilizing the hope application of deriving multiple pathways to accomplish a given goal. In addition, by increasing their efficacy to accomplish the goal, the participants were expected to increase their positive expectations of goal accomplishment - thatis,theiroptimism. Luthans and hiscolleagues found that the intervention had a positive impact on participants’ on-the-job performance.

In another intervention study, this time spanning several days, Demerouti et al. (2011) tested the effects of “personal effectiveness” training aimed at helping employees cope with their changing work environments. Several personal resources were monitored before and after the training, including assertiveness, self-efficacy, resilience, optimism, and hope. The goal of the training was to modify cognitions, behaviour, and emotions, using principles derived from rational emotive therapy, tension control, vicarious learning, and goal setting. The results showed that self-ratings and other- ratings of personal resources increased significantly as a result of the training. These findings clearly suggest that engagement can be improved by optimizing personal resources.

Encouraging employees to engage in job crafting and voice We have noted that HRM professionals can help facilitate work engagement by providing an optimal work environment, as well as by offering the right training to employees. However, employees themselves may also actively change or “craft” the design of their jobs by choosing tasks, negotiating different job content, and by assigning meaning to their tasks or jobs (Parker and Ohly, 2008). Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001) defined job crafting as the physical and cognitive changes individuals
