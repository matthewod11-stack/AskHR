## Limitations and Directions for Future Research

Despite its contribution, the present study has a number of limitations, which may suggest possible future directions for the research. First of all, the current study is mainly based on cross-sectional data. The results of the study may thus not provide strong evidence of causal directions. However, it is reasonable to argue that employees’ perceptions of fairness are the causes of organizational commitment, rather than its consequences. An extensive longitudinal rather than a cross-sectional study that explores causal relationships among variables is thus needed to support on the empirical findings of the present study. A low reliability (alpha .60) of the internal pay comparison construct is another methodological limitation. In addition, supervisory performance appraisal is not an objective measurement since it might be in itself a subject to discrimination and unfair treatment.

Secondly, since the study was conducted in the academic context of Finland, it might be suggested that the findings cannot be sufficiently generalized to all societies and to all organizational fields. As Leung (2005) noted, there is a tendency for most social scientists, including organizational justice researchers, to ignore social contexts by the desire for universal knowledge. However, the concept of organizational justice, the employees’ attitudes towards various organizational practices including pay may vary considerably across locations due to, for example, differences in gender roles, economic development, compensation differentiation, and gender segregation of a certain market. Also the results concerning the impact of internal and external comparisons on organizational commitment might differ by context (whether the level of compensation is at the market, lower or higher than the market). Knowledge concerning the pay system might also have a negative impact, depending on how the procedures are
