## important for understanding organizations.

Organization theorists have argued that a narrative or story is a common way

of encoding information about what to do in an organization (see, for example,

Martin 1982; Heath and Seidel 2004). If the punch line of the story is success or

failure, a story is basically an instruction about how to behave. Narratives may be

a superior encoding form from the point of view of human memory—if they are

better remembered, they will not degrade as much as other kinds of information

when passed down from old workers to new ones. If it is fun to tell stories——they

often involve humor—they may spread more rapidly and reliably through a firm than boring instructions. !
