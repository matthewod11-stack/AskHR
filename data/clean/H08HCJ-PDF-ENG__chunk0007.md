So what should startups do? Does the beneﬁt of being close to talent

outweigh the ﬁnancial burden of attracting it away from big ﬁrms?

And what part do large ﬁrms play in this? In new research, we

analyzed more than 180 million job ads placed between 2010 and 2020,

including ads from more than 140,000 U.S. startups founded in that

impact on startups’ ability to grow. We examine our ﬁndings and oﬀer

recommendations for startups looking to navigate this complicated

landscape in order to take advantage of resource-rich locations without

being crowded out.
