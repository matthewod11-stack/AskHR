# other areas?

- Does it provide something (visibility, skill building, growth): Will this

allow me to showcase my skills to managers or does it allow me to reﬁne/

develop a skill?

If the opportunities or tasks aren’t related to what you want to

master, use the above skill of “decision delay buﬀer” to decline. If

the opportunities or tasks are related to what you want to master, use

the above skills of “preemptive communication” to alert your manager

about your interest and to help you re-prioritize if possible.

We often feel the pressure to say “yes” to every opportunity, believing

that missing out on anything could set us back. When you are feeling

overwhelmed, it is helpful to remind yourself that by letting an

opportunity go and not overcommitting yourself, you’re not failing,

you’re being thoughtful about your choices. This allows you to protect

your valuable time and energy resources to reserve them for things that

truly matter — your emotional wellbeing and professional growth.

The truth is: not every opportunity is meant for you, and sometimes

missed chances can make space for the right chances.
