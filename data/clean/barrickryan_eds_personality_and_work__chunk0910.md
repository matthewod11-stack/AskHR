# 328 PERSONALITY AND WORK

they can best be organized and structured. The purpose in invit- ing these authors to contribute to this volume was to provide the I/O community of researchers with a summary of research on the structure of personality from the perspective of two leading schol- ars from the broader ﬁeld of personality psychology. They point out that Allport (1937) reviewed deﬁnitions of the concept of per- sonality and catalogued over ﬁfty distinct meanings for the term. This is not a trivial issue; deﬁnitions force researchers to make ex- plicit their assumptions, and they also inﬂuence which criterion variables will be selected. After reﬂecting on these comments, we were struck by how seldom researchers studying the role of per- sonality in the workplace explicitly deﬁne personality (we count ourselves among the guilty!). The de facto approach seems to be that personality is deﬁned as whatever constructs are measured by the inventory the researcher has chosen to use.

An important contribution of Saucier and Goldberg is that while the Big Five factor solution is robust, other factor structures emerge that may also be useful. For example, one-, two-, three-, seven-, and nine-factor solutions have also been derived. Support for the Big Five model is strong in terms of social importance, breadth, stability, cross-observer agreement, and generality across peer and self-rating data. But the Big Five compares less favorably to alternative models on criteria such as causal clarity, correspon- dence to main lines of biological inﬂuence, predictive validity, gen- eralizability across cultures and languages, association with theory, and comprehensiveness.

Saucier and Goldberg also discuss a vexing problem for our ﬁeld: the relative advantages of subdividing the broader factors into more speciﬁc subcomponents (facets). The problem with this approach is the difﬁculty in achieving consensus about how many facets there are and what they measure. An advantage of measur- ing subcomponents pertains to the potential gain in predictive va- lidity, which comes from tapping into many speciﬁc sources of variance. In general, however, it appears that the more speciﬁc the level of constructs is, the more potential confusion is engendered for researchers.

The challenge for I/O psychologists becomes one of deter- mining which structural model of personality is best for predicting work outcomes. A question we need to address is whether we have
