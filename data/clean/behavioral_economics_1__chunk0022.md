Equilibrium: Moving beyond the level of individual choice and judgment, behavioral economics has

also contributed to a shift in the study of equilibrium at the market or game-theoretic level. Game theorists, in

particular, have never been comfortable with simply assuming that beliefs and choices are in equilibrium—i.e.,

that players correctly anticipate what others will do—without clearly specifying mechanisms that generate

equilibration. Evolutionary game theory (e.g., Weibull, 1995; Samuelson, 1997), and the sensible extension to

the study of imitation (e.g., Schlag, 1998), are important approaches which show how equilibria might emerge

from limited rationality and selection pressures.

Empirical models of learning in games have also been carefully calibrated on many different types of

experimental data. One approach is reinforcement of chosen strategies (Arthur, 1991; Erev and Roth, 1998). A

seemingly different approach is updating of beliefs based on experience, as in fictitious play (e.g., Fudenberg

and Levine, 1998). However, Camerer and Ho (1999) noted that fictitious play is simply a generalized kind of

reinforcement in which unchosen strategies are reinforced as strongly as chosen strategies are. That recognition

inspired a hybrid “dual process theory” (EWA) in which reinforcement of actual and foregone outcomes can

differ, nesting choice reinforcement and fictitious play as boundary cases. The hybrid model tends to fit about

as well as each of the boundary cases, and sometimes fits substantially better when one of the models misses a

central feature of the data. Ho, Camerer and Chong (2005) introduce a “self-tuning” version of their hybrid

theory in which the key parameters adjust flexibly to experience, which economizes on parameters allows
