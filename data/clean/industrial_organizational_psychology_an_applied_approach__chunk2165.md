Though job satisfaction and organizational commitment are different work- related attitudes, they will be discussed together in this chapter because they are highly correlated and result in similar employee behaviors. As shown in Table ., meta- analyses indicate that satisfied employees tend to be committed to an organiza- tion (Cooper-Hakim & Viswesvaran, ), and employees who are satisfied and committed are more likely to attend work (Hackett, ), stay with an organiza- tion (Tett & Meyer, ), arrive at work on time (Koslowsky, Sagie, Krausz, & Singer, ), perform well (Judge, Thoresen, Bono, & Patton, ), and engage in behaviors helpful to the organization (LePine, Erez, & Johnson, ) than are employees who are not satisfied or committed.

The relationship between job satisfaction and performance is not consistent across people or jobs.
