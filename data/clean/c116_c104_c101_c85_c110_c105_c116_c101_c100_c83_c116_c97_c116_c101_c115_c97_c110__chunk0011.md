# 250 LAW & POLICY July 1999

disputes and lawsuits when it fires employees. PCO corporate data show that there is much less post-termination disputing, including lawsuits, in Canada. As Table 1 shows, of employees who were terminated in Canada in the 1995 fiscal year, 71 percent raised no dispute with PCO after the termination. In the United States, only 39 percent of those terminated left without disputing the firing. On the other end of the spectrum, there are terminated employees who contest their termination by filing a lawsuit. Of terminated employees, 7 percent of Canadians eventually filed a lawsuit, while 23 percent in the United States filed a lawsuit.4 In the middle of the dispute spectrum, there are those employees who contest their termi- nation in some way without a lawsuit. This ``mid-level'' disputing ranges from simply writing a letter contesting a severance package or contesting the termination itself to hiring an attorney to do the same. In Canada, 22 percent of those who were fired engaged in some level of posttermination disputing that fell short of actually filing a lawsuit. In the United States, on the other hand, 38 percent of those terminated engaged in some sort of posttermination disputing that did not culminate in a lawsuit (personal interviews).

In the years studied, not a single terminated employee won a lawsuit against PCO in either country. Even more striking, PCO has not lost a post-termination lawsuit in either country Â± ever. Despite this point of similarity, the cross-national differences in disputing rates are worth noting, not just because they are so great but also because they are inversely related to the strength with which the two countries protect employees' right to continuity of employment.

PCO U.S. and PCO Canada termination procedures varied in notice- able ways, at both the structural level in the organization of the human resources department and at the procedural level in terms of the day-to-day decision making regarding termination. We found that PCO has more deeply entrenched bureaucratic structures within PCO U.S. to process legal claims. These differences between PCO U.S. and PCO Canada are due to a number of factors. First, PCO U.S. employees have access to a greater variety of legal claims. Thus, PCO U.S. officials face greater legal un- certainty than their Canadian counterparts regarding the source of a termination claim. Moreover, the employee in the United States who makes a wrongful termination claim has more potent legal remedies available to her.

Although it is difficult to estimate precisely how much PCO spends on the termination process in each country, it seems clear that U.S. prelitigation and litigation processes are generally more expensive for PCO. Not only does PCO U.S. spend more money on the termination process, but the money spent is channeled largely to legal and quasi-legal professionals while the expenditures made by PCO Canada go toward providing severance packages and services to the terminated Canadian employee. PCO Canada pays workers while PCO U.S. pays lawyers.
