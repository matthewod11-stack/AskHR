## of neurodiversity in the media, the myth of the “perfect” family, the

pressure to be the “perfect” parent or to have the “perfect” child,

the social media illusion. But it all comes down to it often being too

exhausting to get into explanations at work on top of everything else we

are dealing with. Some of us summarize these experiences with words

like “autism” or “developmentally delayed,” but if someone hasn’t dealt

with these issues, they really have no idea what those words mean.

These personal challenges also mean that parents of neurodivergent

kids bring new abilities to their work beyond job-related skills, forged in

the crucible of an atypical parenting situation. In terms of planning and

time management, we are experts at forecasting successful timelines,

and are hypervigilant against obstacles to a team’s goals.

If we are to use these skills and thrive in the workplace, colleagues

need to more deeply understand our parenting situation. In personal

contexts, a lack of understanding can be annoying: friends who get

angry when we miss an appointment to deal with a meltdown at

home, diﬃculty ﬁnding babysitters, everyone’s unsolicited advice on

something we never said was a problem. In work contexts, however,

parenting a neurodivergent child can be debilitating. We need more

support. We need more ﬂexibility. We do not need yet another ﬁght.

Organizations need to provide systems and processes to help employees
