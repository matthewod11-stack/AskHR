## REASSESSING THE HISTORY OFAMBIVALENCE TOWARD THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL LIVES

It is difﬁcult to understand the history of ambivalence toward the study of individual lives in personality psychology if we accept historical accounts that attribute the origins of the ﬁeld to clinically-derived theories, on the one hand (e.g., C. S. Hall & Lindzey, 1957), or to the publication of Allport’s and Murray’s texts, on the other hand (e.g., Sanford, 1985). Each of these historical reconstructions emphasizes the “dissident” role of personality theorists, overlooking broader contextual inﬂuences on the direction of personality research, as well as the development of the psychometric tradition before 1930. Adoptingalongertimeperspective,wehaveseenthatthepsy- chometric approach was predominant in personality research by the time the ﬁeld was institutionalized in the mid-1930s and that the decline of interest in studies of individual lives between the 1930s and the 1950s continued a general trend in psychology (dubbed “the triumph of the aggregate”; Danziger, 1990, p. 68) that began as early as the 1910s.

Adopting a multidisciplinary perspective, we have sug- gested that the marginal status of case studies and life histories in personality psychology was related to their iden- tiﬁcation as preferred methods in psychiatry and in abnormal psychology (at a time when this ﬁeld was primarily a med- ical specialty), and in sociology, where they were associated with the emergence of empirical research. In contrast, psychologists interested in personality adopted psychomet- ric measures as efﬁcient means of meeting practical goals. Psychologists working in “applied” areas were particularly attracted to quantitative methods that could establish their scientiﬁc expertise and differentiate them from their “pseudo- scientiﬁc” competitors. These preferences persisted during the emergence of personality psychology as a separate sub- discipline in the 1930s, despite calls for more attention to case study methods.
