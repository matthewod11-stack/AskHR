# 192 Personality

Gordon Allport’s and Henry Murray’s efforts to promote studies of individual lives were initially less successful than their efforts to systematize the new subﬁeld. While generally agreeing that the goal of personality psychology was to un- derstand the individual person, other authors of personality texts during this period, like Woodworth (1929) before them, used case studies for illustrative purposes (see McAdams & West, 1997) but continued to describe them as clinical methods rather than as research methods. Although several students and colleagues of Allport and Murray explored methods of studying individual lives, attention to these meth- ods during the 1930s and 1940s reﬂected primarily the inter- ests of sociologists (particularly those involved with the SSRC) and European psychologists rather than a more gen- eral acceptance of these methods by American personality psychologists.

Without these external supports, methods of studying in- dividual lives received even less attention from personality psychologists during the post–World War II period, which saw an increase in the use of survey and quantitative tech- niques in the social sciences (Platt, 1992, 1996). Although Allport’s monograph on personal documents (G. W. Allport, 1942) fueled controversy regarding clinical versus statistical prediction during the 1940s and 1950s, it appears to have had more of an impact on clinical psychologists than on personal- ity researchers (e.g., O’Connell, 1958). The post–World War II expansion of clinical psychology contributed to the continuation of the prediction debate, but, ironically, drew at- tention away from Allport’s goal of developing idiographic research methods in personality psychology. As Allport ob- served later, “We stop with our wobbly laws of personality and seldom confront them with the concrete person” (G. W. Allport, 1962a, p. 407).
