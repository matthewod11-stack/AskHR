# How We Learn

Another of our collective theories is that feedback contains useful

information, and that this information is the magic ingredient that

will accelerate someone’s learning. Again, the research points in the

opposite direction. Learning is less a function of adding something

that isn’t there than it is of recognizing, reinforcing, and reﬁning what

already is. There are two reasons for this.

The ﬁrst is that, neurologically, we grow more in our areas of greater

ability (our strengths are our development areas). The brain continues

to develop throughout life, but each person’s does so diﬀerently.
