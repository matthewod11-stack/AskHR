## resources—in particular, for extensive training and building the right

culture in the workforce. At Pal’s, workers are trained for weeks on each

process and must pass a certiﬁcation test before they can make products

for customers. They must be recertiﬁed periodically to ensure that their

skills are up to par. All Pal’s stores are managed by “owner-operators”

(who are not actually owners but whose compensation is tied 100%

to their individual store’s proﬁts). Pal’s believes that these managers

are critical to nurturing the culture of quality and to training and

developing talent. All manager candidates are put through an extensive

screening process, and selected candidates, regardless of their prior

industry experience, attend the company’s leadership-development

program. It normally takes candidates three years to be allowed to

run their own store. The company’s growth strategy is dictated by the

availability of store managers: When Pal’s has a candidate ready, it will

open a new store.
