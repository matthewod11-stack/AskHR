### **[Leading beings that don\'t sleep, eat, or have emotions]{.underline}**

[Managing AI agents requires a fundamental shift in leadership thinking.
These team members never get tired, never have bad days, and never need
motivation. But they also never have intuitive leaps, never understand
context they weren\'t explicitly given, and never care about the mission
beyond their programmed objectives.]{.underline}

[Research by Stanford on hybrid team management identified key
leadership adaptations needed (Stanford HAI, 2024):]{.underline}

- [Clear specifications replace motivational speeches.]{.underline}

- [Version control replaces performance improvement
 > plans.]{.underline}

- [API documentation replaces onboarding materials.]{.underline}

[But here\'s what\'s fascinating: managing AI agents well makes you
better at managing humans too. The clarity required to direct AI ---
explicit goals, measurable outcomes, unambiguous communication ---
benefits human team members as well. Many managers discover that their
\"AI management\" practices improve their overall leadership
effectiveness.]{.underline}
