# Stop Striving to Be Your “Future Self”

models of the future self. Our future selves are not aspirations, butmetaphysical judgements that we impose — either uncritically orunintentionally — to make sense of our own existence. That is tosay, our goals, roles, and aspirations are not simply “good” or“valuable” on their own. We must recognize that it is we,ourselves, who ascribe value and justification to them, and notthe other way around.Of course, changing our outlooks in this way is not easy. As Sartrenotes, our tendency to seek a unification between our sense of selfand our “purpose” is a natural instinct. We long for some Platonicessence, for the universe itself to bestow deep meaning untoourselves and our actions, but find none because humanity isungrounded and “condemned to be free.” In other words, anymeaning we choose to see is exactly that — a choice, and our ownfree choice at that.At every given moment, we must choose how it is that we willrelate to the world around us and what we choose to do with ourlives.At the same time, that is not to say that there is no place formaintaining a concept of future self at all.

Research on creativeself-expectations suggests that in creative settings, or those inwhich we give ourselves the freedom to explore and self-define,future self expectations may lead to a self-fulfilling prophecyeffect, which can allow us to be more productive in achieving ourgoals.I believe that the answer, then, is to allow ourselves to recognizethat our future selves are indeterminate. We must creatively(rather than methodically) work towards their actualization. If wecan do that, we can dream without consequence.
