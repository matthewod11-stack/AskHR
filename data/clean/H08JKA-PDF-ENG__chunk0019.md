# practice-based learning.

Standard Chartered used “brain training games” to get employees to

practice new behaviors and integrate what they learned into their daily

work. These are two-minute tasks designed to build habit and reduce

reaction time. They can be used to enhance product knowledge, explain

acronyms, or build functional skills. For example, a brain training game

on data analysis rapidly shows random examples of clean and “dirty”

data sets, prompting the user to spot errors or make choices that help

them more quickly evaluate the quality of the data they work with.

According to Villeneuve, “We’ve delivered over 86 internally built brain

training games and we’ve been able to prove that many of these new

methods improve productivity, product knowledge and speed to desk

radically.”
