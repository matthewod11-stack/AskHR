## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Reimagine Scale

What are these human diseconomies? As an example, scaling farming has proven eﬃcient, but an increasing number of voices — including

those in big agriculture — are warning that it is devastating our long-

term health and the future of the planet. Today you need to eat between

eight and 21 oranges to get the nutrients your grandparents received in

a single orange because soil has been stripped by fertilizer, pesticide,

and monocrops of the microbiological community that creates ﬂavor

and nutrition. Anyone who has tasted mass-produced strawberries

and tomatoes knows ﬁrsthand that they often taste like bags of water

compared to their more delicate, ﬂavorful cousins raised in good soil. In the pursuit of scale, we have created eﬃcient food that can be shipped

long distances but is not delicious. How can we bring these measures

into the conversation — not just in food, but across all of business?
