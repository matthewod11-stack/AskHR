# amygdala, doesn’t.

If you tell me I’ve acted ineffectively, it may trigger an alarm in my

amygdala: “Danger! I might get kicked out of my tribe!” The stress

hormones cortisol and adrenaline flood my bloodstream, throwing my

body into “fight or flight” mode. The fight reaction leads me to respond

defensively: “I’m not the problem. You are!” The flight reaction may result

in a comment like “Thanks so much for that feedback. That is very helpful,”

after which I try to never speak to you again.

The challenge with feedback, therefore, is to make sure that your delivery

succeeds in helping the cortex override the amygdala.
