# ENDNOTES

- 1. We acknowledge the helpful comments on and suggested revisions of an earlier version of this paper made by reviewers and editors of Human Resource Management.

- 3. Another way to think of grievance filing is as griev- ance “initiation” which is influenced by various grievable “events”. See, for example, Bemmels & Foley (1996).

- 2. For other recent reviews and assessments of re- search on unionized grievance procedures, see Lewin (1999), Bemmels & Foley (1996), Labig & Greer (1988), Gordon & Miller (1984), and Lewin & Peterson (1988, Chp. 2). For reviews and assessments of research on non-union griev- ance procedures, see Lewin (2000, 1997) and Peterson & Lewin (1992). Also, Peterson (1992) reviews both the unionized and non-union griev- ance literature.

- 4. These “non-significant” findings are nevertheless important because they imply that management decisions to adopt new technology or to decen- tralize organizational decision-making will not lead to increased grievance activity.

- 5. Lewin & Peterson (1999) found that grievants and especially their supervisors were significantly more likely to be terminated following grievance settlement than were employees and supervisors who not involved in grievance activity.
