Note: The panel data estimation result based on Rand om effect and p value is less than equal to 0.05 wh ich is indicated by the ** (stars) in the above table.

The empirical result (in Table 4) achieved from random estimate show that regression model with dependent variable LFDI fits well with independents determinant variables as value of adjusted R-Squared is significant between(0.70). Highest value of R squared also

indicates that the explanatory variable included in the equation can explain most of the variation in the dependent variable between the nation. The coefficient of the Gross domestic product at per capita and Export and imports of goods and services are statistically
