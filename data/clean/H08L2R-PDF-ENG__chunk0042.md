# Don’ts

- Go it alone: When people work predominantly alone with

generative AI, rather than actively involving and engaging with

human teammates, it can reduce interpersonal communication and

knowledge sharing within the team. This can hinder team-based

judgment and the ability to prevent and mitigate risks. Take breaks

from solo AI interactions to engage face-to-face with teammates,

involve other colleagues in the AI-aided process, seek feedback from

experts, integrate diverse viewpoints, and encourage peer learning.

- Go too fast: You may tend to type, click, or advance too hastily. The

speed at which gen AI executes can lead humans to rush through

without reﬂection. Request AI to help you pause and reﬂect: Explicitly

prompt AI to ask for your feedback, ensuring you have time to reﬂect

and validate before moving forward.
