# Design Thinking Competency Model

As a result of this review of the literature, we have created a design thinking competency model (Figure 2), adapted from Shute and Torres (2012). This model displays a hierarchically arrayed set of variables (or nodes), from general to more specific when viewing from left to right. This competency model represents an

operationalization of the design thinking construct and may also help drive the crea- tion of appropriate activities that would allow for the collection of relevant evidence to inform variables in the model. For example, consider the variable “Iterate Diagrams” in Figure 2. Skills associated with this variable include tinkering, creat- ing, and testing ideas via diagrams. Testing, in turn, entails initial testing of the design idea, getting feedback, modifying the design, reevaluating it, and making a decision to accept or reject the modeled idea. To assess students’ competency levels relative to the iterate diagrams variable, we would have to put them in a situation in which those constituent skills could be employed, such as in a game or simulation. Diagnostically, the model could provide the framework for evaluating the degree to which students are demonstrating particular design thinking skills at various times and at various grain sizes relative to the model (for more, see Shute & Torres, 2012).
