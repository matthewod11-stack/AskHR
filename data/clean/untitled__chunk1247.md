# Characteristics of the Early Theories

Theories of development may be characterized, most cen- trally, by whether they posit that development is the conse- quence of internal (nature) or external (nurture) forces. Overton and Reese (1973) describe this dichotomy as organ- ismic versus mechanistic. The organismic view is character- ized by a focus on biological or endogenous accounts of development. It has as its basic metaphor “the organism, the living, organized system presented to experience in mul- tiple forms. . . . In this representation, the whole is organic rather than mechanical in nature” (Reese & Overton, 1970, pp. 132–133). The mechanistic view is characterized by a focus on environmental mechanisms, and development is seen as essentially an externally controlled or driven process. The machine is often used as the metaphor for this develop- mental model of development. In the early era, Baldwin, Freud, Hall, and Binet all endorsed an organismic approach. As Cairns noted of Baldwin: “His aim was to outline ‘a sys- tem of genetic psychology’ that would attempt to achieve a synthesis of the current biological theory of organic adapta- tion with the doctrine of the infant’s development” (Baldwin, 1895, p. vii, cited by Cairns, 1983, p. 54).

Another way in which theories of development can be described is in terms of their breadth. The scope of the early theories was notably broad. Not only did they include emo- tionsandcognitions,sexandsensation,butacenturyago,the- orists in the grand tradition assumed that large portions of the developmental landscape could be accounted for in terms of a limited number of general, universal principles. They were not unaware of cross-cultural variation, but they viewed other cultures as living laboratories that could provide oppor- tunities to evaluate the operation of fundamental laws of de- velopment. Freud’s use of anthropological data in Totem & Taboo (Freud, 1918) was an attempt to describe unconscious motivation in other cultures. This was a prime example of our ancestors’ eagerness to seek conﬁrmation of their theories in other cultures. Their understanding of those cultures, how- ever, was quite limited.
