# Penalties/Sanctions

Contractors and subcontractors who breach the required contract terms or violate the Act may be subject to a variety of penalties. The underpayment of wages and overtime pay may result in the cancellation of the

contract and/or withholding of contract payments in amounts suﬃcient to reimburse the underpayment.

Liquidated damages and/or penalties may be assessed on a daily basis for each underage minor or

incarcerated individual who is employed, for which contract payments may also be withheld. The Department

of Labor may also bring legal action to collect wage underpayment and ﬁnes for underpaying workers and/or illegally employing underage minors or incarcerated individuals. Willful violations may subject the employer to

cancellation of the current contract and debarment from future federal contracts for a three-year period.

Upon issuance and service of a formal complaint on the contractor, a hearing shall be scheduled before an

Administrative Law Judge. The decision of the Administrative Law Judge may be appealed to the

Administrative Review Board (ARB). ARB determinations on violations and debarment may be appealed to and are enforceable through the federal courts.
