### **Stage 5: Scaling successful patterns**

The temptation is to immediately scale successful human-AI collaboration
across the entire organization. Resist this urge. Different teams,
different types of work, and different risk profiles require different
collaboration models.

Instead, identify patterns from your pilot that can be adapted rather
than replicated. If your pilot team succeeded through iterative
refinement with AI, that practice might transfer even if the specific
workflow doesn\'t. If clear role definition proved crucial, focus on
that element when expanding to new teams.

A manufacturing company learned this lesson when their successful AI
collaboration in quality control didn\'t translate directly to supply
chain management. But the principle of using AI for anomaly detection
while relying on humans for causal analysis proved valuable across both
domains.
