Think about the last argument you had. As you walked away, what

popped into your head? The perfect comeback, right? But why didn’t it

come to you in the heat of the moment? Because during the argument,

your brain was in overdrive, defending itself. At work, our brains are

similarly overloaded with emails, meetings, reports, training, and so

on. We often don’t have time to think. This is because our brains are

stuck in what science calls the beta state — a state of constant busyness

where creativity is blocked. When you’re in beta, the door between your

conscious and subconscious mind is shut.
