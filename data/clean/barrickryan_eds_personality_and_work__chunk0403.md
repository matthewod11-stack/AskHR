# Conclusion

This chapter has reviewed and advanced research in two areas rel- evant to understanding the link between personality and individ- ual job performance. The ﬁrst area is identifying relationships between speciﬁc personality predictors and speciﬁc job perfor- mance criteria. According to Hough (2001; Hough & Ones, 2001), an important goal for personality researchers is the development of a nomological net of personality-performance relationships for use in building predictor equations for speciﬁc situations. The tax- onomy of performance dimensions proposed in this chapter is a step in this direction. This taxonomy includes task performance, citizenship performance, and adaptive performance at the high- est level, with a second and third level of more speciﬁc dimensions. To advance our state of knowledge most efﬁciently, primary stud- ies must be conducted relating speciﬁc personality variables to these performance dimensions, and meta-analyses must summa- rize this research at more speciﬁc levels than the Big Five and over- all task and citizenship performance. This performance taxonomy should also be reﬁned by identifying other important performance dimensions that are not adequately represented in the taxonomy. The second area of research is investigating the mediating vari- ables through which personality inﬂuences job performance. The
