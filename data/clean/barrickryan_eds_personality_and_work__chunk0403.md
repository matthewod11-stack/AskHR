# 112 PERSONALITY AND WORK

predictive to a lesser extent because of their weaker associations with these constructs. Personality variables are probably most pre- dictive of adaptive performance because of the importance of self- regulatory skills when quickly adjusting to a new situation. Ability variables should also be strongly related because of the importance of skills such as problem solving.

An immediate need for research with this model is the medi- ating effect of citizenship knowledge and skill. So far, support for this effect has been mixed at best. In addition, we have very little idea at this time how the aspect of performance being studied in- ﬂuences the predictors of motivation. For example, certain per- sonality variables are likely to be highly related to motives, expectancies, self-efﬁcacy, goal content, and goal commitment when the criterion is a dimension of citizenship performance, but they have no relationship to these constructs when the criterion is a dimension of task performance.
