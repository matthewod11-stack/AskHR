# Time orientation

- Adaptability. Good forms allow managers in different functions and departments to adapt them to their particular needs and situations. This feature encourages widespread use of the form.

- Comprehensiveness. Good forms include all the major areas of performance for a particular position for the entire review period.

- Definitional clarity. Desirable competencies and results are clearly defined for all raters so that everyone evaluates the same attributes. This feature enhances consistency of ratings across raters and levels of the organization.

- Communication. The meaning of each of the components of the form must be successfully communicated to all people participating in the evaluation process. This enhances acceptance of the system and motivation to participate in it both as raters and as ratees.

- Time orientation. Good forms help clarify expectations about performance. They address not only the past but also the future.3

Table 6.2 includes a summary of the features that are desirable in all forms regardless of specific content and format. Letâ€™s consider the two illustrative forms discussed earlier to see how they fare in relation to these desirable features. First, consider the form shown in Figure 6.1. It is simple because it is easy to understand and clear. The fact that it includes an essay format implies that it would take a little more time to complete, but the number of essays is kept to a minimum. The form is also relevant, but only if the supervisor enters the correct job description and actual accountabilities. This form can be extremely descriptive owing to its narrative nature. The form encourages the manager to give examples of relevant behavior. Next, the form is also adaptable, perhaps too adaptable; it would be hard to compare performance across employees because the manager can adapt the form to each employee. This form is comprehensive, but again only if the manager lists all of the expected accountabilities. This form does not have definitional clarity. Because the competencies listed are not clearly defined, ratings are likely to be inconsistent across raters. Next, this form can be communicated across the organization. Manager acceptance may be hard to gain, however, because of the amount of detail required by the essay answers. Finally, the form is time oriented. It asks for past and future performance expectations and goals. In short, the following table summarizes which of the desirable characteristics are present in this form:
