# each level

Level 1 - Operational Reporting: As a groundwork level for data analysis,

organizations with this maturity level use data and metrics primarily to understand past

events and possibly the reasons behind them. The focus is on comprehending the

available data and gaining consensus on its interpretation.

Level 2 - Advanced Reporting: advanced reporting means to be more <proactive or

routine= by employing automated reporting systems and data visualization dashboards.

Relationships among variables are also explored and analyzed.

Level 3 - Strategic Analytics: Organizations at this level move beyond understanding

past events and relationships to developing causal models, root cause identification, and

determining the impact on business outcomes. An example of this analysis is

identifying the drivers of turnover or employee engagement.

Level 4 - Predictive Analytics: The highest level involves forecasting future events,

trends, or outcomes and using those predictions for business planning. An instance from

Murray et al. (2018) is to utilize data on turnover, promotions, and market trends to

create scenarios that inform workforce planning.
