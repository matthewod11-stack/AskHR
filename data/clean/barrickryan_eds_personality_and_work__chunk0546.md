# Personality and Job Satisfaction

One of the most frequently studied work attitudes is job satisfaction, often deﬁned as an affective reaction to one’s job (Fisher, 2000) or a pleasurable or emotional state resulting from an appraisal of one’s job (Locke, 1969). Theoretically, there are a number of reasons that personality should be predictive of job satisfaction. Perhaps the most straightforward explanation is that our natural resting state of E/PE or N/NE may affect our affective judgments about the world in which we work. For instance, individuals who are higher on the E/PE dimension may be more inclined to make a positive summary evaluation of the work environment. In contrast, individuals high on N/NE may be more inclined to make a negative summary eval- uation of the work environment.

Mood induction experiments provide some support for this proposition, especially with respect to negative affect. For instance, individuals with higher negative affect are more susceptible to a neg- ative mood induction than those low in negative affect (Larsen & Ketelaar, 1991) and more resistant to a positive mood induction (Brief, Butcher, & Roberson, 1995). Thus, individuals high on N/NE may have a predisposition to focus on what is negative in the work environment and ignore what is positive. A recent meta-analysis by Connolly and Viswesvaran (2000) conﬁrms that negative and positive affect are strongly related to job satisfaction. They found that the sample-size weighted corrected mean correlations of job satisfaction with positive and negative affect were, respectively, .49 and −.33. As we will explore more fully, the link between job satis- faction and various CWBs is well established. In particular, job sat- isfaction is negatively related to turnover (Carsten & Spector, 1987) and absenteeism (Hackett, 1989).

In closing this section, we note that Figure 6.1 posits that the at- titudinal and normative components of the theory of reasoned ac- tion both mediate and moderate the linkage between our set of work attitudes, perceptions, and emotions and CWBs. We have al- ready sought to explain the manner in which personality traits affect
