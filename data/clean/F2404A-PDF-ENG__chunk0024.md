## HBR / Magazine Article / Why Entrepreneurs Should Think Like Scientists

study, to determine whether the new idea had any viability. We spoke with

rental car companies and their customers about their pain points. We asked

whether a platform like the one we proposed would generate additional

interest in electric cars. Only 20% of the people we spoke with offered any

positive feedback. We were hoping for 60%.

Was that superfrustrating?

Yes, but we were happy to learn these lessons about our hypotheses early

on. Almost immediately after giving up on the second idea, I stumbled

upon a McKinsey report that said limiting Scope 3 carbon emissions—

which aren’t produced directly by a company but come indirectly from

things in its value chain—was the biggest challenge for sustainability-

minded corporations. When we investigated Scope 3 emissions, we learned

that employee commutes, business travel, and logistics are massive

contributors. We asked ourselves, “Can we develop a tracking system that

would give companies real-time access to this data?”

We interviewed sustainability managers. After three field interviews, we

knew we were on the right path. After 10 interviews, nine of the

conversations had been entirely positive.

What were the next steps that you took?

We had to prototype the idea and test it to determine whether it was

feasible in a real-world setting. We ran a six-month pilot with a company

that immediately became our first client once the pilot was complete.

And is your idea still viable?

Yes, but we will continue to test it and test it as we progress.
