## CONCLUSION: PERSISTENT ISSUES 79 REFERENCES 81

generally is conducted on either species or behavioral pat- terns not generally utilized in those ﬁelds. Comparative psy- chology ﬁts within the broad ﬁeld of animal behavior studies, which includes research by scientists from many disciplines. Much research within comparative psychology includes no overt comparisons among species. The goals are to develop a complete understanding of general principles governing mind and behavior including its origins (evolutionary, ge- netic, and developmental), control (internal and external), and consequences (for the individual, the surrounding envi- ronment, and for subsequent evolution). Comparison is but one method of reaching such understanding. Comparative psychologists take seriously the effects of behavior on differ- ential reproduction and, ultimately, evolutionary change. In an article on the contributions of comparative psychology to child study, a favorite approach of Hall’s, Linus Kline (1904) used the term zoological psychology as a label for the ﬁeld; this may be a more accurate descriptive title than compara- tive psychology because it highlights the connection of comparative psychology with zoology—especially so-called whole-animal biology.

In this chapter, I trace the history of comparative psychol- ogy from early cave paintings to the present. This entails ﬁrst a consideration of the British forerunners of comparative psy- chology and the emergence of the ﬁeld prior to World War I.
