# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 303

The differences among emotion, affect, mood, and personal- ity traits need to be clariﬁed. Lord and Kanfer (2002), for exam- ple, argue that emotions are different from mood, although affect, which they consider to be a more general term than emotion, can be either a mood or an emotion. Plutchik (1997) argues that emo- tion and personality variables are part of the same domain. Averill (1997) believes that emotions are characterized by three prototypic features—passivity (beyond personal control, almost), intention- ality (focused), and subjectivity (inner experiences)—and are or- ganized by researchers categorically (and often hierarchically, using terms such as sadness, pain, fear, and anxiety at the generic level) or dimensionally with two bipolar dimensions repeatedly used: evalu- ation (negative-positive) and activation (aroused-unaroused). He argues that personality traits play a prominent role in emotion and are at a higher (broader) level than emotions in the hierarchy of behavior. In spite of the already excellent thinking in this area, more research is needed to clarify the relationships among vari- ables in this (enlarged) domain.
