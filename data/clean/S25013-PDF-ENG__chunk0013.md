## The complexity of an explanation relative to the task’s also matters.

Research has shown that if an explanation indicates that the algorithm

seems too simplistic for a task—for instance, if the AI compared a scan

against just one image of a tumor to diagnose cancer—users may be less

likely to follow the AI’s guidance. However, an explanation that suggests

that the algorithm is complicated—perhaps saying that the AI compared
