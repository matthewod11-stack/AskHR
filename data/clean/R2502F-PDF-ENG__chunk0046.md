outcome. If I value risk and you value security, you can buy insurance from me. By leveraging diﬀerences in preferences—which are often

“I appreciate that you value saving face in this deal. I value stability

and predictability. Please let me know how I can help you, and please

share how you can help me so that we can both get what we want.” If you feel that this approach may be too direct, you can oﬀer a selection

of options—some that prioritize saving face and some that do not—and
