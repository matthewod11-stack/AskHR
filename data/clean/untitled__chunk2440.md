# Ecological Theory

for discussions about the person-in-context phenomenon at the 1965 Swampscott Conference (Klein, 1987). This Milbank conference surveyed nine research projects that ex- amined the epidemiology of mental disorders and advocated the use of community resources to address mental health issues. One project discussed was Erich Lindemann’s Human Relations Service of Wellesley. From his work on this project, Klein explicitly described some of the functions of the community and how these functions, such as providing and distributing living space and shelter, distributing neces- sary goods and services, maintaining safety and order, and educating and acculturating newcomers, could impact com- munity members. In this way, Lindemann and Klein took great steps toward establishing how the community could be seen and explored as a resource or strength in the develop- ment of individuals.

In the early 1960s, Seymour Sarason, a clinical psy- chologist by training, was showing psychologists how to do community-based work (Levine, Reppucci, & Weinstein, 1990; Reppucci, 1990; Sarason, 1995). The Yale Psycho- Educational Clinic that he directed illustrated an approach to intervention that targeted settings rather than individuals alone (Sarason, 1972, 1976; Sarason, Levine, Goldenberg, Cherlin, & Bennett, 1966). Sarason contributed greatly to the ﬁeld’s emphasis on contextual factors and made explicit the relationship between individual behavior and community set- tings. The innovative work of Sarason and Lindemann set the stage for ideas expressed at the Swampscott Conference more than 10 years later and fostered the work of future eco- logically minded community psychologists.
