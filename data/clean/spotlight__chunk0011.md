# SPOTLIGHT ON TOPIC

in 2015. Its new approach to performance manage- ment is aligned with its FastWorks platform for cre- ating products and bringing them to market, which borrows a lot from agile techniques. Supervisors still have an end-of-year summary discussion with sub- ordinates, but the goal is to push frequent conversa- tions with employees (GE calls them “touchpoints”) and keep revisiting two basic questions: What am I doing that I should keep doing? And what am I do- ing that I should change? Annual goals have been re- placed with shorter-term “priorities.” As with many of the companies we see, GE first launched a pilot, with about 87,000 employees in 2015, before adopt- ing the changes across the company.

The centrality of teamwork. Moving away from forced ranking and from appraisals’ focus on individual accountability makes it easier to fos- ter teamwork. This has become especially clear at retail companies like Sears and Gap—perhaps the most surprising early innovators in appraisals. Sophisticated customer service now requires front- line and back-office employees to work together to keep shelves stocked and manage customer flow, and traditional systems don’t enhance performance at the team level or help track collaboration.

Gap supervisors still give workers end-of-year assessments, but only to summarize performance discussions that happen throughout the year and to set pay increases accordingly. Employees still have goals, but as at other companies, the goals are short- term (in this case, quarterly). Now two years into its new system, Gap reports much greater satisfac- tion with its performance process and the best-ever

completion of store-level goals. Nontheless, Rob Ollander-Krane, Gap’s senior director of organiza- tion performance effectiveness, says the company needs further improvement in setting stretch goals and focusing on team performance.

Implications. All three reasons for dropping an- nual appraisals argue for a system that more closely follows the natural cycle of work. Ideally, conversa- tions between managers and employees occur when projects finish, milestones are reached, challenges pop up, and so forth—allowing people to solve prob- lems in current performance while also developing skills for the future. At most companies, managers take the lead in setting near-term goals, and employ- ees drive career conversations throughout the year. In the words of one Deloitte manager: “The conver- sations are more holistic. They’re about goals and strengths, not just about past performance.”

Perhaps most important, companies are over- hauling performance management because their businesses require the change. That’s true whether they’re professional services firms that must de- velop people in order to compete, companies that need to deliver ongoing performance feedback to support rapid innovation, or retailers that need bet- ter coordination between the sales floor and the back office to serve their customers.

Of course, many HR managers worry: If we can’t get supervisors to have good conversations with sub- ordinates once a year, how can we expect them to do so more frequently, without the support of the usual appraisal process? It’s a valid question—but we see reasons to be optimistic.

A TALENT MANAGEMENT TIMELINE The tug-of-war between accountability and development over the decades

■ Accountability focus ■ Development focus ■ A hybrid “third way”

WWI The U.S. military created merit- rating system to ﬂag and dismiss poor performers.

WWII The Army devised forced ranking to identify enlisted soldiers with the potential to become oﬃcers.

1940s About 60% of U.S. companies were using appraisals to document workers’ performance and allocate rewards.

1950s Social psychologist Douglas McGregor argued for engaging employees in assessments and goal setting.

1960s Led by General Electric, companies began splitting appraisals into separate discussions about accountability and growth, to give development its due.

1970s Inﬂation rates shot up, and organizations felt pressure to award merit pay more objectively, so accountability again became the priority in the appraisal process.

As GE found in 1964 and as research has docu- mented since, it is extraordinarily difficult to have a serious, open discussion about problems while also dishing out consequences such as low merit pay. The end-of-year review was also an excuse for delaying feedback until then, at which point both the supervi- sor and the employee were likely to have forgotten what had happened months earlier. Both of those constraints disappear when you take away the an- nual review. Additionally, almost all companies that have dropped traditional appraisals have invested in training supervisors to talk more about development with their employees—and they are checking with subordinates to make sure that’s happening.

Moving to an informal system requires a culture that will keep the continuous feedback going. As Megan Taylor, Adobe’s director of business part- nering, pointed out at a recent conference, it’s diffi- cult to sustain that if it’s not happening organically. Adobe, which has gone totally numberless but still gives merit increases based on informal assessments, reports that regular conversations between manag- ers and their employees are now occurring without HR’s prompting. Deloitte, too, has found that its new model of frequent, informal check-ins has led to more meaningful discussions, deeper insights, and greater employee satisfaction. (For more details, see “Reinventing Performance Management,” HBR, April 2015.) The firm started to go numberless like Adobe but then switched to assigning employees several numbers four times a year, to give them rolling feed- back on different dimensions. Jeffrey Orlando, who heads up development and performance at Deloitte,

1980s Jack Welch championed forced ranking at GE to reward top performers, accommodate those in the middle, and get rid of those at the bottom.

1990s McKinsey’s War for Talent study pointed to a shortage of capable executives and reinforced the emphasis on assessing and rewarding performance.

2000 Organizations got ﬂatter, which dramatically increased the number of direct reports each manager had, making it harder to invest time in developing them.
