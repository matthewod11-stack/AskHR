compensation models must evolve, rewarding strategiccontribution and client outcomes over billable hours.This new model also raises important questions around AIgovernance and ethics. In traditional consulting, clientdeliverables typically passed through layers of review by analysts,senior consultants, managers, and partners, making it easier tocatch issues and assign responsibility. But in the obelisk model,where small teams move quickly and AI plays a larger role indecision-making, new approaches will be needed to ensure thatAI-powered decisions are understandable, equitable, and made bypeople who are clearly accountable.One of us (Jeffrey Saviano), is a former EY partner who now leadsa research team developing new models for AI governance andethics at Harvard’s

Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics, aninstitution focused on strengthening research and teaching onethical issues. Its work emphasizes the need for business leadersto take responsibility for governing AI themselves versus waitingfor government regulation. That means building ethicalguardrails into how AI is used, not relying solely on centralizedcompliance teams or after-the-fact reviews. We’ve seen how this isespecially important in the obelisk model, where ethicalaccountability must be clear, distributed, and embedded directlyinto team workflows—especially as small expert teams areempowered by tools capable of influencing high-stakes decisions.Despite the challenges for consultancies, this is not a moment forincrementalism. The winners will be those who move first andreimagine the industry before someone else does it for them.
