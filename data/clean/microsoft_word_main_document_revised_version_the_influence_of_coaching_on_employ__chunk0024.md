# 5.3 Results

After the measuring model was deemed to be acceptable, we tested the main hypothesis using stepwise linear regression. First, we introduced control variables to the regression (tenure with the company, tenure in the position, and years of sales experience). In the following step we introduced the main effect (coaching) and assessed its effect on the dependent variable (performance) by analyzing whether the additional explained variance in the dependent variable was significant or not.

As hypothesized, coaching positively affects performance (β = .280, p < .05 for sample 1, and β = .200, p < .05 for sample 2) in support of our main hypothesis. The percentage of variance explained of the dependent variable once 2 = .062 for sample the effect of the control variables was eliminated was small but significant for both samples (∆radj 2 = .029 for sample 2) thus, suggesting that the use of coaching by the manager can have a significant 1 and ∆radj positive effect on salesperson performance (Table 4).
