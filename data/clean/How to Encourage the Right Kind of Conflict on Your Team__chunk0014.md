One of the advantages of naming these tensions is that youseparate the people from the problem. This is one of the coretenets of the

Principled Negotiation approach, popularized by theHarvard Law School Program on Negotiation.Another way to do this is to ask people to argue against their ownstandpoint. You can ask Kiyo to argue for why the team shouldslow down and Rebecca to argue for why it’s OK to compromise abit on quality. This will help them see one another’s perspective(even if only briefly) and it will help the rest of the teamdisconnect one particular argument from a single person.Here are some questions you can use in a discussion like this oneto keep the disagreement healthy:

Is there another angle that we’re missing here?

What are the pros and cons of perspective A (then perspectiveB)?

If we were able to remove the constraints we’re under, howwould this discussion change?

What would a middle ground between these perspectives looklike? What tradeoﬀs would we need to make to achieve that?

Lastly, one of the most critical things you can do as a leader is todisplay comfort when conflicts arise. I’ve heard people say, “Aleader’s whisper is heard as a shout,” emphasizing the significantweight and impact of your words. Whether you want it or not,your perceived power and authority over others means they turnto you for signals of whether something is ok or not. If you clamup, turn red in the face, become curt when a disagreement arises,
