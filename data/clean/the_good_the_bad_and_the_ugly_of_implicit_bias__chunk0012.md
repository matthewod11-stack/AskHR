Driving gender equity in African scientiﬁc institutions

Women scientists have a vital part to play in scientiﬁc leadership and in contributing to Africa’s development and transformation, but they remain substantially under-represented in higher education and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Women account for 53% of the world’s bachelor’s and master’s degree graduates and 43% of PhD graduates, but only 28% of researchers in all ﬁelds.1 Only 30% of women in higher education move into STEM-related ﬁelds.2 Similarly, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 30% of researchers in all subject areas are women.3 For example, in Cameroon, enrolment in tertiary education was estimated at 20% for men and 15% for women in 2017,3,4 and women constituted only 22% of Cameroonian researchers and only 7% of academics at the rank of

full professor.5 Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase in the percentage of women researchers in South Africa (43·7%), Egypt (42·8%), Morocco (30·2%), Senegal (24·9%), Nigeria (23·3%), Rwanda (21·8%), Cameroon (21·8%), and Ethiopia (13·3%).6,7 However, there is an attrition in the number of women along the career trajectory in scientiﬁc research.1 Gender disparities persist in the scientiﬁc workforce, generally concentrating female scientists in the lower echelons of responsibility and decision making with limited leadership opportunities.7 This situation limits the diverse perspectives that ensure robust scientiﬁc agendas and allow women’s contributions and advancement.

A gender lens is therefore necessary for recognising input and needs for development. Some women’s examples of best practices for tracking and closing the gender equity gap in STEM in Africa have begun to emerge, which alongside structural change can help bring transformation.

The UNESCO STEM And Gender Advancement (SAGA) project aims to contribute to improving the situation of women and reducing the STEM gender gap in education and research. SAGA assesses sex-disaggregated data and supports the design and implementation of science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy instruments that aﬀect gender equality.

To track and monitor women’s representation, the African Development Bank’s gender equality index captures progress on the appointment of women to posts of responsibility. The index portrays the legal, social, and economic gaps between men and women,
