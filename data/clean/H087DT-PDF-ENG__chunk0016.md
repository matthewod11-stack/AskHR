# Bipolar disorder

Some folks with mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder, struggle a

great deal when their rhythms are disrupted — for example, if you’re

asked to do shift work or to take an early-morning ﬂight to a conference.

If you need a consistent schedule for your mental health, consider

asking your boss what adaptations are possible.
