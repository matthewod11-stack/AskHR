Google has such a system in place. In 2020, the company’s CEO, Sundar

Pichai, advised employees about an opt-in program that would track

staﬀers’ locations through an emergency notiﬁcation system run by its

security team, known as the Global Security and Resilience Services

(GSRS). The system tracks and reaches out to employees in areas

aﬀected by diﬀerent health, climate, and security risks to oﬀer guidance

and support, and the GSRS team organizes tips for employees on

preparing for poor air quality, evacuations, and power outages. During

widespread wildﬁres in 2023, for example, Google advised employees on

personal safety measures, including work-from-home advisories to limit

exposure to outdoor air.
