LePine (2005) conducted another intriguing goal-setting and goal-orientation study, using a decision-making simulation to study the ability of teams to adapt to changing circumstances. When conditions changed so that team members had to change the way they communicated, the teams that adapted best were those that had high goals as well as a high score on a learning- orientation trait scale. Setting high goals was actually harmful if the teams scored low on the measure of learning orientation.
