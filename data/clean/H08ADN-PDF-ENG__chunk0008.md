## Psychological Safety: Lost When Needed Most

Decades of psychological safety research underscore its role in helping

people learn, collaborate, and perform at work. By reducing the fear

of being seen as ignorant or inept, psychological safety enables the

learning behaviors that are integral to settling into a new role and

organization, such as asking a question or seeking help. Psychological

safety is important for new hires because it allows them to manage the

discomfort of admitting fallibility, confront a steep learning curve on

new tasks, and embrace new perspectives.

Our latest research reveals a fascinating, if concerning, pattern for

psychological safety. We studied more than 10,000 employees in a large

organization and discovered that new hires’ psychological safety eroded

swiftly. On average, newcomers joined the organization with higher

psychological safety relative to their more tenured colleagues, then lost

it and waited years to reach levels comparable to when they arrived.
