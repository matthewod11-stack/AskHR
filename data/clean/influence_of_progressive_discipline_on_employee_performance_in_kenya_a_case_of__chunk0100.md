formal grievance (37%) or disciplinary procedure (31%). An even larger proportion of workplaces did not implement the three steps as outlined in the dispute resolution regulations. This problem was particularly acute in the case of micro firms with less than ten employees (Forth et al., 2006).The regulations were clearly aimed at reducing the number of employment tribunal forcing employers and, most claims by importantly, employees to exhaust internal procedures before resorting to an employment tribunal claim (Department of Trade and Industry, 2001). Between 2003/4 and 2005/6 the number of single employment tribunal claims fell from 65,364 to 52,000. However whether this was due to more effective workplace dispute resolution, or simply the increased difficulty of making a claim, is questionable (Suff et al., 2006).

Hepple & Morris (2002) suggested that the impact of the procedural changes introduced under the Employment Act 2002 downgraded rather than enhanced procedural fairness. They argued that the statutory procedures fell well short of best practice reflected by the Acas Code of Practice. Furthermore, as long as the employer followed the statutory procedure they could escape a finding of unfair dismissal on the grounds that procedural defects would have

Even so, employers complained that the regulations increased both administration and the incidence of workplace disputes (Gibbons, 2007). Indeed in 2006/7, single employment tribunal claims rose by 3% while the number of those with multiple all claims (Employment claimants) Tribunal Service, 2007).

The Gibbons Review (Gibbons, 2007) and the publication of the Employment Bill 2007-8 have concentrated attention on ways in which employment disputes can be resolved in the workplace. However, one aspect that has received relatively little attention is the impact on reprimand of accompaniment and representation within both formal and informal aspects of disciplinary and grievance processes. Therefore, the study sought to remedy this omission by examining whether representation and accompaniment can help to resolve disputes and moderate disciplinary outcomes as pertaining to employee reprimand systems.
