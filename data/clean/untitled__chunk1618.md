# 276 Educational Psychology

in motivational theories has grown tremendously over the past decade, and it is common for many current publications and textbooks in the ﬁeld of educational psychology to in- clude substantial text devoted to both the theory and practice of motivation and the regulation of motivation (Alexander, 2000).

Much of the contemporary conﬂict within the discipline of educational psychology can be better understood when dif- ferences in epistemological stances are taken into account (O’Donnell & Levin, 2001). As O’Donnell and Levin sug- gest, there are essentially two epistemological stances, result- ing in two different research traditions. Some educational psychologists take the positivistic or postpositivist position. These researchers emphasize explanation, prediction, and control, and research often focuses on hypotheses and exper- iments. Researchers with a preference for critical theory and constructivism have more interest in arriving at an under- standing of the construct under study. Because the method used in this research is frequently qualitative, the increased understanding of the construct often occurs on the part of both the researcher and the participant (McCaslin & Hickey, 2001; O’Donnell & Levin, 2001). As Pintrich (2000b) notes, educational psychologists should, however, be well beyond the quantitative-qualitative debate. Instead, our concern should now be on providing valid and reliable evidence that supports our conceptual models and conclusions.
