# REFERENCES 531

events are recalled, ending with a commentary on the increas- ing internationalization of psychology.

Speciﬁcally discussed will be (a) the 1913 Congress that wasn’t, (b) the U.S. Congress held in Canada, (c) the Young Psychologists’ initiative, (d) differing views on human rights, (e) visas and ﬂags, (f) psychologists’ evolving stands on social issues, and (g) the trend from Americanization to internationalization.

The second part of the chapter is a table that consists of a chronology of events inﬂuencing international psychology, similar to the format pioneered by Street (1994). Included are the founding of psychological laboratories and institutes, national psychological organizations, journals, and ﬁrst con- gresses. Also cited are unique events of historical interest that reﬂect on the tenor of the times. The language used depends upon the sources. We assume responsibility for any inadver- tent errors.

Writing about the history of international psychology dif- fers from reviewing historical developments in psychological subspecialties. Rather than being a distinct ﬁeld, international psychology spans the entire discipline. When well-informed colleagues were asked what they meant when using the term “international psychology,” the typical response referred to international congresses, travel, and specialized meetings as well as exchanges, collaborative multicultural research and practice, and the application of psychological principles to the development of public policy (David & Buchanan, 1999). As noted by Denmark (1987), the term “international psy- chology” may also refer to social psychological studies of international relations or cross-cultural research.
