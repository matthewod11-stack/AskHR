# Gender, Ethnicity, and Race

Much of the research on gender and stress is conflicting. Many studies suggest that women have more stress than men and that depression is twice as com- mon among them. Other studies claim that gender is not a contributor to stress. Presently, perhaps the best interpretation of the research on sex and stress is that women may experience certain stressors more often than men (e.g., sexual harassment, work/family conflict), and men and women may react differently to certain types of stressors (Sulsky & Smith, ).

Though there is not much research on the topic, it appears that members of minority groups have higher levels of stress than do nonminorities (Sulsky & Smith, ). Furthermore, racial and ethnic differences mostly concern physical reactions to stress. For example, African American men seem to experience higher rates of hypertension than White men.
