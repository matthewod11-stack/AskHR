## Evaluating an Appraisal Form Used in Higher Education

Consider the appraisal form shown below, which is a form used by a university in the United States for non-faculty staff members. First, use the table to place check marks next to each component that is present. Second, in the Comments section, please write, (1) for those components that are

present, whether any changes or revisions are needed in the form and why and, (2) for those components that are absent, why they should be added and what are the possible negative consequences of not doing so. (cid:2)
