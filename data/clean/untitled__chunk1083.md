# Sociology and Social Work

Sociologists also contributed to the personality literature dur- ing the early decades of the twentieth century (Barenbaum, 2000; Becker, 1930) and maintained an active interest in per- sonality thereafter (Bernard, 1945). Their contributions have received little systematic attention in historical discussions of personality psychology. (For exceptions, see Burnham, 1968a, on the inﬂuence of sociology and social philosophy on the development of personality psychology; Runyan, 1982, on sociological contributions to the study of life histo- ries; and Smith, 1997, on personality research as a focus of sociological and psychological social psychologists during the 1930s.)

The adoption in 1921 of a system for classifying abstracts of recent literature published in the American Journal of So- ciology was one indication of sociologists’interest in person- ality. The “tentative scheme” included as a ﬁrst category “Personality: The Individual and the Person” (“Recent Liter- ature,” 1921, p. 128; in contrast, the Psychological Index and Psychological Abstracts did not include “personality” in their classiﬁcation schemes until 1929 and 1934, respectively). A subcategory for “Biography” (p. 128) as well as the category “Social Pathology: Personal and Social Disorganization” and two methodological subcategories, “Case Studies and Social Diagnosis” and “Life-Histories and Psychoanalysis” (p. 129), reﬂected sociologists’ attention to studies of individual lives, an interest they shared with social workers, psychiatrists, and psychoanalysts.

Case study and life history methods, including the use of personal documents, drew attention in sociology following the publication of Thomas and Znaniecki’s (1918–1920)
