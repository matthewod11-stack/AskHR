## Audit job descriptions against actual interviews. Organizations should

regularly review whether their interview processes actually assess the

skills they claim to value. This audit should examine whether skills are not just mentioned but evaluated in suﬃcient depth.

Integrate AI assessment into hiring practices. Given the technology’s

growing importance, companies should develop speciﬁc strategies

for evaluating candidates’ AI capabilities, comfort with technological

change, and potential for developing AI-related skills.
