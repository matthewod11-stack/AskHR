Yunus founded Grameen Bank, the ﬁrst microﬁnance institution, with

the requirement that at least ﬁve villagers had to come together to form

a mutually supportive unit before the bank would extend a tiny loan to

one member designated by the group. Only after that person regularly

repaid the loan for several months could another member of the group

request a loan. This practice created not-so-subtle peer pressure for

no member to default and naturally incentivized groups to select only

members who feel a sense of kinship and a high moral obligation to not

let the other members down. The codependence also inspired members

to step up and help any member of the group who may be struggling,

making each borrower more reliable in the process.

consistently above 90%. Furthermore, it took the costs attached to loan
