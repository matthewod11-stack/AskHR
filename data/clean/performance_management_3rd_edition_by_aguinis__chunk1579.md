In spite of the need to address poor performance, managers are usually not very comfortable providing negative feedback. Why is this so? Consider the following reasons:

- Negative reactions and consequences. Managers may fear that employees will react negatively. Negative reactions can include being defensive and even becoming angry at the information received. In addition, managers may fear that the work- ing relationship, or even friendship, with their subordinates may be affected adversely and that giving negative feedback can introduce elements of mistrust and annoyance.

- Negative experiences in the past. Managers themselves may have received negative feedback at some point in their careers and have experienced firsthand how feelings can be hurt. Receiving negative feedback can be painful and upsetting, and managers may not want to put their subordinates in such a situation.

Because this task may be perceived as too onerous, managers may choose to skip giving negative feedback altogether.

What happens when managers avoid giving negative feedback and employees avoid seeking it?

When performance problems exist, they are likely to become more intense over time. For example, clients may be so dissatisfied with the service they are receiving that they may eventually choose to close their accounts and work instead with the competition. At that time, it becomes impossible for the manager to overlook the performance problem, and she has no choice but to deliver
