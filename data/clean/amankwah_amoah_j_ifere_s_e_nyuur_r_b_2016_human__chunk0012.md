## Explanations for persistence with underperforming workers: a unified perspective

For analytical clarity, underperforming workers are employees who have consistently

performed below targets or previously agreed benchmarks over a period of time in their

organisation (Shein, 2011). The underperformance has often been documented through a

series of reviews by his or her line manager (Shein, 2011; Taylor, 1998). Some of the

characteristics of such employees include lack of up-to-date communication skills, and lack

of knowledge and expertise to perform in the current role (Taylor, 1998). Underperforming

workers have been referred to as underperforming human resources or incompetent workers

(Shein, 2011; Taylor, 1998).

Four important streams of research are utilised to provide the foundation towards a

better understanding of persistence with underperforming workers. First, we adopt the

concept of the paradox of success (Audia et al., 2000; Miller, 1990) to develop a novel

perspective on persistence with underperforming workers. The paradox of success is rooted

in the “belief that a previously winning course of action will succeed in the future” (Audia et

al., 2000, p. 850). A key tenet is that the workers develop what can be referred to as
