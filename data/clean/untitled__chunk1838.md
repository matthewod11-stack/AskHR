# 322 Abnormal Psychology

neuropathy can be found in genuinely hysterical patients. In 1890 Janet succeeded Charcot as head of the psychological laboratory.

Janet assumed that mental pathology is determined by the functional features of the brain and a weakened and poorly integrated nervous system. In order to determine whether sexual factors are important in the etiology of hysteria, he examined 120 hysterical patients. He found a preeminently erotic disposition in only four and concluded that hysterical patients are generally too self-centered and emotionally re- stricted to be preoccupied with sexual interests. Janet empha- sized the importance of psychogenic or “ideogenic” causes in the etiology of hysteria and criticize Freud’s insistence on a universal psychosexual etiology of the neuroses. He traced hysterical symptoms to a system of “ﬁxed ideas” that con- centrated in one ﬁeld of consciousness and controlled the pa- tient’s mental life. The ﬁxed ideas “may develop completely during the attacks of hysteria and express themselves then by acts and words” (Janet, 1892/1977), and are also revealed in dreams, “natural somnambulisms,” and hypnotic states. The ﬁxed ideas, over which the patient has no control, arise from a persisting traumatic memory of a series of emotionally dis- tressing events that the patient appears to have completely forgotten, but that can be remembered in a hypnotic state.

Janet claimed that when the patient was able to express the traumatic memories, the symptoms improved or disappeared. One of his therapeutic techniques involved asking his pa- tients, usually under hypnosis, to describe the circumstances in which a symptom ﬁrst occurred. Then, to eliminate the symptom, he gave the patient a direct hypnotic suggestion thatthecircumstancesthepatientrecalledhadnotactuallyoc- curred. His success in treating hysterical patients with a com- bination of hypnosis and psychological analysis led him to devise a treatment plan for various types of hysterical symp- toms. He stressed that each patient must be treated as a unique case, not in terms of a generalized psychological theory.
