## Writing in Harvard Business Review in 2011, Gökçe Sargut and Rita

McGrath explained the diﬀerence this way: In complicated systems,

“there are many interactions within it, but they usually follow a pattern.

It’s possible to make predictions about how a complicated system will

behave,” citing the example of an electrical grid. Complex systems, in

contrast, are “imbued with features that may operate in patterned ways

but whose interactions are continually changing.” For example, they point to air traﬃc control systems in which objects are in constant

motion, conditions can change rapidly, and these interactions make it diﬃcult to predict outcomes.

Building on their distinction, problems can be viewed on a spectrum

from complicated to complex, based on the following key dimensions:

- Predictability: Complicated problems are predictable; they follow

established patterns and their outcomes can be forecasted

with reasonable conﬁdence. In contrast, complex problems are

unpredictable, with outcomes that emerge from numerous interacting
