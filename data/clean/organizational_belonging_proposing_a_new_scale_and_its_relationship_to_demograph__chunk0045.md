# JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

Outcomes Two one-item variables were measured, productivity and intent to stay. Productivity was measured by asking “I feel productive in my position at work.” Intent to stay was measured by the item “I plan to stay at this organization for the foreseeable future.” Both variables used the same six- point scale, 1¼strongly disagree to 6¼strongly agree. Prior work has used similar items, e.g., Huynh et al. (2012).
