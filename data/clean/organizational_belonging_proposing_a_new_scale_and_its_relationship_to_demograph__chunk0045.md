Organization variables Two variables were measured: organization tenure and position level/role. Organization tenure was measured by asking “how long have you worked at your organization?” where 1¼less than one year, 2¼1–4years, 3¼5– 9years, 4¼10–20years, 5¼more than 20years. Position level/role was meas- ured by asking “choose the position level that most aligns with your role in the organization,” where 1¼owner/partner, 2¼C-Suite, 3¼Vice President, staff, 7¼Consultant, 4¼Director, 5¼Manager/supervisor, 6¼Technical 8¼Sales, 9¼Administrative support, 10¼Other (fill in).

OB items Twenty-seven items were used. Items were taken from three different sour- ces. The first source was prior empirical work noted in the literature review: (items adapted for use), e.g., (feeling accepted; opinion valued), Hagerty and Patusky (1995) and Malone et al. (2012); (sense of belonging), Edwards and Peccei (2007), Huynh et al. (2012), and Van Dyne and Pierce (2004); (feeling included), Stamper and Masterson (2002); and (being an outsider), Malone et al. (2012). This represented ten items. The second source was based on the “themes” generated in qualitative studies, i.e., Belle et al. (2015), Filstad et al. (2019), McClure and Brown (2008), and Herbert (2020) which were translated into more specific items, e.g., being authentic; to engage fully; acceptance of oneself; cohesion with others; differences being appreciated and honored; and connecting with colleagues. This repre- sented eight items. The third source for items was a survey by the American Institute for Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA, 2022). The AICPA has a toolkit for diversity and inclusion in firms, which includes items measuring attitudes toward diversity and inclusion, belong- ing, and discrimination. As a member of AICPA, the third coauthor had access to the toolkit and was allowed to adapt relevant nine sample diver- sity and inclusion survey items.

To the authors’ knowledge, these sampled AICPA survey items have never been utilized in published research. A six-point response scale was used for all items, where 1¼strongly disagree to 6¼strongly agree, with no neutral point. These items are presented in Table 2.
