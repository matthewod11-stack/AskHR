# 126 PERSONALITY AND WORK

We believe that the literature can be characterized by four major

observations that are relevant to the objectives of this chapter:

- 1. In the literature on personality and affect in work settings, af- fective experiences are frequently studied not as affect itself but as related constructs, such as job satisfaction and psycho- logical strain.

- 2. Studies of personality and affective reactions in organizational settings have primarily involved the examination of aggregate affective constructs as dependent variables.

- 3. The general format for studying affect-related experiences in- volves cross-sectional questionnaire studies that are unable to capture the affect process as it unfolds over time.

- 4. Affective experiences and personality variables create a murky pool in which there is no clear distinction between a stable characteristic and an experience in progress.

Our ﬁrst point is that many organizational studies on person- ality and affect have examined such things as job satisfaction (Bluen, Barling, & Burns, 1990; Fisher, 2000; Hart, 1999; Judge, Locke, & Durham, 1997; Porac, Ferris, & Fedor, 1983), psycholog- ical strain (Chen & Spector, 1991; Jex & Bliese, 1999; Saks & Ash- forth, 2000), and burnout (Wright & Cropanzano, 1998; Zellars & Perrewe, 2001); fewer have looked at emotions or moods at work. Although these regularly studied phenomena are potentially in- ﬂuenced by affective experiences and are related conceptually, they are not the same as actual affective experiences (Weiss, 2002a). Job satisfaction is a good example.

Job satisfaction is an attitude, not an affective state. As an atti- tude, it is best conceptualized as an evaluation of one’s job, inﬂu- enced in part by affective events that have occurred at work (Weiss, 2002b; Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996) and, as a source of error, the mood one is in at the time of making the evaluation (Brief, Butcher, & Roberson, 1995). In addition, most measures of job satisfac- tion have a large cognitive component (Brief & Roberson, 1989). The studies reviewed often used highly cognitive measures, such as
