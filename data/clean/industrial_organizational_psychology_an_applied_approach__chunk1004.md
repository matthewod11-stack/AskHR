chapter 

point out that each interviewer will be taking notes and scoring the answers immediately after the interviewee has responded. After the agenda has been established, ask the interview questions. You may want to have only one per- son ask all of the questions or have each panel member ask some questions. It is important to score each answer after it has been given. Once the questions have been asked, provide information about the job and the organization. Such information might include salary and benefits, the job duties, opportunities for advancement, a history of the organization, and so on. Then, answer any ques- tions the applicant might have. It is a good idea at this point to say something like, “We have asked you a lot of questions but may not have asked you about things you want to tell us. Is there any information you would like to tell us that we did not ask about?” End the interview on a pleasant note by complimenting the interviewee (“It was a pleasure meeting you”) and letting her know when you will be contacting the applicant about job offers. At the conclusion of the interview, the scores from the questions are summed and the resulting figure is the applicant’s interview score.
