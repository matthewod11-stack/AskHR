Following the implementation of stringent lockdown measures during the initial wave of the pandemic, the Internet became the default mode of communication and continues to be a major platform for work, classes, con- sultations, shopping, and socializing (Regalado et al., 2022). Consequently, we have seen what is known as a ‘‘transition’’ to the digital world (Miro´ -Llinares & Moneva, 2019; Monteith et al., 2021; Plachkinova, 2021). Organizations’ reactions to this tran- sition often lead to botched cultural change processes (Spicer, 2020).
