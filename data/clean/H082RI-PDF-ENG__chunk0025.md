# non-binary and MENA.

Some decision makers may wonder whether including more expansive

identity options, like a non-binary gender option, may send negative

signals to members of majority groups in that demographic category,

like men or women. Our research suggests this may not be a

large concern. In a follow-up study, we explored whether men and

women respondents reported lower feelings of likely belonging in a

company when mock job applications included (and did not include)

a non-binary gender option. We found that inserting the non-binary

gender option did not impact men’s and women’s anticipated sense

of belonging at the company, suggesting that there may be limited

downsides to using more inclusive identiﬁcation options.

Finally, with respect to demographics used in internal surveys,

organizations interested in avoiding identity omission might consider

surveying a subset of their employees and asking them to indicate their

identities using open-ended, written responses. Organizations could use

data like this to get a better understanding of the diﬀerent identities

their employees may wish to see included as response options in

internal forms. Data like this could also serve as a useful check against

information stored in internal HR systems.

- 2. Broaden the response formats used.

When designing demographics forms, organizations may also beneﬁt

from considering whether a standard, multiple-choice format — where multiple options are provided and only one can be selected

— is required. Several alternative response formats may be viable.

First, when soliciting racial or ethnic identity information in internal

surveys and external applications, organizations may consider allowing

respondents to select as many options as they wish to identify

themselves — using a “select all that apply” rather than a “check one”
