# Happiness and Employee Retention

As reported by Douglas (1918), W.A. Grieve of the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company conducted the ﬁrst scientiﬁc empirical investigation of employee retention in December 1914. In his ground-breaking research, Grieves examined the personnel ﬁles of 20 mid-western metal plants and found a rather substantial annual turnover rate of 157%. A number of other early studies reported similarly low rates of retention, with Frost (1920, p. 20) reporting turnover rates ranging from 0 to 8,000%! With these rates of turnover, researchers early on recognized that the beneﬁts of employee retention were quite consequential for both the individual and organization (Snow, 1923).

In an interesting historical twist, unlike the more recent fascination with the role of PWB on job performance (Wright, 2005), early, applied research was very interested in the possible role played by PWB on employee withdrawal decisions. Fisher and Hanna’s (1931) inﬂuential work on the ‘‘dissatisﬁed worker’’ is indicative of this early recognition that employee PWB strongly inﬂuences the potential for subsequent employee withdrawal. As strong testament to this recognition, Fisher and Hanna devoted an entire chapter of their seminal book to the role of employee emotional adjustment or well- being on employee withdrawal. More speciﬁcally, they noted that employee well-being was ‘‘responsible to a much greater extent for labor turnover than is commonly realized’’(1931, p. 233). Their interest in the role of employee psychological or emotional well-being in employee withdrawal decisions was
