## even purely domestic players like hospitals and power companies. AI

has accelerated the cybersecurity arms race, with both attackers and

defenders using it.

It’s urgent to audit your cyber defenses, which, in our experience,

needs to be done from inside-out (testing and upgrading current

plans) and outside-in (auditing or stress-testing by an objective expert).

That should include an initiative to begin, dust oﬀ, or level-up third-

party risk management (TPRM). Data from Verizon shows that the

percentage of cyber breaches coming via third parties has doubled

in the last year. Companies therefore need better supplier monitoring

and diversiﬁcation and stronger capabilities in scenario planning,

wargaming, contract analysis, and so on so that they can rank suppliers

on a full spectrum of risk. Many outside advisors (disclosure: including

our company, AlixPartners) can do this quickly, using AI to speed up risk

scoring for Tier One, Tier Two, and even Tier Three suppliers; advanced

programs are even able to predict problems.
