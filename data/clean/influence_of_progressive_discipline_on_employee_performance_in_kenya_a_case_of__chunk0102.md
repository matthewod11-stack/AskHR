Sally et al,(2004) did a study on Ethical trade in African horticulture: rights and Participation in flower farms in Kenya, South Africa and Zambia. As indicated, most producers recognized the importance of good employment practices and seemed genuinely committed to making improvements. However, what emerged from the research was that they sometimes had a limited understanding of the problems that their workers faced. To some extent codes (including audits against codes) had helped raise awareness of certain potential issues, such as discrimination and sexual harassment, but in general producers were making changes based on their own perceptions and not those of workers. Very few workers in our study had any knowledge of codes, despite the fact that some companies had been implementing them for several years. Most of those that did thought they related only to technical specifications, with only a few aware that there were codes covering (cid:449)orkers(cid:859) rights.

countries workers had generally not been involved in the implementation of codes.

Griffin and Mahon (1997) supported the theory of the positive code of ethics and financial performance relationship with findings from their research. They demonstrated this by studying and classifying the results of 62 studies, into three spanning 25 years of research, categories; no negative positive, effect/inconclusive. They identified 33 results that found a positive relationship, 20 with negative results and 9 which found no relationship or were inconclusive.With respect to the relationship between code of ethics and financial performance, Curtis C. (1998) found that companies publicly committing to follow an ethics code as an internal control strategy achieved significantly higher performance measured in both financial and non-financial terms. Similarly, Berrone et al (2005) in their
