# Informal Communication

An interesting type of organizational communication is informal communication. Often, informal information is transmitted through the grapevine, a term that can be traced back to the Civil War, when loosely hung telegraph wires resembled grapevines. The communication across these lines was often distorted. Because unofficial employee communication is also thought to be distorted, the term has become synonymous with an informal communication network (Davis, ). Grapevines are common because they provide employees with information, power, and entertainment (Kurland & Pelled, ). Not surprisingly, the increased use of email has increased the importance of the grapevine (Smith, ).

Davis () studied the grapevine and established the existence of four grapevine patterns: single strand, gossip, probability, and cluster. As Figure . shows, in the single-strand grapevine, Jones passes a message to Smith, who passes the message to Brown, and so on until the message is received by everyone or someone “breaks the chain.” This pattern is similar to the children’s game of “telephone.” In the gossip grapevine, Jones passes the message to only a select group of people. Notice that with this pattern only one person passes the message along, and not everyone has a chance to receive, or will receive, it. In the prob- ability grapevine, Jones tells the message to a few other employees, and they in turn randomly pass the message along to other employees. In the cluster grape- vine, Jones tells only a few select employees, who in turn tell a few select others.

Research on the grapevine has supported several of Davis’s () findings. Sutton and Porter () studied  employees in a state tax office and reached several interesting conclusions. They found that employees could be placed into one of three categories. Isolates were employees who received less than half of the information, liaisons were employees who both received most of the information
