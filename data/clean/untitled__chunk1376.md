# Making and Finding Social Relevance

Another stream of research entailed the study of “attitudes,” which in 1935 Gordon Allport called “the most distinctive and indispensable concept in American social psychology” (p. 798). Scientiﬁc study of attitudes shared kinship with Progressive ideals to scientiﬁcally assess beliefs and opinions of the populace and ultimately was to have political and com- mercial uses, especially in advertising and marketing (Lears, 1992). It is through controlled, quantitative attitude studies that social psychologists signiﬁcantly reﬁned their experi- mental techniques of control and numeric exactitude, notably through development of sampling techniques, psychometric scales, questionnaire formats, and technical approaches to assessing reliability and validity (Katz, 1988). In his 1932 re- view of social psychology L. L. Bernard wrote, “Scale and test making is almost a science in itself utilized by social psy- chologists in common with the educationists [sic], the indus- trial and business management people, and in fact by most of the vocational interests in the United States” (p. 279). Bernard detected the wide-scale market value of these psy- chological technologies, especially their compatibility with and rising ethos of quantiﬁcation: “There is a strong tendency in this country to ﬁnd a method of measuring all forms of behavior and nothing is regarded as a demonstrated fact in social psychology or elsewhere until it has been measured or counted and classiﬁed” (p. 279).

In the 1930s social psychology’s original aim of aiding social welfare, albeit muted by intensive efforts to realize the challenging goal of experimentation on social processes, became more pronounced. Throughout the remainder of the century social psychology would exhibit similar swings back and forth between worldly or political aspirations and scientiﬁc ones (Apfelbaum, 1986, p. 10). Aswing was in- deed occurring in this decade: Psychologist-turned-journalist Grace Adams (1934) chided psychologists for their failure to predict the stock market crash of 1929 culminating in world- wide depression, but soon after social psychologists perse- vered in probing the depression’s complex social effects. The commitment to investigations that more or less directly serve social betterment grew wider in the 1930s and 1940s. How- ever visible these reformist efforts, historians disagree about the political philosophy underlying the research: Whereas some scholars assume the philosophical basis was simply ob- jective science applied to nonlaboratory conditions, others see a more engaged politics, including a benignly democra- tic, elitist “democratic social engineering” or “New Deal” liberalism (Graebner, 1980; Richards, 1996; van Elteren, 1993). The political atmosphere certainly included a sense of professional survival as evidenced by psychologists’ mobi- lization to create an organization devoted to studying social problems, the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (Finison, 1976, 1979; Napoli, 1975).

Aggression was a prime social problem identiﬁed in the 1930s, and the researchers who formulated what was to be- come a dominant view in aggression research, the frustration- aggressionhypothesis,retrospectivelyproducedalistofevents thatprecipitatedtheresearch.Inadditiontothedepression,the listincludedtheSpanishCivilWar,racismandthecastesystem of the South, anti-Semitism in Germany, and labor unrest and strikes. Combining the odd bedfellows of behavior theory and Freudianpsychoanalysis,agroupofYaleUniversitypsycholo- gists hypothesized “that the occurrence of aggressive behavior always presupposes the existence of frustration and, contrari- wise, that the existence of frustration always leads to some form of aggression” (Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer, & Sears, 1939). Extended to studies of concrete situations—frustrated laboratory rats, poor southerners, unemployed husbands, and adolescents—the frustration-aggression hypothesis consti- tutedatruly“sociallyrelevant”socialpsychology.Thehypoth- esispressedaviewofthesocialindividualasnotalwaysaware of his or her actions, as motivated by factors about which he or she was not fully conscious.

Political and professional affairs inspired social psycholo- gists to engage more directly in social-action-related research; also inﬂuencing such research was the formation of a more

ethnically diverse research community, including Jewish émigrés who had ﬂed Germany and whose backgrounds en- taileddramaticallydifferentpersonalexperiencesandintellec- tual beliefs. Franz Samelson (1978) has suggested that these newethnicdimensions,includingresearchersmorelikelysen- sitized to prejudice, were inﬂuential in shaping research on racial prejudice, discrimination, and stereotypes and the con- sequential move away from American psychology’s biologi- callybasednotionofracedifference.InthecaseofKurtLewin, heraldedbymanyasthemostimportantsocialpsychologistof thecentury,hisownexperiences,coupledwiththeinﬂuenceof Europeansocialism,shapedhisstudiesoflaborconditionsthat considered foremost the perspective of the workers and at- tended to the broader context in which events, including labor, transpire (van Elteren, 1993). The inﬂuence of émigré social psychologists is evident in the scientiﬁc investigations of the psychologyoffascismandanti-Semitism;mostnotableofthis socially responsive work is the authoritarian personality the- ory (Samelson, 1985), discussed more in a later section.

Some streams of intellectual activity, to extend Samelson’s metaphor of the ﬁeld’s watercourse, eventually evaporate or are dammed. Despite economic scarcity or perhaps because of it, the 1930s proved a fertile period of innovations, al- though most of these noncanonical ideas did not survive long. Katherine Pandora (1997) has recovered and documented one such innovative gesture in the interwar work of Garner Murphy, Lois Barclay Murphy, and Gordon Allport through which they “rejected the image of the laboratory as an ivory tower, contested the canons of objectivity that characterized current research practice, and argued against reducing nature and the social worlds to the lowest possible terms” (1997, p. 3). They also questioned the prevailing conceptions of democracy and the moral implications of social scientiﬁc experts’ interest in adjusting individuals to their social envi- ronment. These psychologists’differences with the status quo were sharp, as witnessed by Gordon Allport’s claim that “To a large degree our division of labor is forced, not free; young people leaving our schools for a career of unemployment be- come victims of arrested emotional intellectual development; our civil liberties fall short of our expressed ideal. Only the extension of democracy to those ﬁelds where democracy is not at present fully practiced—to industry, education and administration, and to race relations for examples—can make possible the realization of inﬁnitely varied purposes and the exercise of inﬁnitely varied talents” (Allport, quoted in Pandora, 1997, p. 1). His stance on the relation of the individ- ual to society, and on the state of society, stands in stark contrast to the elitist models of social control, personal ad- justment, and democratic social engineering that inhered in
