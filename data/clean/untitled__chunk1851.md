# Brain Surgery

In 1890, Swiss psychiatrist G. Burkhardt, assuming that the causes of speciﬁc kinds of abnormal behavior were located in particular parts of the brain, removed parts of the cortex in patients with hallucinations and other symptoms, hoping to eliminate symptoms. He claimed that the treatment improved patients, but he came under criticism from his colleagues and abandoned the technique (Goldstein, 1950). Others per- formed surgery on mental patients, including an Estonian neurosurgeon who, in 1900, cut the connections between the frontal and parietal lobes, but with no detectable improve- ment in patient condition (Valenstein, 1986).

Not until the 1930s did brain surgery occur to any signiﬁ- cant extent. In 1935, two Portuguese physicians, Egas Moniz and Almeida Lima, performed an operation using a procedure that came to be known as prefrontal lobotomy (Moniz, 1937). Walter Freeman and James Watts (1948) later modiﬁed the method in the United States. By 1950, more than 5,000 lobotomies had been performed in the United States. An esti- mated tens of thousands of such operations were performed worldwide between 1948 and 1952. The surgery was per- formed initially on patients with chronic schizophrenia, but was later extended to patients with other psychiatric disor- ders, as well as to criminals (Valenstein, 1986) and to hyper- active children (Masson, 1986). In the course of time other related forms of brain surgery such as transorbital lobotomy, and cingulotomy were developed.

These procedures, collectively referred to as “psy- chosurgery,” became the focus of scientiﬁc and ethical controversy. Ethical concerns centered on the irreversible damage done to the psychological functioning of the patient and extended as far as the actual circumstances under which the operations were performed, sometimes in the physician’s ofﬁce on an outpatient basis, often by physicians who were not qualiﬁed neurosurgeons. On one occasion Freeman administered a transorbital lobotomy in a motel room, ﬁrst anesthetizing the patient by administering electroconvul- sive treatment (ECT) to produce coma (Valenstein, 1986). Freeman ultimately lost his surgical privileges at a California hospital following the death of a patient during surgery. By that time, psychosurgery was already in decline, partly be- cause of the extreme ethical questions raised, and partly because emerging new medications provided safer, more ef- fective and humane alternatives.
