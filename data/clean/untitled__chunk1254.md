In spite of his maturationalist leanings, Gesell, too, was a proliﬁc and inﬂuential voice in the “advice to parents” move- ment. Over a period of 40 years, Gesell and his colleagues (Gesell & Ilg, 1946; Gesell, Ilg, & Ames, 1956) offered not only normative guidelines to help parents anticipate the developmental trajectories of their children but also speciﬁc advice concerning child-rearing tactics, toys, and tomes for children of different ages (see Clarke-Stewart, 1978, 1998). The outreach efforts of both Watson and Gesell were consis- tent with the tenor of the time and theAmerican belief that the new developmental science could and should be harnessed to improve the lives of children.
