# Less commitment

Theoption for adoptingthe intention of turnover as a variable inthisresearch is due to the fact that it represents a potential wish of leaving of actual employees of researched enterprise. A literary review reveals that the most of variables, which affect the intention of turnover, may be grouped in demographics, job satisfaction and organizational commitment (Du et al., 2006). Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze the intention of leaving the organization, as well as to relate this intention in organizational commitment and job satisfaction perspective of employees. In the next sections, these subjects will be reviewed in detail.

2.2 Organizational commitment Mowday (1984) defended that a high level of commitment of employees may be one of the ways to minimize the consequences of the turnover. For this reason and for this construct to be considered as one of the causesof theturnover, thissubject waschosen for this study to analyze the commitment of the employee with the organization. By definition, Siqueira and Gomide JÃºnior (2004) understood that the organizational commitment is a relation at a psychological state maintained between an employee and organization. To Baotham et al. (2010), it is the degree of loyalty and support that the employees show to the organization, having, according to Robbins (2005), a positive correlation between the commitment and the will to remain in the organization.

The study about the commitment concept is largely diversified due to multiple objectives that may be the aim of this bond (Bastos, 1993). In Brazil, the research that investigates exclusively the organization focus is predominant (Medeiros et al., 2002). About the state of art of research in Brazil, it is highlighted in the study of Medeiros et al. (2003) who, analyzing the agenda of research, pointed the relevance of the theme, the focus of research and the gaps. In the meta-analysis of Jaros et al. (1993), the authors stand out against the controversies which exist among the concepts of organizational commitment regarding its attitudinal or behavioral nature. In the attitudinal vision, there is a consensus that it is a multidimensional construct, though the research works are still not conclusive. According to Bastos et al. (2008), the other strand highlights the necessity of investigating the commitment since behavioral indicators or processes bond the individual to a specific course of action. The behavioral commitment label searches emphasize the effect of the commitment of the past over further choices. In this study, the attitudinal perspective was used.
