# Discrete Context

Team Task The nature of a team’s task can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the extent to which team members are interdependent in terms of goals and task outcomes and on the utilization of cognitive resources represented by team members; team task is therefore an important consideration in theoretical models of team effectiveness (see Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, & Jundt, 2005; LePine, Hanson, Borman, & Motowidlo, 2000). Not surprisingly, several researchers have argued that task characteristics such as the nature of task complexity and task interdependence can inﬂuence the manner in which diversity shapes team processes and outcomes.

team outcome interdependence ‘‘buffers’’ the negative effects of diversity on team process outcomes. The authors propose that outcome interdependence reinforces common group goals that can counteract the negative effects of diversity, such that highly outcome interdependent teams with high levels of diversity would show more positive outcomes (i.e., team reﬂexivity) than highly diverse teams with low outcome interdependence. Highly outcome inter- dependent teams with low levels of diversity would be less reﬂexive than highly diverse teams with low outcome interdependence. Findings suggested that for the overall diversity measure, gender diversity and tenure diversity, high levels of diversity and outcome interdependence predicted higher levels of reﬂexivity than the other three conditions.

For example, Schippers et al.

(2003) argued that

Researchers have also considered other aspects of team task such as task complexity and routineness as moderators of the relationship between
