# Practice active listening.

One of the places where many people lose focus is during conversations,

notes Montminy. This occurs in team meetings on Zoom (you really

think no one notices when you check your email in another tab?)

and can happen even in person when you’re talking with a colleague

one minute, and the next, you’re mentally elsewhere, distracted

by your phone. “We’ve become accustomed to not being present

with each other,” she says. “Shallow interactions have become the

norm.” To improve your focus and rebuild connection, Montminy

recommends making a deliberate eﬀort to practice active listening. This

involves maintaining eye contact, tuning into what the other person

is saying, and asking thoughtful questions. By doing so, you not only

sharpen your concentration but also deepen your connections. “Make

intentional changes to prioritize your relationships,” she advises.
