# Tune into your energy patterns.

Your attention at work has a rhythm, says Mark. Your peak focus times

are aﬀected by your chronotype, or your natural circadian rhythm.

Mark’s research ﬁnds that most people have peak focus times around

11 AM and mid-afternoon, though this varies depending on whether

you’re an early bird or night owl. To discover your personal rhythm,

keep a diary tracking your energy and concentration levels throughout

the day. “The desire to scroll or check your socials is a sign of your focus

starting to quiver, usually toward the end of one of your cycles,” says

Montminy. Then, schedule demanding tasks during your peak cognitive

hours and reserve less-complex work, like email, for when your energy

dips. “Understanding and adapting to your energy ﬂuctuations helps

you align your work schedule with your personal rhythm,” she says.
