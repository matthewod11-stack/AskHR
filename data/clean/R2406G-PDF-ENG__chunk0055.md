## retirement plans, personal ﬁnancial activity, and healthcare beneﬁts.

Voya examined how people make ﬁnancial decisions and discovered

numerous opportunities to be a better partner. If it could get a

more complete picture of customer ﬁnancials, executives realized, it

could dramatically improve its ability to inform customers about their

situations and recommend options.

Voya’s leaders started by recognizing that most people don’t really

understand how their disparate ﬁnancial relationships ﬁt together.

Their research showed that few people had thought through how their

healthcare costs were likely to aﬀect their ﬁnancial plans, or why their

retirement and personal savings should have diﬀerent goals and get

diﬀerent tax treatment. So they ﬁrst focused on bringing together all the

data, educating their members, and providing a single app, My Voyage,

where members could see and add to their ﬁnancial proﬁles.

The top quartile of firms in the Personalization Index outperformed not only the laggards but also the market index over three, five, and 10 years.
