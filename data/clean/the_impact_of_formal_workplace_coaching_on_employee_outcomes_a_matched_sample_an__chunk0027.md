# Propensity score matching

When comparing two groups, where one receives treatment (e.g. formal workplace coaching) and the other does not, it is ideal when both groups are equivalent on characteristics other than the treatment. This ensures any between-group difference can be attributed solely to the treatment effect (Hammack-Brown et al., 2024). To strengthen confidence that the difference between our coached and no-coach groups resulted from coaching status alone we applied propensity score matching (PSM), an advanced statistical technique that reduces the risk of selection bias in non-random samples. PSM is used in other fields including medicine and education. For example, Wang et al. (2021) used PSM to compare hospital patients with severe COVID-19 on clinical improvement rates, finding no difference between the treatment group (treated with traditional Chinese medicine and normal care) and the control group (normal care only). Similarly, Melguizo et al. (2011) applied PSM when estimating differences in higher education outcomes, showing that the treatment group (community college path students) experienced lower educational achievement compared with the control group (4-year college path students).
