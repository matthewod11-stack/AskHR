# you.

Ask yourself: Who has your back? Who really gets you, not just the

reﬁned and packaged you, but the straining, striving, and vulnerable

version of you that’s trying to ﬁgure out life as you go? Who has ﬁdelity

to the truth? Who can you count on to be honest with you? Who has

lived a life that you respect?
