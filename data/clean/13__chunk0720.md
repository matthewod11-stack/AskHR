## Toward a Theory of Reputation in Organizations

Markus and Zajonc (1985) suggested that individuals tend to draw attention from others the extent to which they possess features, or demo- nstrate behavior, that sets them apart from others. Furthermore, Taylor and Fiske (1978) concluded that when individuals distinguish themselves by attracting attention, they tend to be rated more extremely, are better reme- mbered by others, and are more likely to have their focal behavior attributed dispositionally, so as to allocate causal responsibility to themselves.

Time (Repeated Nature of Behavior) Although many scholars most likely would agree that a reputation may be lost or greatly diminished with one wrong move (e.g., Nixon and Watergate, Exxon and the Valdez, Firestone and the Ford Explorer), most have proposed that reputation must be proactively maintained over time (i.e., Ferris et al., 2003; Biddle & Thomas, 1966). Indeed, the very nature of reputation suggests that it is a time-dependent phenomenon, whereby it does not occur based on a single demonstration of a behavioral deviation from the norm. A single deviation from the norm, if radical enough, may launch an individual into celebrity status (e.g., Monika Lewinski), but by established deﬁnition, this does not create a reputation, because the deviation from the norms is not consistently repeated (Kreps & Wilson, 1982; Ferris et al., 2003).

Although an individual may become ‘‘known for an action,’’ this would manifest itself in the form of fame or notoriety (Johnson, 2004), but because the information that is provided offers no predictive qualities (Scherer, 1980), it would not greatly aid in reputation building. We view reputation as becoming a solidiﬁed and stable shared perception by an audience only as the focal behavior is repeated over time, thus leading others to expect certain behaviors and actions from the focal individual.

In recent years, systematic attention has been drawn to the issue of time in the organizational sciences, suggesting that time be incorporated in meaningful ways to enrich theory and research (e.g., George & Jones, 2000). Phenomena like socialization and career progress, in addition to reputation, have a temporal component that is critical to an informed understanding of these constructs.

Reputation Ferris et al. (2003) suggested a ‘‘capital as metaphor’’ perspective on reputation, which borrows from Fombrun’s (1996) notion of ‘‘reputational capital’’ (i.e., as it applies to corporate reputations), and highlights the common notion that reputation has value. Ferris et al. argued that the

source of a reputation’s value lies in how it allows others to use individuals’ reputations to predict their future behavior. Tyler and Kramer (1996) suggested that the value of reputational effects stem from the degree of trust elicited in social interactions. From this social network perspective, indirect or third-party ties are a source of information that serves to enhance the trust one places in another.

This triangulation effect on an individual’s reputation serves to increase the reputation’s value among multiple constituents, and consequently, the reputational costs of non-cooperative behavior as well (Gulati & Westphal, 1999). Similarly, Tyler and Kramer (1996) noted this effect when they suggested that social institutions sanction those who violate trust, and that by making untrustworthy behavior costly, these social institutions assert both formal and informal control. This market conceptualization implies that the prediction of future behavior is a form of information that has value commensurate with its accuracy.

Klein (1997) argued that reputation is a proxy for trust, and he contended that take place under conditions of uncertainty. Furthermore, he argued that this uncertainty extends to the contextual details of the myriad of interactions in our daily lives, and in an effort to reduce uncertainty, individuals look for seals of approval on others, and covet those same seals for themselves. Complicating these interactions is the notion that an individual’s reputation is constantly being redeﬁned beyond the level of the dyadic exchange.
