Attributions for the Causes of Behavior Attribution theory is based on the assumption that individuals have an inherent need to explain the causes of events that surround them (Heider, 1958). So, this part of the model indicates that the relationship between the audience assessment of the behavioral deviation from norms and the conferring of reputation on the actor by the audience is moderated by the cause to which the behavior is attributed. Certainly, this relationship should be stronger the extent to which the audience makes a personal or dispositional (i.e., internal) attribution for the behavior, as opposed to a situational (i.e., external) one. The ascription of a dispositional attribution allocates causal responsibility for the behavior to the person, so that it cannot be explained away as a function of contextual forces, which would deprive the actor of such responsibility.
