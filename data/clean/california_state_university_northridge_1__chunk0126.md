This act recognizes a practice called constructive discharge "and

situations whereby employers can make continued employment intolerable to the

employee" (Aalberts et al., 1993). Theses actions can mean termination however, just like

other forms of termination, it can become a violation when good cause is not present. The

p. 39). META can be interpreted as a concept with good intention, but no state

recognizes the goals and objectives it was designed to achieve.

employer and filing worker compensation claim. In the area of technology, e-mail is

company property and can be used against an employee who is sending messages to

threatening, or sexually harassing another employee. At the same time, it can be a

disadvantage to agents of the employer who communicate to one another how an

employee was terminated, if the reason is a violation of the law.

Also, there are other protections in the law for employees, such as ADEA and

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, to name a few. This study shows, employees who are 40

years of age or older, cannot be terminated from their job on the sole base of their age. In

addition, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act affords employees protection on several issues.

An employer cannot use reduction in the workforce as pretext for age discrimination; this

would be disparate treatment. The laws and public policy are designed to afford rights to
