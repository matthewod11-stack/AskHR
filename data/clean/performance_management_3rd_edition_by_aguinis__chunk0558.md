## Chapter 3 • Performance Management and Strategic Planning

future, analyzing the environment, providing focus, creating a culture of cooperation, generating new options, and serving as a guide for the daily activities of all organizational members. • Performance management systems must rely on the strategic plan to be useful. The behaviors, results, and developmental plans of all employees must be aligned with the vision, mission, goals, and strategies of the organization and unit. • The process of creating a strategic plan begins with an environmental analysis, which considers internal (e.g., organiza- tional structure, processes) as well as external (e.g., economic, technological) trends. Internal trends can be classified as either strengths or weaknesses, and external trends can be classified as either opportunities or threats. A gap analysis consists of pairing strengths and weaknesses with opportunities and threats and determining whether the situation is advantageous (i.e., lever- age), disadvantageous (i.e., problem), or somewhere in between (i.e., constraint and vulnerability).

- The second step in creating a strategic plan is to write a mission statement based on the results of the gap analysis. A mission statement defines why the organization exists, the scope of its activities, the customers served, and the products and services offered. Mission statements also include information about what technology is used in production or delivery, and the unique benefits or advantages of the organiza- tion’s products and services. Finally, a mission statement can include a state- ment of values and beliefs, such as the organization’s managerial philosophy. • The third component of a strategic plan is the vision statement, which includes a description of future aspirations. Whereas the mission statement empha- sizes the present, the vision statement

emphasizes the future. In many cases, however, the mission and vision state- ments are combined into one statement. For vision statements to be most useful they must be brief, verifiable, bound by a timeline, current, focused, under- standable, inspiring, and a stretch. the mission

- After

and vision statements are created, the next step in the strategic planning process is to generate specific goals that will help fulfill the mission and vision. Goals provide more specific information re- garding how the mission and vision will be implemented. Typically, goals span a five-year period.

- The final step in the strategic planning process is to identify strategies that will help achieve the stated goals. These strategies are game plans and usually address issues surrounding growth, sur- vival, turnaround, stability, innovation, and leadership. The HR department plays an important role in identifying strategies because its members have knowledge of the organization’s mission and vision as well as the organization’s internal capabilities, or what is called an organization’s human capital.

- The organization’s strategic plan, includ- ing the mission, vision, goals, and strate- gies, cascades down to all organizational levels. Thus, each division or unit also creates its own strategic plan, which should be consistent with the organiza- tion’s overall plan. The most effective sequence for doing so is for the units to first agree on common strategies and then specify unit-level goals.

- The tasks and KSAs included in indi- vidual job descriptions must be congru- ent with the organization’s and unit’s strategic plans. In other words, job descriptions should include activities that, if executed well, will in turn help execute the mission and vision. Job descriptions that are detached from
