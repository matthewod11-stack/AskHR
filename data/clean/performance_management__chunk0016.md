# Subordinates

Anonymous feedback from subordinates, often called upward feedback, can lead to positive changes in the behavior of super- visors. Leaders who receive feedback from subordinates that is more negative than their self-evaluation show the greatest level of subsequent improvement. These positive behavior changes have been shown to be sustainable over time. This is especially true for managers who have high self-efﬁcacy, namely, ‘‘I can change.’’ that Upward appraisals are used in such compa- nies as Pratt and Whitney and AT&T.
