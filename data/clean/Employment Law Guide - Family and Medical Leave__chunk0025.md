# Who is Covered

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is administered by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The FMLA provides a means for employees to balance their work and family responsibilities by taking unpaid, job-

protected leave for certain reasons. The Act is intended to promote the stability and economic security of

families as well as the nation's interest in preserving the integrity of families.

The FMLA applies to any employer in the private sector who engages in commerce, or in any industry or activity

aﬀecting commerce, and who has 50 or more employees each working day during at least 20 calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.

The law also covers all public agencies (state and local governments) and local education agencies (schools,

whether public or private). These employers do not need to meet the "50-employee" test. Title II of FMLA

covers most Federal employees, who are subject to regulations(http://www.opm.gov/oca/leave/HTML/fmlafac2.asp)

issued by the Oﬃce of Personnel Management.

To be eligible for FMLA leave, an individual must meet the following criteria:

Be employed by a covered employer and work at a worksite within 75 miles of which that employer employs
