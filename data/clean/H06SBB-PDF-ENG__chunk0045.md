# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

going to just see a whole lot of variety, and we’re going to talk a lot more

about the rituals that we create in order to bring us together.

ADI IGNATIUS: Before we let you go, I’ve asked a lot of our guests more

about innovation, and I guess my question is, tell us something about

innovation that we don’t already know.

SANDY SPEICHER: I think innovation often gets synthesized pretty

quickly to be this kind of always-playful, happens-really-fast, happens-

in-the-spark-of-the-moment, process. And it’s true that there are times

in an innovation journey that you come together that way, but you

do that in order to really do the rigorous work of understanding the

implications of what you’re imagining, of processing what you’ve really

been hearing, understanding what that turns into. So I guess the thing I

would say that most people aren’t talking about with innovation is that

it’s actually a really rigorous process.

ADI IGNATIUS: That’s great. So Sandy, I want to thank you for being

with us. My producer sent me a note that we’ve probably had more

audience questions for this show than we’ve had at any other. So people

are really very interested in you and very interested in the topic. So

thank you very much for being on The New World of Work.

SANDY SPEICHER: Oh, thank you. Thanks Adi. I really enjoyed

chatting with you.
