## general statistical information in favor of speciﬁc case information

or anecdotes, and conﬁrmation bias, the propensity to seek out and

overweight results that support your existing beliefs—also hinder the

systematic weighing of evidence. But companies don’t have to fall

into this pattern. Drawing on our research, work with companies,

and teaching experience (including executive education classes in

leadership and business analytics and a recent MBA course called Data-

Driven Leadership), we have developed an approach general managers

can apply to discussions of data so that they can make better decisions.
