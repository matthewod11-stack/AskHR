# term career trajectory.”

Explore non-monetary means of motivation. During tough times, your

role is not only to motivate and inspire your team members, but also

to keep them from becoming demoralized about the lack of raises and

promotions on the table. It’s disheartening when their year of hard work

and accomplishments are overshadowed by the business’s struggles.

“You might be thinking, ‘How do I keep people motivated when they’re

not going to get a bonus?’” says Sedatole. Thankfully, research is on

your side. “There are lots of ways to make people happy in their roles

by improving other aspects of their jobs,” she says. Studies suggest that

giving employees autonomy, growth experiences, and meaningful work

can be powerful motivational tools. During reviews, Sedatole suggests

asking your employees what would increase their job satisfaction. Some

might be interested in mentorship opportunities and cross-company

projects that oﬀer exposure to new disciplines and colleagues. Others

might care most about ﬂexible work hours and locations.

Pay special attention to your stars. Listen carefully to answers from

your star employees, says Mondal. “Your high potentials and top

performers are especially in need of inspiration,” she says. “They are

motivated by a steep learning curve. When they get bored, their curve

ﬂattens so you need to get creative and keep it at a steep angle.”
