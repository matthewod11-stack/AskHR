labor contracts, especially with sorting among high-ability and low-ability workers.

Their argument is strengthened (and more robust) if we introduce heterogeneity

in self-confidence among workers. If some workers are overly convinced of their

own abilities (and their overconfidence is not negatively correlated with ability),

tournaments become a particularly cheap form of compensation. Overconfident

individuals will overestimate the expected value of entering the tournament outcome

and will be willing to accept lower current compensation.

Option-based compensation and rank-order based promotion are two examples

of how firms can reduce their compensation costs at the expense of employees who

are too optimistic about the firm’s prospects. These examples assume implicitly that

the organization itself—or the top management teams of an organization—is not

affected by biases observed in individuals further down the hierarchy or outside the

organization, but may remedy or even exploit them.
