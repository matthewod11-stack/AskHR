# time.

- Other people judged wrong. Shame goes in this bucket if you realize

that other people wrongly criticized you for an appropriate action. Fﬃrm yourself for doing what was right, reminding yourself that

leaders walk independent from the crowd.

By proactively reviewing these moments, you’ll reduce the likelihood

that they’ll resurface during your next leadership challenge. You’ll also

gain strength from shame, turning it from hindrance into sustenance.

Key Takeaway: The brain believes its memories of success because it

has lived them, so by strengthening those memories in advance, you

equip yourself with the emotional conﬁdence to overcome Flashback
