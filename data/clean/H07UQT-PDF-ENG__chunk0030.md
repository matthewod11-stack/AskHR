## setup for the third phase of CEO onboarding: observe.

During the observe month, the new CEOâ€™s daily programming remains

similar to the previous month, with a steady diet of meetings and site

visits. But the new CEO should now be gradually transitioning beyond

listen-only to a more active role. During this stage, the incoming CEO

should be free and encouraged to voice his opinions and observations

both in private and in group meetings. During this phase, however,

the outgoing CEO is still in charge, and decisions are still made by

them. This is a good time for both the outgoing CEO and incoming

CEO to create a good rapport and for the incoming CEO to get a better

understanding of the how and whys behind the decision making in the
