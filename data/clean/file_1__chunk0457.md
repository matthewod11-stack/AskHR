# Individual factors

Pay expectations: pay expectations can have an impact on the way individuals perceive the gender pay gap because individuals' perceptions of financial rewards of others are affected by the perceptions of whether their own opportunities are equal to the opportunities of others. Pay expectations, or as economists call them â€“ reservation wage, are determined by individual wealth, labour market opportunities, opportunity costs of work performed at home, length of employment, age, skill level, and other factors. Furthermore, according to social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954), pay expectations are determined by social comparison information. Individuals make comparisons among themselves, others, and the idealized images. Several models have been introduced based on social comparison theory. One of them is the triadic model, which proposes that individuals with similar attributes and opinions are influential to each other (Suls, Martin and Wheeler, 2002). This may mean that those individuals who have low expectations tend to compare themselves with those individuals who have similar expectations.

Individuals with low pay expectations may believe that less pay is a reasonable pay not only for themselves but also for others (Jackson and Grabski, 1988). In this case, individuals with low pay expectations are suggested to build their pay expectations for others based on the knowledge of other individuals with similar pay. Individuals with low pay expectations might be less likely to be surprised and to consider somebody's salary to be unreasonable when they learn about this person's salary. Accordingly, individuals with low expectations are expected to perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than individuals with high pay expectations. Thus, the following proposition is formulated:

Proposition 1: individuals with lower pay expectations will perceive the gender pay gap to a lesser extent than individuals with higher pay expectations.

Gender role orientation: gender role orientation may determine whether and to what extent individuals perceive the gender pay gap to exist. Gender role orientation is defined as the beliefs that individuals hold about the proper roles for men and women at work and at home (Judge and Livingston, 2008). Gender role orientation can be either traditional or egalitarian. Traditional conception of gender role orientation suggests that men specialize in the market work and build their careers with support from families, who provide them with confidence, while women primarily care about family and think about their careers only
