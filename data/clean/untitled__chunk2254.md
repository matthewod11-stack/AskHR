## FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY

While we focused our attention on three areas above, the full range of topics that now fall under the rubric of forensic psychology is impressively broad. To illustrate, the second edition of The Handbook of Forensic Psychology (Hess & Weiner, 1999) contains sections on applying psychology to civil proceedings, applying psychology to criminal proceed- ings, communicating expert opinions, intervening with of- fenders, and professional issues (legal, ethical, and moral considerations; training in forensic psychology and the law). Among the civil proceedings discussed are mediating domes- tic law issues, personality assessment, educational disabili- ties, and civil competency. Among the criminal proceedings covered are assessing dangerousness and risk; evaluating eyewitness testimony; assessing jury competence; recom- mending probation and parole; assessing competency to stand trial, diminished capacity, and criminal responsibility; interacting with law enforcement; the “state of the art” of polygraph testing; and forensic uses of hypnosis. The section on interventions includes discussions of punishment, diver- sion, and alternative routes to crime prevention, substance abuse programs, psychotherapy with criminal offenders, and diagnosing and treating sexual offenders.

Research is currently being carried out within each of these areas, and the results are reported regularly in the foren- sically oriented journals mentioned earlier, as well as in mainstream psychology journals and, less frequently, in law reviews and other legal journals. In addition, many psycholo- gists now take an active role in attempting to apply research ﬁndings and other relevant psychological knowledge to the legal system. In addition to the wide range of situations involving clinical psychological evaluations, these efforts may include writing research-based articles designed to in- form both attorneys and social scientists, delivering expert testimony, creating science-translation briefs, consulting with attorneys, and making presentations as part of continuing- education programs for attorneys and judges.

The future of forensic psychology looks bright, as com- munication between leaders in both ﬁelds appears to be

increasing in frequency and understanding. The potential for mutually beneﬁcial cooperation between psychology and the legal system seems more promising than at any time since the optimistic (though inaccurate) predictions made by Freud and Münsterberg almost a century ago.
