level, perpetrators understand what’s wrong, but they have rationalizations for why it doesn’t apply to them.

Then what kind of training can help? There isn’t a simple solution. Basic awareness training—making sure people understand what the laws are, what their rights are, and how to access resources if they need them—is important, but it doesn’t necessarily change perpetrators’ behavior. We also have to teach speciﬁc skills. Create scenarios tailored to the audience— situations that will resonate. If people are comfortable, try role-playing. Talk to people about how they’d handle a given situation—why one person would respond one way and someone else another way— and discuss the best responses. That kind of training, including bystander intervention training, gives people tangible skills to practice, and those skills become an automatic reﬂex.

Is sexual harassment a bigger problem in the military than in the private sector? Research shows that two signiﬁcant risk factors for sexual harassment are male-dominated organizations and hierarchical ones. Both descriptions apply to the military. But sexual harassment is endemic; it occurs in every industry around the world.

Are you seeing a backlash as sexual harassment gets more attention? According to anecdotes and survey data, some men in the Canadian

Armed Forces feel guilt by association—that there’s a pervasive message that all men are potential perpetrators. We’ve heard from male senior ofﬁcers who are uncomfortable meeting one-on-one with female subordinates. Women in some units report being excluded from certain social events. The reports are unfortunate but not surprising. People are trying to

ﬁgure out how they ﬁt in, how to respond to these issues, and how to stay safe.

Is the prevention work making a difference? Statistics Canada, an independent national ofﬁce, surveyed sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces in 2016 and 2018. Unfortunately, the rate of self-reported sexual assaults did not drop in that

time, consistent with national trends that have stayed steady for 20 years. But there are positive ﬁndings, including a 10% decrease in people who have witnessed or experienced sexualized or hostile behavior. There were reductions in the 15 other types of negative behavior measured. We attri bute that to the training the Canadian Armed Forces has put in place.
