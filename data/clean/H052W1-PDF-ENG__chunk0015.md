# Set expectations with colleagues

Be mindful of how you manage relationships with colleagues as you

settle into your new work life. A lot of parents return from leave with

the “mindset of ‘I’ll ﬁgure it out’ or ‘I’ll adapt,’” but this is risky, Dowling

says. “If you don’t go in with a clear idea of what your schedule and

plans are, others will make assumptions.” Communication is critical.

Be direct about how and when you will work. Make your schedule

predictable. For instance, “if you need to leave every night at 5 PM on

the dot, then people will know not to come by your oﬃce at 4:59 PM

wanting to talk,” she says. Things may change over time and even on the

ﬂy, of course, but if you “train your colleagues on what to expect” — and

explain your schedule requirements clearly — they will learn how and

when to adjust as needed.
