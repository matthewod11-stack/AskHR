# Engage with Sparring Partners

Integrating a novel idea into a corporation’s existing production and

marketing operations and getting it through legal and ﬁnancial reviews

almost always leads to conﬂicts. What makes an idea unique may also

make it disrupt the smooth operation of the mainstream business. It

may be a new technology play that doesn’t ﬁt with the current model.

Perhaps it’s a service when the company sells only products. Or it might

make a technological platform the company is invested in obsolete.
