Leaving aside crowding out, monetary incentives could also affect performance

negatively if high incentives create arousal that inhibits automatic responses or cre-

ates distraction (e.g., “choking under pressure”). According to the “Yerkes—Dodson

Law” (Yerkes and Dodson 1908), arousal increases performance up to a point at

which further arousal degrades performance. Ariely et al. (2003) demonstrate this

effect with experiments conducted in India. They allowed their subjects to earn up to six months of wages® in various simple games. Surprisingly, the subjects with

the highest payment perform worse than those with the moderate and the low pay-

ment in almost all games. It is, of course, unclear how relevant this effect is for the

economics of organizations, given actual wage-setting and reward policies. Even if

the effect were prevalent, wage-setters may account for it and adjust wages appro-

priately. Moreover, if experience with high-stakes situations decreases arousal, the

effect may only apply to inexperienced agents.
