Figure 5.2d Employee’s consent to release information

I, , authorize the Bundy Shoe Company to contact any or all of my former employers or any or all of the references I have supplied to Bundy Shoe Company for the purpose of verifying any of the information I have provided to Bundy Shoe Company and/or for the purpose of obtaining any information whatsoever, whether favorable or unfavorable, about me or my employment with any former employer.

A number of years ago, on the basis of several letters of recommendation, our department hired a part-time instructor. Two weeks after he started the job, we discovered that he had to return to his home in another state to face charges of stealing drugs from his former employer, a psychology department at another university. We were upset because neither of the references from his former job mentioned the charges. After a rather heated conversation with one of the references, we learned that the applicant was the son of the department chairman and that the faculty were afraid to say anything that would anger their boss.

These last examples show why providing references and letters of recommen- dations can be so difficult. On the one hand, a former employer can be charged with slander or libel if it says something bad about an applicant that cannot be proven. On the other hand, an employer can be held liable if it does not provide information about a potentially dangerous applicant. Because of these compet- ing responsibilities, many organizations will confirm only employment dates and salary information unless a former employee has been convicted of a criminal offense that resulted in termination. The use of professional reference-checking companies can help alleviate this problem.

I, , am applying for a position with the Bundy Shoe Company and authorize any of my former employers to provide a representative of Bundy Shoe Company with any and all information pertaining to my previous employment and/or other related behavior. I agree to waive any future defamation or other legal claims arising from information provided to the Bundy Shoe Company.
