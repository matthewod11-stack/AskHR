## myopic view of the world through one’s own function or region.

This creates four core problems:

Fragmented governance

Each 1:1 functions like a mini steering committee, but with no one else

in the room. Governance becomes informal and duplicative, requiring

rework and follow-up meetings just to keep others up to speed. Worse,

viewpoints that weren’t considered in the initial 1:1 then surface later

on, leading to friction that could have been avoided. When too much

time is spent in fragmented meetings, there’s little left for the work that

only senior leaders can do: stewarding enterprise priorities, developing

talent, and advancing culture.
