# Management Decision 36/ 8 [1998] 543–548

[ 546 ]

“good” change. The legislative process, for example, is predicated upon resistance play- ing a crucial role in ensuring the best possi- ble laws are produced. Resistance, in the for m of rivalry between (at least) two parties, injects energy into the process and sparks debate where opinions differ. Resistance encourages greater scrutiny of legislation. It prompts the search for a variety of alter na- tives and evaluates these with greater rigour. It also means that the implementation process will be considered carefully, thereby improving the adoption of these changes by the general public.

Imagine then, a situation where new legis- lation that considerably alters an established law is enacted by parliament via a process that is marked by little resistance. It would certainly raise concer ns that the new law has not been adequately scrutinised, nor had the beneﬁt of vigorous debate. If the process of implementation is not well thought out, it may only be sparsely adopted by the general public, rendering the law ineffective.
