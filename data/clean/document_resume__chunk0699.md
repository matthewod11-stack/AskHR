# Performance Appraisal

Ilovs e" er, reputations, since they are based mostly on hearsay and random comments and ober"ations, often present inaccurate, distorted, biased pictures of employ e;:s' true abilitie!. and (I ant certain that all of us from time to time wonder ',shy our performance. super" isors are ne"er around to see us when we make a particularly brilliant decision or complete a difficult task, but always seem to appear just in time to catch us in a blunder.)43

How can an administrator make certain that a rater's observations are objeLtive and fair rather than biased and distorted? All of the suggestions in this chapter are directed toward that end, hovse"er, there are three things in partiLular that should be done to address this problem.

First, the administrator should make certain that the raters understand exactly what it is they are looking for. While they are obser" mg, they should be primed to notice specific incidents of effeLti" e or ineffeLtie beha"ior. This is why a comprehensive rater training program must Lontain information on the kinds of [tau" iors which distin- guish among levels of performance. As Christina Banks and Kos in Murphy state, "Training programs should not want appraisers merely to observe; rather they should train them novs to decide N hat to obser" e." 14 (Note that if it is unclear what beha"iors actually distinguish effeLtie from ineffeLtRe performance, a job analysis is clearly in order.45)

Second, the administrator should ascertain that all raters take a sy stematic approach to gathering the information they need to make accurate appraisals. For example, if a department head is to e" aluate the quality of each faulty member's publications on an annual basis, she should certainly hale a process in place to collect copies of all pub- lished work- -not just those papers which the faculty happen to bring to her attention. Similarly, if a committee of peers is to e"aluate a colleague's classroom teaching performance; the committee should de" isL and follov, a plan that alloys s penodiL class- room visits- -not just a single "isit that may fall on a particularly good or bad day for their colleague.

Third, the administrator should see that all raters keep some sort of orderly record of their observations. By recording these observations o'er a period of time, then refer- ring to the complete re,ord when pro" iding an appraisal, the rater can avoid being overly influenced by recent events or isolated incidents of irregular beha"ior. The next section describes some of the techniques "Nitta can be employ ed to assist raters in keeping useful records of their observations.

Many performance appraisal programs call foi ratings to be collected on a periodic basis, such as annually. It is assumed that the rater takes into Lonsideration the ratee's typical performance across the entire span of the rating period LL hen filling out the
