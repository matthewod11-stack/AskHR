# Basic Provisions/Requirements

Wage garnishment occurs when an employer is required to withhold the earnings of an individual for the

payment of a debt in accordance with a court order or other legal or equitable procedure (e.g., a debt owed by

the individual to a credit card company). Title III prohibits an employer from discharging an employee because his or her earnings have been subject to garnishment for any one debt, regardless of the number of levies

made or proceedings brought to collect it. Title III does not, however, protect an employee from discharge if

the employee's earnings have been subject to garnishment for a second or subsequent debt.

Title III also protects individuals by limiting the amount of earnings that may be garnished in any workweek or

pay period to the lesser of 25 percent of disposable earnings or the amount by which disposable earnings are greater than 30 times the Federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by Section 6(a) (1) of the Fair Labor

Standards Act of 1938. This limit applies regardless of how many garnishment orders an employer receives.

The Federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.

Title III permits a greater amount of an individual's earnings to be garnished to enforce any order for the

support of any person (e.g., spousal support or child support). Title III allows up to 50 percent of an individual's disposable earnings to be garnished for support if the individual is supporting a current spouse or

child who is not the subject of the support order, and up to 60 percent if the individual is not doing so. An

additional ﬁve percent may be garnished for support payments over 12 weeks in arrears.

An individual's "disposable earnings" is the amount of earnings left after legally required deductions (e.g.,

Federal, state and local taxes; the individual's share of Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance taxes; and contributions to state employee retirement systems required by law) have been made.

Deductions not required by law (e.g., union dues, health and life insurance premiums, and charitable

contributions) are not subtracted from earnings when the amount of disposable earnings for garnishment

purposes is calculated.

Title III's restrictions on the amount of wages that can be garnished do not apply to certain bankruptcy court orders or debts due for Federal or state taxes. Nor do they aﬀect voluntary wage assignments, i.e., situations

where workers voluntarily agree that their employers may turn over a speciﬁed amount of their earnings to a
