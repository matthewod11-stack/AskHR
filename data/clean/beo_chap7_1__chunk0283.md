# The “Deviations” Perspective

There are some important advantages to the deviations framework as a way of organizing results from behavioral economics for application to the economics of organization. First and foremost, the underlying behavioral economics literature has often used this framework, and so transfer to application in the economics of organization is most direct when it is maintained.

But additional advantages are also obtained. For example, the deviations approach

often suggests extensions of existing formal apparatus. Camerer and Malmendier

provide a nice example of this with their addition of a skill term to a more stan- dard equation for effort level in an agency model. Though it is a complication, the extension is not unmanageable, and the authors show that the term may allow theory

to accommodate a range of observed deviations from simpler representations. The

deviation approach is often able to suggest promising modification of existing for-

malisms. Indeed the whole apparatus of risk aversion, now taken for granted as

standard theory, can be viewed as embodying just such a modification.

The deviations approach likewise suggests areas of direct potential benefit to management or policy. Because people are known from field and laboratory obser-

vation to have systematic tendencies to miss potential gains, pointing out a general

pattern like hindsight bias can be directly useful to practitioners in avoiding costly

errors. Moreover, the naming conventions of the deviations approach result in quite

memorable labeling of the principles, with the implication that students can be fairly

effectively taught to watch out for problems like “the fundamental attribution error.”

And finally, the deviations approach suggests to those who study the economics of organization research questions that are likely to be productive. Camerer and Mal- mendier illustrate this advantage nicely with their account of known individual devi-

ations that may motivate organizations to develop corrective devices. For example,

they suggest that budget constraints and project milestones may be organizational

devices that function to limit individual tendencies to escalate bad commitments.

There are, of course, some costs to the deviations framework, along with the
