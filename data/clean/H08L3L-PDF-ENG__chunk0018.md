# Use an old idea.

Could an idea from the past help solve your current problem? Human

nature doesn’t change much, so something that’s fallen out of fashion

might just work again now. Find the person in your sector who has

the most experience and interview them to see if any old strategies or

techniques are worth reviving. Keep a bank of the ideas that didn’t quite

make it but could be given another try.
