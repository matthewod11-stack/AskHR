# 3.2.3 Job Descriptions

Continuing with the sequence of components shown in Figure 3.1, job descriptions also need to be congruent with the organization and unit mission, vision, goals, and strategies. We discussed the job analysis process leading to the creation of job descriptions in Chapter 2. After the strategic plan is completed, some rewriting of the existing job descriptions may be in order. Recall the job description for Trailer Truck Driver as used by the Civilian Personnel Management Service (U.S. Department of Defense) (see the accompanying box).

This description provides information about the various tasks performed together with a description of some of the KSAs required for the position. But what is the link with the organization and unit strategic plans? How do the specific tasks make a contri- bution to the strategic priorities of the transportation division and the organization as a whole? This description includes only cursory and indirect information regarding these issues. For example, one can assume that the proficient handling of bills of lading, expense accounts, and other papers pertinent to the shipment contributes toward a smooth shipping operation and, therefore, makes a contribution to the transportation division. However, this link is not sufficiently clear.

On the other hand, consider a job announcement describing the position of Performance Solutions Group Manager in Microsoft’s training and education unit (see the accompanying box).

This job description makes the link between the individual position and MSTE quite clear. First, the description includes MSTE’s mission statement so that individuals become aware of how their specific roles fit within the overall mission of the depart- ment. Second, the job description includes language to the effect that the work must lead to an “industry leading” product, which is consistent not only with MSTE’s mission but also with Microsoft’s overall mission. Third, in the needed qualifications section, there is a clear overlap between those needed for this specific position and those mentioned in MSTE’s as well as in Microsoft’s overall mission. In short, the person working as Performance Solutions Group Manager has a clear sense not only of her position but also of how behaviors and expected results are consistent with expecta- tions about MSTE and Microsoft in general.

In sum, the tasks and KSAs included in individual job descriptions must be congruent with the organization’s and unit’s strategic plans. In other words, job descriptions should include activities that, if executed well, will help execute the mission and vision. Job descriptions that are detached from strategic priorities will lead to performance evaluations focused on behaviors and results that are not central to an organization’s success.
