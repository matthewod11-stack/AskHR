# BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS OF ORGANIZATIONS

Section 7.2 moves from the individual to the organizational level. Organizing

requires informal rules for coordinating action. Following Kreps (1990), we take

the view that corporate culture is a set of shared meta-focal principles for resolv-

ing coordination problems in the face of the cognitive inability to fully specify an

employment contract. Having a sharp economic concept like this to work with could

provide a basis for useful empirical work on culture. The way the brain organizes

information (“cognitive economy”) may also explain why culture is often transmit-

ted in the form of stories, personification, and simple slogans (Heath and Seidel

2004). The value of having cultural principles that can be commonly understood,

and are immune to errors in language translation, gives a role for leadership and

managerial statements that are simple (like corporate mission statements).
