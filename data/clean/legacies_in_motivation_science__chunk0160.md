# DEVELOPMENT OF GOAL SETTING THEORY

lower expectancy (Vroom, 1964). A challeng- ing goal is less likely to be attained. Neverthe- less, a high goal leads to higher performance than one that is easily attained. The resolution to this paradox was found in Bandura’s (1997) concept of self-efﬁcacy. Self-efﬁcacy refers to task or domain self-conﬁdence and is positively related to performance. It is measured by ratings across multiple performance levels and then averaged. In contrast, expectancy is normally measured in relation to only one outcome level at a time. A single outcome expectancy rating does not predict well across participants when differ- ent individuals are assigned different goal levels relative to the more comprehensive self-efﬁcacy scale because the frame of reference is not con- stant (see Locke & Latham, 1990, Chapter 3). The self-efﬁcacy theory (Bandura, 1997) has been incorporated into goal theory and vice versa. This is because self-efﬁcacy is affected by assigned goals, inﬂuences self-set goals, af- fects responses to performance feedback, af- fects goal commitment, and is associated with the use of effective task strategies (Locke & Latham, 1990, 2002).

Supplemental results. Other issues dis- cussed in our 1990 book include the hypothesized causes of null results from goal setting, the ﬂaws in Atkinson’s deductively derived motivation the- ory, the positive effects of proximal versus distal goals on tasks that are complex for an individual, the determinants of goal choice, the role of par- ticipation in goal setting, the effects of value im- portance on affect, and the application of goal setting to human resource management.

Contingencies. A noteworthy aspect of our 1990 book is that we analyzed every goal- setting study that obtained contingent or nega- tive results. The law of contradiction asserts that something cannot be true and not true at the same time and in the same respect. Usually replication problems are caused by one of two factors: (a) the theory is wrong or at least needs further development or (b) the theory was tested inappropriately. Our analyses suggested what could be done to verify our hypotheses. So far, no one has followed up, but we believe that such an analysis serves as an antidote to the all-too-common procedure in psychology of cit- ing only results that ﬁt one’s theory while ig- noring those that do not.
