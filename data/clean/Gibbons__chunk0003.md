### **Stage 2: Designing interaction protocols**

Once you\'ve mapped capabilities, you need to design how humans and AI
will actually work together. This isn\'t about installing software and
training people to use it. It\'s about creating new collaborative
workflows that leverage the strengths you\'ve identified.

Consider the spectrum of collaboration models:

- Human-in-the-loop works for high-stakes decisions where AI generates
 > recommendations but humans retain veto power. A medical diagnosis
 > team might use this model, with AI suggesting possibilities but
 > physicians making final determinations.

- AI-in-the-loop suits creative or strategic work where humans lead
 > but consult AI for specific insights. Marketing teams developing
 > campaigns might use AI to analyze consumer data or generate
 > headline variations while maintaining creative control.

- Human-on-the-loop fits moderate-risk, high-volume operations where
 > AI handles routine cases independently while escalating
 > exceptions. Content moderation teams use this model effectively,
 > with AI managing clear policy violations while humans handle
 > nuanced cases.

The key is matching the model to the risk profile and complexity of the
work. Don\'t default to one approach for everything.
