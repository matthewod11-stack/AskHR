### **Stage 1: Mapping complementary capabilities**

The first mistake organizations make is assuming AI should replicate
human work. DeepMind succeeded because they identified what each party
did best. Humans excel at formulating research questions, understanding
context, and recognizing significance. AI excels at pattern recognition
across vast datasets, consistent application of rules, and rapid
generation of possibilities.

Start by mapping your team\'s work into three categories:

1. Human advantage zones: These include ethical reasoning, contextual
 > judgment incorporating organizational values, causal understanding
 > of why relationships exist, and creative problem-solving that
 > transcends existing patterns. A pharmaceutical research team found
 > their chemists\' understanding of synthesizability and side
 > effects couldn\'t be captured in training data. This human insight
 > proved essential for filtering AI-generated drug candidates.

2. AI advantage zones: These encompass pattern recognition across large
 > datasets, consistent application of defined criteria without
 > fatigue, rapid generation of multiple options, and processing vast
 > information volumes. The same pharmaceutical team used AI to
 > screen thousands of molecular structures in hours rather than
 > months.

3. Collaboration zones: These are areas where neither humans nor AI
 > alone are sufficient. Complex decision-making requiring both
 > pattern recognition and contextual judgment falls here. Strategic
 > planning that needs both data analysis and stakeholder
 > understanding belongs in this category.
