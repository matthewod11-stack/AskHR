Stepping into a chief executive role is exhilarating. At the same time,

the reality of leading an organization hits diﬀerently when you’re

actually in the seat. Employees, clients, board members and the media

all want to know: Who are you as a leader? What’s going to change?

What’s your strategy? Where are you taking the organization? The

temptation to act quickly is real.

In the face of those expectations, it’s important to remember that the

ﬁrst 100 days aren’t about having all the answers—they’re about setting

the foundation for long-term success. And while there may be urgent

decisions to make, you want to use this time to ask the right questions

and get clear on where you want to go and how you’ll get there.

From our experience working with hundreds of CEOs, we’ve seen four

themes emerge as top priorities for the ﬁrst 100 days. And we’ve

They also make a deliberate choice to bring in a mix of perspectives,

including both fresh voices bringing new ideas and experienced leaders

who know the ropes. And while they are fair in assessing the leadership

- Who will drive change from the trenches—coaching, empowering, and

elevating their teams, as opposed to just managing the business and

tracking metrics?

- Is my team inclusive of leaders who have diﬀerent viewpoints?

- Do I have leaders on my team who will challenge old ways of thinking

and drive towards where the business is headed?

- What signals am I sending to the organization and clients with my

# leadership choices?

# Engaging Stakeholders

Real trust and alignment doesn’t happen by accident—it needs to be

intentionally built. A key task for new CEOs is to build relationships

with stakeholders including your employees, customers, shareholders,

# board members, analysts, and community.

Leading CEOs often start with a few critical priorities and form working

groups of inﬂuential voices—those culture carriers who can shape

opinions, rally teams, build trust, and ease concerns during change. By

engaging the right voices early, the best CEOs foster al
