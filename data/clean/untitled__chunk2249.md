# Clinical Forensic Evaluations

Little research was directed toward improving clinicians’ evaluations for the courts until the 1980s. This changed dramatically across the next 20 years, heralded by seminal works published early in the 1980s. Among these were Monahan’s (1981) treatise summarizing the serious limits of our abilities to assess and predict violent behavior, the ﬁrst book to summarize what we did and did not know about competence to stand trial as a legal and forensic assessment issue (Roesch & Golding, 1980), the publication of a system- atic model for the future development of instruments to as- sess a variety of legal competencies (Grisso, 1986), and the ﬁrst comprehensive texts on the full range of forensic psy- chological evaluations for the courts in criminal, civil, and juvenile cases (Melton, Petrila, Poythress, & Slobogin, 1987; Weiner & Hess, 1987).
