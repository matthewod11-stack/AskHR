## During the transition phase, the incoming CEO’s main objective should

be to make others conﬁdent that she is well prepared to take charge.

That requires doing four things.

Learn about the audiences you must inﬂuence and about how best to

convince and persuade them. The new leader must accurately read the

hopes, fears, and goals of her new direct reports and of the executives

who still report to the incumbent CEO. That will enable her to tailor her

approach, choosing which push and pull styles are most likely to win

people over to her ideas and get them behind her objectives. Though the

CEO and the board may press her for conclusions and quick decisions,

she should take time to listen, observe, and ask questions, in hopes of

identifying which style will work best where.

Consider culture and context. The optimal inﬂuence style will depend

partly on the company’s norms and practices as well as on the technical,

ﬁnancial, and strategic forces that aﬀect its performance right now.
