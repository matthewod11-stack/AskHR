## Intelligence Is Complex: Binet’s Theory of Judgment

In 1904, the minister of Public Instruction in Paris named a commission charged with studying or creating tests that would ensure that mentally defective children (as they then were called) would receive an adequate education. The com- mission decided that no child suspected of retardation should be placed in a special class for children with mental retarda- tion without ﬁrst being given an examination “from which it could be certiﬁed that because of the state of his intelligence, he was unable to proﬁt, in an average measure, from the in- struction given in the ordinary schools” (Binet & Simon, 1916a, p. 9).

Binet and Simon devised a test based on a conception of intelligence very different from Galton’s and Cattell’s. They viewed judgment as central to intelligence. At the same time, they viewed Galton’s tests as ridiculous. They cited Helen Keller as an example of someone who was very intelligent but who would have performed terribly on Galton’s tests.

Binet and Simon’s (1916a) theory of intelligent thinking in many ways foreshadowed later research on the development of metacognition (e.g., Brown & DeLoache, 1978; Flavell & Wellman, 1977; Mazzoni & Nelson, 1998). According to Binet and Simon (1916b), intelligent thought comprises three distinct elements: direction, adaptation, and control.

Direction consists in knowing what has to be done and how it is to be accomplished. When we are required to add three numbers, for example, we give ourselves a series of in- structions on how to proceed, and these instructions form the direction of thought.

Adaptation refers to one’s selection and monitoring of one’s strategy during task performance. For example, in adding to numbers, one ﬁrst needs to decide on a strategy to add the numbers. As we add, we need to check (monitor) that we are not repeating the addition of any of the digits we al- ready have added.

Control is the ability to criticize one’s own thoughts and actions. This ability often occurs beneath the conscious level. If one notices that the sum one attains is smaller than either number (if the numbers are positive), one recognizes the need to add the numbers again, as there must have been a mistake in one’s adding.
