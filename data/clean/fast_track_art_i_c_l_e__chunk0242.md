worksite-level consumer activation interventions.43 These changes in consumer health care activation were measured using the “Patient Activation Measure.” This measure is just one example of a measure not included in any of the best practices scorecards currently avail- able. It is likely that there are many more variables that signiﬁcantly relate to improved individual-level and company-level outcomes that are not represented in current best practices guidelines. Similarly, of the variables currently represented in best practices guidelines, there is scant evidence that current deﬁnitions of successful execution of the component have the sensitivity and speciﬁcity needed for robust estimations of program success.

When EHM best practices are recommended, they are usually cast as a set of guidelines that, when taken altogether, will increase engagement and improve population-level health outcomes.19 This study’s ﬁndings suggest that best practices may need to be parsed according to the population’s demographics and risk proﬁle. The study examined the interaction between each best practices compo- nent and subsequent enrollment, ongoing participation, and behavior changeﬁndingtheinﬂuenceofbestpracticecomponentstobehighly variable, particularly when viewed in the context of their inﬂuence on age and behavior change. The ﬁnding that noncash incentives could, under some circumstances, be related to lower overall rates of enrollment, for example, is inconsistent with incentives research to date with nearly all incentives studies showing a linear relationship between the increased use of incentives and the increased program participation.27,28,44

Upon further examination, however, the ﬁndings that incen- tives are more inﬂuential with women and effectively intensify fe- male participation levels suggest not only that one size does not ﬁt all regarding which program components are featured but also re- garding whom to target with which component. Furthermore, that ﬁnancial incentives actually diminished engagement among men highlights the importance of understanding both the positive and negative effects of select program components. In an article exam- ining how ﬁnancial motivation undermines maintenance in health behavior change, Moller and colleagues also found that ﬁnancial incentives and sex interacted signiﬁcantly “such that ﬁnancial incen- tives had a more deleterious inﬂuence among men.”45

Related to this, although this study did not demonstrate a global positive effect from the use of ﬁnancial incentives related to enrollment, it did ﬁnd that companies that offered incentives for completing the HA netted higher overall behavior change rates. This relationship was even greater for the use of noncash incentives (eg, duffel bags or T-shirts) with older persons. This offers interesting insight into the kind of cascade a parsimonious use of best practices components could be designed to produce. Researchers have argued elsewhere that ﬁnancial incentives are most effective when they cat- alyze participation among those ready to change46 but may diminish outcomes for those lacking intrinsic motivation.29 Findings from this studysuggestthattheuseofincentivestoinﬂuencethepathwayfrom initial assessment to successful behavior change outcomes may need to be tailored according to age as well as stage of change, and once an individual is actively participating in a program, risk reductions can be enhanced with minor incentives.

The inﬂuence of biometric screening is a best practices com- ponent where the face validity of this study’s ﬁnding is high and where targeted use of the component is apparent. This study also found that biometric screenings intensiﬁed the positive relationship between higher program participation among older employees. That older employees will beneﬁt more from the teachable moments that a screening can offer could be viewed from the obvious vantage point that older employees are more likely to have clinical metrics outside of recommended standards.47 Nevertheless, younger employees are also routinely found to be outside of recommended ranges so the absence of a similar positive effect on participation for the younger employees suggests that screening is a best practice for increasing

participation in older workforces but other approaches to driving engagement are more effective in younger workforces.

Conducting more extensive program evaluation is a best prac- tices program component that is related to increased participation among the younger employees in the workplace. Although the nature of this relationship is not readily apparent, and indeed this ﬁnding may simply be spurious, it may be reﬂective of the key role program evaluation plays in shaping a program relevant to the needs of the population. It could also suggest that younger employees are more sensitive to and react more strongly to the perception or reality of be- ing monitored. Using best practices speciﬁc to program evaluation involves an iterative process where process, outcome, and impact metrics are continuously reviewed both to provide an assessment of what is working and to inform changes in program design.2 In this context, companies that invest more resources into program evalua- tion may be better able to detect and ameliorate the tendency for less engagement among young employees whom we found in our global assessment of enrollment trends related to age.

For employers evaluating their programs, or researchers who may be working with a smaller number of companies, or have unique data regarding the organizational structure of branches or divisions within a single company, the results of this study suggest that they may want to consider implementing multilevel models such as hi- erarchical logistic regression or hierarchical linear modeling.48,49 Although the large number of companies included in this study would have made that approach unwieldy for this analysis, these are powerfultoolsthatallowtheanalysttocombineindividual-leveldata with organizational-level metrics to better understand the outcomes they are investigating.

As noted previously, deﬁnitions concerning what constitutes best practices in providing environmental supports needed to pro- duce the vaunted “culture of health” may lack the speciﬁcity needed to shape deﬁnitive research conclusions. Nevertheless, improving culture is an accepted best practice in spite of the dearth of re- search concerning what works in improving same.37 This study’s ﬁndings concerning the negative relationship between environmen- tal supports and program engagement seem to contradict common assumptions about the presumed favorable, even vital, interdepen- dencies of same. But here, yet again, it was the analysis underneath this global ﬁnding that may shed some insight into the differential inﬂuence of best practices. This study found that the strength of a champion network, arguably one of the most vital instruments for changing a culture,50,51 was positively related to behavior change, especially among older employees.
