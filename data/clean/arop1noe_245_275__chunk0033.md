# THINKING DIFFERENTLY ABOUT LEARNING

Traditionally, organizations have relied upon, and researchers focused on, learning that occurs through formal training and development programs. US organizations spent approximately $164.2 billion on formal training and development in 2012 (Miller 2013). Participation in these programs is often mandatory. Development may include some forms of training but typically refers to formal education, job experiences, relationships, and personality and skill assessments that help employees prepare for future jobs or positions. Increasingly, the majority of formal training and development initiatives are, and should be, strategic in the sense that they emphasize acquiringtheKSAOsnecessarytohelporganizations increasetheirabilitytodetectchange, adapt, and anticipate trends (Kraiger & Ford 2006).

However, time and workload demands, budget constraints, and a geographically dispersed workforce make it hard for organizations to offer, and employees to attend, formal programs. Even when employees do attend formal programs, it is difficult for them, owing to the demands of their roles, to bring the level of energy and attention needed to learn. One way that organi- zations are attempting to overcome the difficulties of learning in today’s workplace is through providing formal training and development programs using online delivery and instructional methods. In 2012, technology-based learning, which includes e-learning, online learning, and mobile learning, was used on average in 39% of organizations’ formal learning hours (Miller 2013).

Continuous learning, which occurs outside the realm of formal training and development, may be more important for the development of human capital resources (Sessa & London 2006). Continuous learning includes informal learning (Marsick & Watkins 1990), deliberate practice (Ericssonetal.1993),incidentallearning(Marsicketal.1999),workplacelearning(Raelin1997), andself-development(Orvis&Leffler2011).Itisestimatedthatinformallearningaccountsforup to 75% of learning within organizations (Bear et al. 2008). Informal learning includes both cognitiveactivitiesandbehaviors,includinglearningfromoneselfthroughself-reflection; learning from others such as peers, supervisors, and mentors; and learning from noninterpersonal sources,

Learning: the process of employees enhancing their human capital through acquiring knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics

Formal training and development: training and development programs, courses, and events that are developed and organized by an organization to help its employees acquire KSAOs

Continuous learning: the process of employees’ changing theirbehaviorbasedon a deepening and broadening of their skills, knowledge, and worldviews

Informal learning: learning that may be intentional or incidental, is not highly structured, and is a volitional behavior
