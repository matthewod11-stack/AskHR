In our view, an in-person workplace operates well until you grow out of

a single room. Once you spread to other ﬂoors and locations, the work

becomes more virtual anyway. Hybrid, meanwhile, is the worst of both

worlds, because it creates a divide between those in the oﬃce and those

outside it. I think we can all admit that meetings with half the people in

a room and the other half on Zoom are typically disastrous.

At GitLab we believe that tech-enabled distributed teams are the future

of knowledge work. We’ve been able to hire exceptional talent from

all over the world and introduce our employees to a more ﬂexible

and productive kind of teamwork that has propelled our company to

new heights. But our success has rested on careful adherence to the

principles I’ve described. We hope that more organizations will follow

our lead and learn how to run an all-remote workplace well.
