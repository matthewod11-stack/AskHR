# Theoretical Issues

As important as the practical and methodological issues is the need for researchers to build theoretically sound models that place humor appro- priately within a causal network. Humor is both an elusive and ﬂexible construct. It adapts well to placement as an antecedent to many outcomes, but equally plausible arguments can often be developed that describe it as a consequence of particular conditions, or as one of many consequences of some phenomenon. For example, with respect to leadership, humor can be conceptualized as a manifestation of the social skills necessary for good leadership (Sala, 2000), or it can be seen as a tool for individuals to inﬂuence one another (e.g., Cooper, 2005). For creativity, humor can be seen as an event that primes an individual to think creatively, or perhaps both creativity and humor are caused by some third dispositional variable. To further complicate matters, humor might stand in a reciprocal relationship with other phenomena. Owren and Bachorowski’s (2003) work suggests such a relationship, wherein humor and laughter might be antecedents that promote positive affect, which in turn promotes more humor use, and so on. Finally, we note that the study of humor and culture in organizations requires that researchers consider the notion of ‘‘levels.’’ With respect to hierarchical levels, anthropological and sociological studies have paid particular attention to the direction of humor (e.g., who is allowed to produce humor) as well as the interpersonal contexts in which humor is
