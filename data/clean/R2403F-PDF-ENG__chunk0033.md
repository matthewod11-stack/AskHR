# Find Better Ways to Be Dexterous

When companies do restructure, they should avoid simply moving from

one rigid architecture to another, redrawing boxes on the org chart

and reassigning employees to new managers. A smarter approach is to

compartmentalize change by creating smaller P&L units that grow or

shrink based on needs in a company’s target markets. AIG was famous

for entering markets by creating new companies to go after them and

then shutting those ventures down if the markets became unproﬁtable.

That was no doubt painful—but not as painful as restructuring the

entire corporation ﬁrst to chase a new market and then again to exit it.
