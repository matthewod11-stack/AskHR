### **[The metacognitive blind spot of AI systems]{.underline}**

[Here\'s the paradox that makes this collaboration so powerful: AI
systems excel at helping us develop metacognition precisely because they
lack it themselves. Current AI doesn\'t know what it knows. It can\'t
reflect on its own thinking or recognize the boundaries of its
understanding. When ChatGPT generates a response, it\'s not thinking
about thinking --- it\'s generating statistically probable
text.]{.underline}

[This limitation becomes a feature when properly understood. Because AI
lacks metacognition, it approaches your thinking with a kind of naive
directness. It won\'t unconsciously filter observations through its own
metacognitive biases because it doesn\'t have any.]{.underline}
