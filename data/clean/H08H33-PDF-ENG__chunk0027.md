## Talent Density Is an Advantage in the AI Era

One ﬁnal reason to focus on increasing talent density rather than

expanding headcount is the radical transformation of business being

driven by AI.

While AI will change every company, your goal should be to leverage

AI swiftly to create a signiﬁcant competitive advantage. Nonetheless,

coping with that change will demand ever more ﬂexibility and learning

agility within your company. As a result, you need a highly focused,

well-aligned, and talent-dense team to drive this transformation. The

head of HR at OpenAI has told me a select few individuals are seen

as central to the company’s success, and that her role is to reward,

motivate, and cultivate more talent like them.

In my experience, companies that push for continual high performance

are energizing places to work that consistently deliver outstanding

products and services and are good long-term investment vehicles

for stakeholders. So, take a lesson from the best and emulate these

successful companies by committing to a policy where no one receives a

lanyard unless they contribute to your overall talent density, rather than

just adding to the headcount.
