# The Legal Process

76

chapter 

In the field of human resources (HR), it is not a question of whether you will

get sued by an applicant or former employee but when and how often. In  alone, , discrimination complaints were filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), resulting in more than $ million in awards and settlements. Although this number is considerably up from the , complaints filed in  and the , complaints filed in , the increase is probably due more to technology changes in the EEOC complaint process making it easier to file a complaint than it is to increased discrimina- tion (Leonard, ). These statistics should convince anyone entering the HR field that knowledge of employment law is essential (updated statistics can be obtained on the Web at www.eeoc.gov/stats/enforcement.html).

To know whether a given employment practice is legal, it is important to under- stand the legal process as it relates to employment law. The first step in the legal process is for some legislative body, such as the U.S. Congress or a state legisla- ture, to pass a law. If a law is passed at the federal level, states may pass laws that expand the rights granted in the federal law; states may not, however, pass laws that will diminish the rights granted in federal legislation. For example, if Con- gress passed a law that gave women six months of maternity leave, a state or local government could pass a law extending the leave to eight months, but it could not reduce the amount of maternity leave to less than the mandated six months. Thus, to be on firm legal ground, it is important to be aware of state and local laws as well as federal legislation.

Once a law has been passed, situations occur in which the intent of the law is not clear. For example, a law might be passed to protect disabled employees. Two years later, an employee is denied promotion because he has high blood pres- sure. The employee may file a charge against the employer claiming discrimina- tion based on a disability. He may claim that high blood pressure is a disability but that he can still work in spite of the disability and consequently deserves the promotion. The organization, on the other hand, might claim that high blood pressure is not a disability and that even if it were, an employee with high blood pressure could not perform the job. It would then be up to the courts to decide.
