A crisp elevator pitch isn’t useful just for times when you’re job hunting.

There are often opportunities to shape the way you’re perceived by

others, but most people miss them. For instance, new acquaintances

will often ask how long you’ve been at your job or how you came to

your current ﬁeld. Having a pithy answer ready means you can turn

their question into an opportunity to subtly highlight your skills: “I

started out in HR and worked my way up to director. But I became

fascinated by the sales process, and realized the listening skills and

ability to connect with people that I’d developed in HR would enable

me to add real value to the company, so I transitioned last year and am

now the head of northeast sales.” You haven’t just laid out your job titles;

you’ve provided context that conveys a strong personal brand.

Similarly, during performance reviews, you can make a point of

reminding your boss about how you’re leveraging key strengths you’ve

developed over time. For instance, you could connect this year’s

increase in client upsells to your work developing your team’s listening

skills so that they’re more attuned to client needs.

Share your ideas publicly. If you keep a low proﬁle and let your work

speak for itself, you may indeed develop a good reputation among the

people you work closely with. But that’s a relatively limited number of

people. Individuals in other departments or leaders many levels above you may not be aware of your contributions. And any staﬃng changes
