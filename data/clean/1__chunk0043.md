## Theme 3: Bias Detection and Algorithmic Accountability

Addressing algorithmic bias requires proactive meas ures, yet current industry practices often fall short Major concerns include:

- Historical Data Bias: AI models trained on historical hiring data inherit past biases, p erpetuating exclusionary practices. If an organization has historically hired fewer disabled workers, the AI may deem disabled candidates as less qualified (Binns & Kirkham, 2021).

- Lack of Bias Audits: While some companies conduct bias audits, these are neither standardized nor required. Many audits fail to account for disability -specific biases, focusing instead on gender or racial fairness (Ajunwa, 2021).

- Absence of Explainable AI (XAI): Without interpretable AI models, employers struggle to identify it difficult to detect and correct biased
