## Theme 2 - Ethical and Legal Challenges in AI Hiring Systems

AI hiring systems operate within an uncertain regulatory environment where ADA compliance is often an afterthought. Key findings:

- Opaque Decision-Making (“Black Box AI”): Many AI hiring tools lack transparency, which prevents candidates from understanding how hiring decisions occur. This opacity makes it difficult for disabled applicants to challenge rejections, leaving them without recourse (Kammerer, 2022).

- Regulatory Gaps: Current legal frameworks, such as the ADA, prohibit hiring discrimina tion but lack explicit provisions addressing AI -driven hiring systems. The lack of proactive enforcement leaves room for biased algorithms to operate unchecked (Friedman, 2022).

- Growing Litigation Risks: Cases such as Derek Mobley v. Workday Inc. (2024) underscore how AI hiring tools disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities. The legal scrutiny surrounding AI hiring underscores the urgent need for clearer compliance standards (Egger, 2021).
