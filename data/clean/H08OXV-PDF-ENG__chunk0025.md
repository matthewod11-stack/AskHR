Setting timeframes or journalling can be a useful way to track your

progress toward your goals, reﬂecting on what’s worked well and what

incremental actions have moved you toward an accomplishment can

help reignite your commitment.

That said, goals are only useful when you’re working toward them. If

a goal is starting to feel like a slog—and you feel yourself dreading

it or blowing it oﬀ—it’s probably a good time to adjust and look for

something that feels energizing and possible.
