One way to motivate your team, especially when they’re under ongoing

stress, is to show them the progress they’ve made. “Help people see

that it’s OK if they didn’t). You also want to connect them to the purpose

behind their work. “Bathe people with the positive impact of their work.

It’s like a booster shot — physiologically and psychologically,” she says.
