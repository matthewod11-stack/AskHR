## in experiments with more than 1,600 nationally representative U.S.

participants ranging in age from 18 to 86, I found that people chose

higher levels of vehicle automation for others than they did for

themselves. The reason? They believed that they were better drivers

than the automated vehicles were but that other people were not.

To increase utilization of AI systems, companies can restore consumers’

sense of agency by having people provide input to the systems (thereby

creating what are known as “human-in-the-loop systems”). Consider

Nest, a smart home product that allows users to customize it, such as by

manually adjusting thermostats or setting speciﬁc schedules. Its users

can choose between automated learning and manual input. A sense

of control can also be heightened by tweaking design elements of the

product. For example, iRobot programs the Roomba vacuum to move

in predictable paths rather than unpredictable ones that may make the

vacuum appear “alive.”

Allowing people to have too much control over AI systems can

potentially diminish the quality of their output and their eﬀectiveness,

however. Fortunately, studies ﬁnd that consumers need to retain only a

small amount of input to feel comfortable. Marketers can thus calibrate

AI systems so that there is an optimal balance between perceived
