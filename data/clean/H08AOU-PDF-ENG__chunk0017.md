## HBR / Digital Article / How to Equitably Assign High-Profile Work

First, instead of discussing the cognitive bases of bias or sweeping social

issues like patriarchy and structural racism, we focus tightly on how

bias plays out on the ground in everyday workplace interactions. Each

company opted to use their own WES data in their bias training to

describe what was actually going on at the company in question – using

both survey data and quotes to describe experiences of bias in a matter-

of-fact, non-accusatory way. One participant said: “I’ve attended a few

too many wishy-washy trainings. I love that [the workshop] … had really

hard data to back everything up.”

Second, people leave our workshops with concrete strategies for

interrupting bias. We accomplish this through breakout sessions of six

people where we present a scenario depicting a pattern of bias that

has been documented at the company, asking participants to discuss

ways they each individually would feel comfortable interrupting that

particular kind of bias the next time they see it. A participant in one

training said, “We loved the breakouts, and they went by too fast!”

That’s the point: We leave people wanting more, so that conversations

will continue long after the workshop is over.

Third, we typically train everyone at the company or in a department,

or all managers at once, so that junior employees see senior managers

making a commitment to address bias proactively, spurring the creation

of new organizational norms. For example, after one workshop, a senior

leader at the professional services ﬁrm declared, “I’m doing the oﬃce

housework today!” which likely helped to create a cultural shift at the

ﬁrm by setting an example for other managers to follow.

As always, sunshine is the best disinfectant: When leaders saw real data

from their own companies, they understood what bias looks like and used the simple, eﬀective ways they felt comfortable with to interrupt it.
