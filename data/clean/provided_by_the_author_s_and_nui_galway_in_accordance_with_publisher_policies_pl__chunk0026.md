The specific contribution of the current paper is in developing a clear and concise

definition of strategic talent management. We also develop a theoretical model of

strategic talent management. In so doing we draw insights from a number of discreet

literature bases. Thus, the paper should aid future research in the area of talent

management through (1) helping researchers to clarify the conceptual boundaries of

talent management and (2) providing a theoretical framework that could help researchers

in framing their research efforts in the area. Additionally, it aids managers in engaging

with some of the issues they face with regard to talent management.

2.0 WHAT IS TALENT MANAGMENT?

A cursory review of the talent management literature reveals a degree of debate as

to the conceptual boundaries of the topic. Indeed, Aston and Morton (2005: 30) noted that

there “...isn’t a single consistent or concise definition” of talent management.

Notwithstanding this criticism, Lewis and Heckman (2006) identified three key streams

of thought around the concept of talent management. First, those who merely substitute

the label talent management for human resource management. Studies in this tradition

often limit their focus to particular HR practices such as recruitment, leadership

development, succession planning and the like. The contribution of this literature is

relatively limited beyond the strategic HR literature, as it largely amounts to a rebranding

of HRM. A second strand of literature emphasises the development of talent pools

focusing on “projecting employee/staffing needs and managing the progression of

employees through positions” (Lewis and Heckman, 2006: 140). Studies in this tradition

typically build on earlier research in the manpower planning or succession planning

literatures. While adopting a relatively narrow focus, studies in this tradition at least

provide a degree of differentiation as to what talent management is vis-à-vis HRM. The

third stream focuses on the management of talented people. This literature argues that all

roles within the organisation should be filled with “A performers”, referred to as

“topgrading” (Smart, 1999) and emphasises the management of “C players”, or
