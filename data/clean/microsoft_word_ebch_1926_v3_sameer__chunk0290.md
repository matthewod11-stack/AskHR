tends to retain employees. In contrast, a toxic or hostile culture that tolerates harassment, discrimination, or bullying is likely to drive talented individuals to seek employment elsewhere.

- 7. Employee Engagement:

Engaged employees are more likely to stay with their current employer. Engaged employees feel a sense of purpose, have strong connections to their work, and are motivated to contribute to the organization's success. Companies that prioritize employee engagement through meaningful work, recognition, and opportunities for involvement tend to have lower turnover rates.

- 8. Workload and Stress:

Excessive workload and chronic stress can lead to employee burnout and, consequently, turnover. When employees feel overwhelmed or experience high levels of stress due to their job responsibilities, they may look for less demanding positions. Organizations must monitor workloads, provide necessary resources, and promote stress management to mitigate turnover.

- 9. Job Fit and Alignment:

Employees are more likely to stay with an organization if their skills, values, and interests align with their job roles. Job fit and alignment contribute to a sense of fulfillment and job satisfaction. When employees feel that their roles do not match their abilities or passions, they are more prone to seek employment elsewhere.

- 10. External Market Factors:

External market factors, such as economic conditions, industry trends, and labor market competitiveness, can influence employee turnover. In a booming job market with many opportunities, employees may be more inclined to explore alternative positions. Conversely, during economic downturns, job security concerns may discourage employees from leaving their current jobs.

- 11. Employee Benefits and Perks:

In addition to traditional compensation, organizations that offer attractive employee benefits and perks, such as remote work options, wellness programs, on-site childcare, and professional development opportunities, can reduce turnover. These extras can enhance the overall employee experience and make the organization a more appealing place to work[7], [8].

- 12. Location and Commute:

The location of an organization and the commuting requirements can affect turnover. Long and arduous commutes or unfavorable workplace locations may deter employees from staying in their current roles. This is particularly relevant for positions that require physical presence at a specific site. employee turnover is influenced by a multitude of factors, many of which are interconnected. Organizations must recognize that addressing turnover requires a holistic approach that encompasses job satisfaction, compensation, career development, work-life balance, leadership, culture, engagement, workload, job fit, external market conditions, benefits, and location. By identifying and addressing these factors, organizations can create an environment where employees are more likely to stay, resulting in lower turnover rates and a more stable and productive workforce.
