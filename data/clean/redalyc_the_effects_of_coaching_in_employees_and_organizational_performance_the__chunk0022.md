- 1. Introduction

In this complex and challenging business world, managing human capital is undoubtedly

critical to a firm’s success (Gurav & Muldakar, 2011; Núñez-Cacho & Grande, 2012). Thus,

businesses are continuously seeking opportunities to improve their competitiveness. Coaching

is one of many different human resource development practices that can help firms create an

advantageous position with respect to competitors. In fact, Diedrich (1996) and McCracken

and Heaton (2012) recognise the importance of coaching for employees and firms, viewing the

practice as an important tool for career development. A growing number of businesses use

coaching (Barlett, 2007; Chong, 2008; Moen & Allgood, 2009; Richard, Taylor, Barnett &

Nesbit, 2002) because the practice responds to the needs and demands of the workplace

(Sherman & Freas, 2004) and is also effective in other ways, such as correcting and improving

poor performance (Gravina & Siers, 2011) or conflict resolution in the workplace (Anderson,

Rayner & Schyns, 2009). Moreover, coaching can be used to accelerate career learning (Parker,

Hall & Kram, 2008) or to ensure sustainable leadership (Boyatzis, Smith & Blaine, 2006).

Nevertheless, despite the growing popularity of coaching and their supporters’ claim that the

practice helps improve performance in both employees and organisations, the literature offers

little empirical evidence regarding the effects of this practice (Agarwal, Angst & Magni, 2009).

Thus, there is a need to explore this process and its effects empirically (Gray, Ekinci &

Goregaokar, 2011a). This lack of evidence raises doubts regarding whether the substantial

investment in such programmes is justified. Researchers must also investigate the conditions

guaranteeing its effectiveness and determine whether firms implementing this practice are

following the optimal procedures. Most studies on this topic lack a theoretical framework,

which reflects the immaturity of the body of research on the subject. The largest gap in the

existing literature involves the coaching approaches that explain how this coaching works

(Segers, Vloeberghs, Henderick & Inceoglu, 2011). Thus, if we can show that coaching can

improve firm performance, then human resource managers would be able to justify using the

practice. In this case, coaching would be a best practice that improves organisational

performance regardless of other internal or external factors (Ely & Zaccaro, 2010; Huselid,

1993).
