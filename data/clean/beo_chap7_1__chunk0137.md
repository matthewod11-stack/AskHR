Despite the clear experimental evidence of escalation to commitment to bad

projects, there is little convincing field evidence of this pattern. Case studies of

managers who take over projects pull the plug on them. But the tendency to do so

might just reflect differences in prior beliefs rather than escalation by the managers

who initiated the bad projects (see, for example, Barsade et al. 1997; Weber and

Camerer 1999). The ideal situation for an empirical analysis would thus be

(i) data on similar types of decisions (such as plant closings) for a set of firms,

(ii) where in a strict subset the decision maker changed for exogenous reasons
