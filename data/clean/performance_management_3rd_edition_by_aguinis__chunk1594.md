# Part III • Employee Development

- Conduct self-appraisal. The second step includes asking the employee to summarize her accomplishments during the review period. This is more easily accomplished when the employee is given the appraisal form to be used by the supervisor before the meeting. This portion of the meeting allows the employee to provide her perspective regarding performance. The role of the supervisor is to listen to what the employee has to say and to summarize what he hears. This is not an appropriate time for the supervisor to disagree with what the employee says.

- Share ratings and explain rationale. Next, the supervisor explains the rating he pro- vided for each performance dimension and explains the reasons that led to each score. It is more effective to start with a discussion of the performance dimensions for which there is agreement between the employee’s self-appraisal and the super- visor’s appraisal. This is likely to reduce tension and to demonstrate to the employee that there is common ground and that the meeting is not confronta- tional. Also, it is better to start with a discussion of the performance dimensions for which the scores are highest and then move on to the dimensions for which the scores are lower. For areas for which there is disagreement between self- and supervisor ratings, the supervisor must take great care in discussing the reason for his rating and provide specific examples and evidence to support the score given. At this point, there should be an effort to resolve discrepancies, and the supervisor should take extra care with sensitive areas. The employee should be provided with the opportunity to explain her viewpoint thoroughly. This is a very useful discussion because it leads to clarifying performance expectations. For dimen- sions for which the score is low, there should be a discussion of the possible causes for poor performance. For example, are the reasons related to lack of knowledge, lack of motivation, or contextual factors beyond the control of the employee?

- Discuss development. After the supervisor and employee have agreed on the scores given to each performance dimension, there should be a discussion about the developmental plan. At this point, the supervisor and the employee should discuss and agree on the developmental steps that will be taken to improve performance in the future.

- Ask employee to summarize. Next, the employee should summarize, in her own words, the main conclusions of the meeting: what performance dimensions are satisfactory, which ones need improvement, and how improvement will be achieved. This is an important component of the meeting because it gives the supervisor an opportunity to determine whether he and the employee are in accord.

- Discuss rewards. The next step during the meeting includes discussing the rela- tionship between performance and any reward allocation. The supervisor should explain the rules used to allocate rewards and how the employee would be able to reach higher reward levels as a consequence of future performance improvement.

- Hold follow-up meeting. Before the meeting is over, it is important to schedule the next performance-related formal meeting. It is important that the employee understand that there will be a formal follow-up and that performance manage- ment is not just about meeting with the supervisor once a year. Usually, the next meeting will take place just a few weeks later to review whether the developmen- tal plan is being implemented effectively.
