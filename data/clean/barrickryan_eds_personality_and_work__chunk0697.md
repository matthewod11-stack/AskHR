# Personality Traits in Context

Relevant to the previous point, Mischel and his colleagues have launched a long-term research program focusing on why disposi- tions lead to behavioral regularities (Mischel & Shoda, 1998; Mis- chel, Shoda, & Mendoza-Denton, 2002). They contend that research needs to analyze traits in a way that allows for understanding how individuals interact with situations to produce stable situation- behavior patterns (see Murtha, Kanfer, & Ackerman, 1996). This new perspective leads to reﬁning what is meant by a person-by- situation interaction, what is considered stability, and what is con- sidered a change in dispositions or the dynamic individual processes that underlie interactions between persons and situations. As Mis- chel and Shoda (1998) note, “This view is that the personality sys- tem is active and indeed proactive, not just reactive—a system that anticipates, inﬂuences, rearranges, and changes situations as well as reacts to them. Thus the personality system and the behavior it generates selects, modiﬁes, and shapes the environment in recip- rocal transactions” (p. 239).

This perspective highlights that clearly explicating cause-and- effect relationships demands taking a more dynamic interactive ap- proach. Mischel and Shoda (1998) promote an approach that focuses on how an individual’s stable personality can be expressed as a pattern of both consistency and variation in the ﬂow of a per- son’s behavior. These researchers have data supporting recurrent patterns of behavior that can be high for a trait in some situations and low in other situations. As an example in organizations, an em- ployee may display agreeableness when being teased by a supervi- sor but aggressiveness when being teased by a peer. Mischel and Shoda would call an individual’s pattern of trait-situation interac- tions such as this one a behavioral signature.

In addition, Shoda (1999) notes that situations can be thought of as similar to or different from one another along two dimen- sions that are similar to what have been discussed in the training literature: the physical ﬁdelity of the situation (school setting ver- sus home setting) or the psychological ﬁdelity of the situation. Shoda notes that the underlying “psychologically active ingredi- ents” may be consistent across situations in some respects but not others. For instance, a particular school environment and work en-
