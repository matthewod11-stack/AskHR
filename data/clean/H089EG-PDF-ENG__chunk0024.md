You should also discuss their scope of decision-making on the project

— the choices that will require your consultation versus the ones they

During your check-ins, give your team member feedback on the

project or task you delegated, coach them, and provide them with any

resources they may need to move forward (if possible). That said, if

you have critical feedback, don’t immediately give it. It’s more useful

to ask questions that will help your direct report develop their own

understanding of what may need to be done diﬀerently. You can say,

“What went well from your perspective? What didn’t go as well as

hoped? What do we want to replicate (or not) next time?” Upon hearing

their thoughts, follow up with, “It’s helpful to hear your thinking on

this. Let me share with you what I see from where I am.”

Also use this time to recognize your team member’s eﬀorts, as your

encouragement may be just what they need to stay motivated. On longer

projects, if a milestone is reached, celebrate their accomplishments by

letting them know that you appreciate their work. Reiterate how their

eﬀorts are contributing to your team or larger organization. If the team

member likes to be praised in public, you can even write a brief team or

company-wide Slack message highlighting their work.

- 5) Review and reflect.

Once the project or task is completed, collaborate with your team

members on a retrospective review to reﬂect on how the process went
