## Individual Developmental Plans at General Mills

At General Mills (http://www.generalmills.com), individual developmental plans (IDPs) are promoted strongly throughout the company. The Minneapolis, Minnesota-based General Mills is an interna- tional foods company. Some of the best-known brands include Pillsbury, Cheerios, Green Giant, and Yoplait. The formally written IDPs are completed annually, but the expectation is for ongoing conversations between managers and employees, focusing not only on competencies that are well developed and those that are in need of improvement but also on the employee’s career aspirations. The company’s IDP sessions promote the process for employees by hosting speakers, offering Web- based learning tools, and holding workshops for employees and managers to get the most out of the process. Some of these sessions are specifically tailored to different kinds of positions within the company with different needs in the development process. Also, the IDP is kept separate from the annual performance appraisal, as the belief is that development planning cannot be sufficiently addressed in the context of appraisal. In summary, General Mills provides an example of a company that has made a strong commitment to the growth and learning of all employees.3
