## Strengths, limitations, and future research avenues

We can point out four important strengths of our study. First, this is one of the first studies that examines the number of athlete leaders on the team and, more importantly, relates that number of leaders to the team’s effectiveness in order to establish which structures are the most beneficial. Second, in contrast to previous research, we did not only include positive indi- cators of team effectiveness (e.g., performance), but we also assessed possible barriers to effec- tive team functioning (e.g., team conflict). As such, we could obtain a deeper insight about the positive—and potentially also the negative—outcomes of a specific leadership structure. Third, the study is carried out with a large sample of high-level professional players, participants that are difficult to access but who provide very useful information on what goes on in high-perfor- mance sports teams. Finally, it should be noted that evaluation of athlete leadership was based
