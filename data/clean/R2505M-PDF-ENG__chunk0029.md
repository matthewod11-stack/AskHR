## A Streamlined Approach to Systems Thinking

To reap the advantages of systems thinking you don’t need to precisely

model a complex adaptive system. Instead, you can develop a general

understanding of critical patterns in the system and then collaborate

with actors in the ecosystem to test simple ideas. The goal is to

experiment, not to make wholesale, potentially catastrophic changes. A

good nudge will often inspire new ideas that can transform the system.

Our streamlined approach to systems thinking has four key steps.

- 1. Deﬁne your desired future state. Standard practice in design

thinking, and to some extent in breakthrough thinking, is to address

the “job to be done” or the “unarticulated need” of the customer.
