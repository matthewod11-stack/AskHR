# Using Case Studies to Apply Knowledge

Once employees have received the information they need through lecture, it is important that they be able to apply what they have learned. One way to do this is through the case study. Case studies are similar to leaderless group discussions and situational interview problems (which were discussed in Chapter ), and are considered to be good sources for developing analysis, synthesis, and evaluation skills (Noe, ). With this method, the members of a small group each read a case, which is either a real or hypothetical situation typical of those encoun- tered on the job. The group then discusses the case, identifies possible solutions, evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of each solution, and arrives at what it thinks is the best solution to the problem.

For case studies to be most successful, the cases should be taken from actual situations. For example, to make their case study more realistic, General Elec- tric employees in New York use actual information about a problem within the company. Trainees not only discussed the problem but interviewed employees to gather more information. This use of a living case was found to be superior to the typical case study. Not only was the problem relevant, but also the solution could actually be used, thus providing an incentive for the trainees to take the training program seriously. A drawback to the living case study, however, is that trainees may not be the best individuals to solve the problem.

In addition to being realistic, case studies should be interesting. They are best when they are written in the form of a story, contain dialogue between the char- acters, use realistic details, are descriptive and easy to follow, contain all informa- tion necessary to solve the problem, and are difficult enough to be challenging (Owenby, ).

To increase the effectiveness of case studies, trainees should first be taught the principles involved in solving a particular type of problem, helped to use those principles in discussing the case, and then have the principles reinforced after reading the case study. If the key principles are not taught and reinforced, trainees tend to focus too much on the content of a particular case study when trying to solve future problems rather than using the key principles (Allen & Connelly, ).
