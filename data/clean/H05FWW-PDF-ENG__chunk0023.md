## Edmans at the London Business School and Rob Markey at Bain &

Company reinforces the importance of establishing this balance. Their

studies show that companies with high employee satisfaction and high Net

Promoter Scores materially outperform their peers.

It’s up to boards to narrow the focus to two to three mission-based

measures that will serve as the basis for a long-term incentive plan, and

then to set goals based on those measures. The goals need to be both

speciﬁc enough to guide actions and measurable enough to show

performance improvement. To complement the long-term goals, directors

should set annual incentive objectives as intermediate milestones to gauge

progress toward long-term outcomes. Using the Southwest example, this

could be the percentage of on-time ﬂights as compared to all ﬂights.
