# HBR / Digital Article / Why Cross-Functional Collaboration Stalls, and How to Fix It

use a “trust matrix” to document and track critical relationships at both

the C-level and among lower-level leadership teams. The ratings are

updated twice a year and are completely transparent to members of the

executive leadership team, encouraging candor and accountability.

Inﬁnera believes the primary value of the exercise comes from its ability

to stimulate thinking and discussion about the reason behind certain

ratings, which helps reveal sources of tension that could otherwise go

unnoticed. The ratings, and reasons behind them, help identify where

drag is occurring and prompt teams to talk about issues impeding

collaboration success. Although senior management suggests speciﬁc

solutions to challenges, such as where resources can be redeployed

or communication improved, team leaders themselves are expected to

address these relationship issues and formulate concrete action plans.

Broader awareness of the health of critical relationships will enable

leaders to assess where collaboration is dragging. To get started,

executives should approach peers in other functions who already see

their area of the business as critical to achieving shared goals. Capture

feedback in a shared document that is transparent for all involved, and

then meet to discuss what’s driving the feedback. Teams within speciﬁc

functions can also leverage this practice to monitor their dynamics.
