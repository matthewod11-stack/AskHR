# INTRODUCTION

Stratification scholars have revealed structural inequalities across nations and over time along the lines of class, gender, and race (Crompton and Mann, 1986; Lam, 2004). Various patterns of inequality have been distinguished: inequality of outcome, opportunity, merit, and entitlement (Baker, Lynch, Cantillon and Walsh, 2004). A growing awareness of gender inequality as well as a conviction that this inequality should be eliminated has produced a number of studies aiming at uncovering the reasons for it (e.g., Acker, 2006a; Kanter, 1977; Neff , Cooper and Woodruff, 2007; Reskin, 2003; Sen, 1995; Teigen and Wängnerud, 2009).

Whatever the level of gender inequality measured by different indicators, there is also a subjective dimension, which concerns how visible it is for individuals. Visibility of inequality, defined as ‘the degree of awareness of inequality’ (Acker, 2006a: 452), may vary considerably. Acker (2006a) argued that people generally see inequality as existing somewhere else, not where they are. Gender inequality is not an exception. It tends to ‘disappear’ among organizational members or is seen as something that does not exist in specific organizations (Acker, 2006a; Ely and Meyerson, 2000; Korvajärvi, 1998; 2003).

While van den Brink and Stobbe (2009) empirically examined perceived gender inequality in organizations, followed by Durbin and Fleetwood (2010) who studied perceived gender inequality in employment, few studies have compared to some extent the way people perceive both societal and workplace gender inequality (Acker, 2006a; Hearn, Piekkari and Jyrkinen, 2009). However, it is important to investigate the distinction between perceptions of societal and workplace gender inequality since it may reveal visibility of societal gender inequality among individuals and its disappearance in their own workplaces. By exploring social psychological aspects of both societal and workplace gender inequality through a large scale survey, the present study broadens our knowledge about the perceived gender inequality.

Previous studies have shown that such factors as gender, age, education, marital status are related to individuals’ perceptions of gender inequality (e.g., Davis and Robinson, 1991;
