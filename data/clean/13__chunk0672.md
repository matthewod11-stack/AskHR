## Toward a Theory of Reputation in Organizations

common ground upon which to build one. Common throughout the published work on reputation in a number of disciplines is the notion that personal reputation refers to a generally agreed upon, collective perception of an individual by some referent others, inﬂuenced by the individual actors themselves, and which does not occur instantaneously, but emerges over some period of time (e.g., Ferris et al., 2003).

From their review, Ferris et al. (2003) distilled a deﬁnition of personal reputation that emphasized the perceptual character of the construct, its intentional nature, its focus on behaviors and characteristics of the individual actor, and its occurrence over time. Furthermore, they implicitly made reference to reputation as reﬂecting a collective perception by others, and possessing a predictive quality by increasing the likelihood of future behavior. Thus, we employ the deﬁnition of personal reputation developed by Ferris et al. (2003), with the speciﬁc addition of the importance of collective per- ception and the reduced uncertainty of expected future behavior as follows: Reputation is a perceptual identity formed from the collective perceptions of others, which is reﬂective of the complex combination of salient personal characteristics and accomplishments, demonstrated behavior, and intended images presented over some period of time as observed directly and/or reported from secondary sources, which reduces ambiguity about expected future behavior.
