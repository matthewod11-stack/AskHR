Multi-source appraisal, therefore, offers a solution to some of the problems highlighted by CCL's research and thus it can be argued that the growth and development of 3608 feedback was significantly enhanced by CCL's findings on feedback and learning in the workplace. A number of other factors acted as catalysts in the evolution of multi-source appraisal and these are discussed in turn below.

The first of these factors is the employee

attitude survey (Edwards and Ewen, 1996; Tornow and London, 1998). These surveys typically set out to explore employee satisfaction with the organisation on several different dimensions including policies, procedures, work environment, pay and benefits. Edwards and Ewen (1996) suggest that, in the 1970s and 1980s, surveys focused more on satisfaction with immediate leadership. In essence, the multi-source appraisal process is closely related to the tenets of the employee satisfaction survey. Edwards and Ewen suggest that the natural next step beyond departmental surveys was either upward feedback or multi-source feedback and hence the evolution and development of 3608 feedback systems by organisations.
