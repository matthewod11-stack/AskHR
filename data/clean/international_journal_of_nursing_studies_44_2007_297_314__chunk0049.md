# themes: quality of

leadership,

(2003) also reported associations between leadership and intent to leave, but acknowl- edged that this was an indirect link. Their US study collected data (n ¼ 90, RR ¼ 60%) via nine subscales of the Multifactor Leadership Scale (Bass and Avolio, 1995) with varying numbers of items in each subscale: transformational leadership (5), transactional leadership (3), non-transactional (1) and leadership outcomes (3). Intent to leave was measured using a single item (deﬁnitely will not leave ¼ 1, deﬁnitely will leave ¼ 5). The results of stepwise multiple regression suggested that leadership was not directly related to intent to leave but indirectly related through various other predictors. Transformational leadership style was found to predict psychological empowerment of nurses (po0:001) which in turn predicted an increase in job satisfaction (po0:001) which was then a major predictor of a decrease in intent to leave (po0:001). These ﬁndings illustrate the complexity involved in various perceptual and attitudinal factors contributing to an individual’s intention to leave.
