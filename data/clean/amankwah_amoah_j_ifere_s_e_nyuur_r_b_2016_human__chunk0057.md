Our data indicate that across the two countries, some firms have kept underperforming

workers as a “bridging strategy” to build bridges with local communities. By originating from

a particular ethnic group, such individuals are seen to bring a degree of legitimacy to their

firms. For firms desperately seeking legitimacy in the community, keeping such workers

provides a means of demonstrating their engagement to the local community. Such

individuals also act as joints and protect their firms from accusations of exploiting the local

community. Some workers in this category represented symbolic tokens to convince locals

that the firm represented their values and traditions. As one foreign-owned business co-owner

noted:

“When we moved the business here, some of the locals did not like us and even threatened

our business … so we have two workers that can be seen as ‘underperforming’ but they have

strong links in the community – that is why we have kept them … they are helping us to

reduce the tension.” (G15)

Another informant concurred:

“Yes! A decade ago … his incompetence caused the company a fortune including the cost of

his retraining and coaching. The other staff were not pleased with the decision … he was a

native of the area and we kept him in the business.”(G6)
