# Ask open-ended questions…

When your boss makes a decision that you think is misguided or wrong,

resist the urge to scoﬀ or roll your eyes. Instead, Martin recommends

asking tactful, open-ended questions to gain clarity on your boss’s

reasoning. Questions like: “How does this help the business?” “Why is

this beneﬁcial for the team?” and “What are you trying to achieve?” can

be posed in team meetings or during one-on-ones.

Tone is everything, says Banu. Approach the conversation with curiosity

and respect. “Don’t sound threatening or accusatory.” She suggests

saying something like, “Can you share some of the factors behind this

choice?” to demonstrate your willingness to “understand and work

together.”

… and provide feedback

Getting a grip on your boss’s motivations puts you in a better position

to oﬀer feedback and propose diﬀerent ideas. Be diplomatic and

constructive when expressing reservations, and frame your feedback as

a way to achieve shared goals.“Egos are at play, so you need to create a

safe space for conversation that conveys the message, ‘I am with you,’”

says Banu. “Look for common ground.”

Martin recommends asking your boss whether they’re willing to hear

alternative approaches. “Try saying, ‘Would you be open to a suggestion

that might make this strategy even better?’” he says. “Most leaders are

going to want to listen.”
