## 10.1 TRADITIONAL AND CONTINGENT PAY PLANS

A traditional approach in implementing reward systems is to reward employees for the positions they fill as indicated by their job descriptions and not necessarily by how they do their work. In other words, employees are rewarded for filling a specific slot in the organizational hierarchy. In such traditional pay systems, one’s job directly determines pay and indirectly determines benefits and incentives received. Typically, there is a pay range that determines minimum, midpoint, and maximum rates for each job. For example, a university may have five ranks for professors who have just been hired:

- 1. Instructor (pay range: $30,000(cid:3)$45,000) 2. Senior instructor (pay range: $40,000(cid:3)$55,000) 3. Assistant professor (pay range: $60,000(cid:3)$90,000) 4. Associate professor (pay range: $85,000(cid:3)$105,000) 5. Professor (pay range: $100,000(cid:3)$140,000)

As noted above, in a traditional reward system, each of these positions would have a minimum, midpoint, and the maximum salary. For assistant professors, the minimum is $60,000 per year, the midpoint is $75,000, and the maximum is $90,000. Salary increases at the end of the year would be determined by seniority or by a percentage of one’s base salary (and the same percentage would be used for all workers). Rewards would not be based on teaching quality, as indicated by student teaching ratings, or research productivity, as indicated by the number and quality of publications. If an assistant professor’s base salary is $90,000, she cannot realize an increase in her salary unless she is promoted to associate professor because $90,000 is the maximum possible salary for this job title. In short, in traditional reward systems, the type of position and seniority are the determinants of salary and salary increases, not performance. In such reward systems, there is no relationship between performance management and rewards. This type of system is quite pervasive in numerous organizations, particularly outside of North America. Korea is one country where systems based on seniority are still quite pervasive.1 In Korea, as is the case in other collectivistic cultures (e.g., China), employees tend to avoid confrontation for fear of losing face.2 Thus, supervisors may be reluctant to give employees unsatisfactory
