## Diﬀ erences Between I/O and Business Programs

Perhaps the best place to begin a textbook on I/O psychology is to look at the field itself. Industrial/organizational psychology is a branch of psychology that applies the principles of psychology to the workplace. The purpose of I/O psy- chology is “to enhance the dignity and performance of human beings, and the organizations they work in, by advancing the science and knowledge of human behavior” (Rucci, ).

For example, principles of learning are used to develop training programs and incentive plans, principles of social psychology are used to form work groups and understand employee conflict, and principles of motivation and emotion are used to motivate and satisfy employees. The application of psychological princi- ples is what best distinguishes I/O psychology from related fields typically taught in business colleges. Although many of the topics covered in this text are simi- lar to those found in a human resource management (HRM) or organizational behavior text, the techniques and the reasons behind them are often different. For example, many HRM texts advocate the unstructured interview as an excellent solution for selecting the best employees. I/O psychologists, however, consider unstructured interviews to be of less value than more suitable alternatives such as psychological tests, behavioral interviews, work samples, biodata, and assess- ment centers (Berry, ).

A second difference between I/O psychology and business fields is that I/O psychology examines factors that affect the people in an organization as opposed to the broader aspects of running an organization such as marketing channels, trans- portation networks, and cost accounting (Kimbrough, Durley, & Muñoz, ). As you can see from the typical graduate courses listed in Figure ., business (MBA) programs examine such areas as accounting, economics, and marketing, whereas I/O programs focus almost exclusively on issues involving the people in an organization (Murphy, Watson-El, Williams, & Wood, ).
