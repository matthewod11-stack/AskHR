Leadership at all levels must genuinely commit to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion

to create a workplace culture that fully embraces these values. While there may be a long

road ahead, continuing the conversation and taking action to effect positive change is

imperative. There is vast scope for further study of the factors affecting diversity and inclusion

in the workplace. Diversity management practices can be compared between industries, and

their impact on employee productivity and job satisfaction can be studied. There is also vast

scope for studies of perceptions of workplace diversity in different ethnic groups, religion-

based groups, and marginalized groups.
