## Differences between male and female teams

Previous studies failed to provide more insight about whether the ideal leadership structure differs for male and female teams. Gender differences have been demonstrated, however, with respect to leader characteristics. For example, Fransen et al. [35] found that female leaders were more likely to occupy a central position (i.e., having significant interaction with other players) than male leaders in field hockey. Moran and Weiss [36] added that female leaders were characterized by ability variables, while male leaders were characterized by psychosocial and ability variables. However, other studies did not find these gender differences when identi- fying leaders’ characteristics [37].

Also with respect to group dynamics, researchers have found differences in male and female teams [22–24]. For example, the relationship between cohesion and performance was observed to be significantly larger for females than for males [24]. It should be noted that, for the other variables of interest, no gender differences have yet been investigated. As Leo et al. [33] sug- gested, it would be interesting to achieve a better insight about how these group processes, and more specifically the benefits of a particular athlete leadership structure, might differ for male and female athletes. Given the lack of previous evidence of potential differences with respect to
