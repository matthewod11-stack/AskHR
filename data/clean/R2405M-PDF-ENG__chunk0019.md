## The ﬁrst slide read, “Backward Integration into Sugar Farming.”

Although Assoua Group still imported raw sugar from Brazil, Koﬃ and

Yao had purchased 70,000 hectares of land in the Zanzan District of

their country a decade earlier but had dithered over whether to develop it.2

“This is an obvious ﬁrst move,” Aminata said. “We know the market

price because we’re already importers and distributors. Demand is

consistent for sugar, and the major capital investment was the purchase

of the land, which we’ve completed. This will provide jobs for thousands

of local farmers. We have the land and the climate to grow our own food

and nutrients—there’s no need to keep importing them.”
