## 4.2.2 Factors Influencing Determinants of Performance

The factors that determine performance are affected by the employee (i.e., abilities and previous experience), human resources (HR) practices, and the work environment. For ex- ample, some companies offer more opportunities for training than do others. At the top of the list in terms of annual training investment are IBM ($1 billion), Accenture ($717 million), and Ford Motor ($500 million).5 In these companies, declarative knowledge is not likely to be a big problem because, when lack of knowledge is identified, employees have multiple opportunities to fill in the gap. However, performance problems may be related more to procedural knowledge and motivation. In terms of procedural knowledge, employees may actually have the knowledge to perform certain tasks but may not have the skill to do them because of lack of opportunity for practice. In terms of motivation, downsizing interven- tions may have caused a “survivor syndrome,” which includes retained employees’ feelings of frustration, resentment, and even anger. These feelings are likely to have strong negative effects on motivation, and employees may expend minimal energy on their jobs. Thus, there are three individual characteristics that determine performance: procedural knowledge, declarative knowledge, and motivation. In addition, HR practices and the work environment can affect performance. When addressing performance problems, managers first need to identify which of these factors is hampering performance and then help the employee improve his or her performance.
