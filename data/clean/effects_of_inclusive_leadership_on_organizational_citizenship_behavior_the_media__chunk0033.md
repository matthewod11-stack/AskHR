Note: * p < .05; ** p < .01; *** p < .001; gender (0 = women, 1 = men), age (0 = less than 25, 1 = 25–39, 2 = 40–60, 3 = more than 60), educational level (0 = less than bachelor’s, 1 = bachelor’s, 2 = master’s, 3 = PhD), organizational tenure (0 = less than 2 years; 1 = 2–4 years, 2 = 5–10 years, 3 = more than 10 years).

they account for theoretically meaningful amounts of variance explained.
