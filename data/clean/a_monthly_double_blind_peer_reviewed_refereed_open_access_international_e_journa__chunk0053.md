# graphical example of Maslow's model.

According to Maslow, you wouldn't be able to motivate someone with positive feedback

(an esteem factor) if their basic physiological needs aren't met. This makes sense

if you apply it to the workplace. If someone doesn't get paid enough to put food on

the table for his or her family, he or she isn't going to care too much about a 'good job'
