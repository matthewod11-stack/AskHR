Artifacts A final element of nonverbal communication concerns the objects, or artifacts, that a person wears or with which she surrounds herself. A person who wears bright and colorful clothes is perceived differently from a person who wears conservative white or gray clothing. Similarly, the manager who places all of her awards on her office wall, the executive with a large and expensive chair, and the student who carries a briefcase rather than a book bag are all making nonverbal statements about themselves.

Research on visitors’ perceptions of certain office characteristics has resulted in several interesting but not necessarily surprising findings. One line of research examined the perceptions of visitors to offices that used either open or closed desk arrangements. An open desk arrangement faces a desk against a wall so that a visitor can sit next to the person who sits behind the desk. A closed desk arrangement places a desk so that a visitor must sit across from the person behind the desk.

Visitors to offices that use open rather than closed desk arrangements perceive the offices to be more comfortable, and their occupants as friendlier and more trustworthy, open, interested, and extraverted (Campbell, ; McElroy, Morrow, & Wall, ; Widgery & Stackpole, ). Visitors rate people with messy offices as being active and busy, those with clean offices as being organized and intro- verted, and those with organized offices (lots of papers placed in stacks) as being active and achievement oriented (McElroy et al., ; Morrow & McElroy, ). Finally, visitors rate offices with plants and posters as more comfortable, inviting, and hospitable than offices without plants and posters (Campbell, ).

Recently, thinking about the placement of desks in an office has gone beyond the simple concept of visitor reactions. Office decorating experts (e.g., Too, ) using the concepts of feng shui—the Chinese art of placement and design—advise that, to properly use the energy of a room, desks:

should never be placed directly across from a doorway should always face away from a wall should never be placed in the center of the room

Research on office design is not only interesting, but also important. A super- visor with a messy office and a closed desk arrangement is sending the message that he does not want to be bothered. This may not be his intended message, but it is the one perceived by his subordinates. Thus, if this supervisor wants to be more open and improve communication with his employees, he might start by changing the appearance of his office.

Clearly, people make judgments about others based on their office, and the next logical step is to determine whether people with different types of offices actually have different types of personalities. Limited research, in fact, does seem to show that the appearance of an office provides insight into the personality of the occupant.

McElroy, Morrow, and Ackerman () looked at the personalities of faculty members who had open desk arrangements and those who had closed desk arrangements, and found that those with open desk arrangements were more extraverted and “people oriented” than their closed-desk counterparts. Further- more, faculty members who used open desk arrangements had lower external locus of control and scored higher on the Least-Preferred Coworker (LPC) Scale, which is discussed in Chapter .

In another study, Zweigenhaft () compared desk placement using several variables and found that older, higher-status faculty members used closed desk arrangements more than did younger members. Even more interesting was the finding that faculty members who used closed desk arrangements were also eval- uated less favorably in the classroom. Thus, desk placement was able to partially predict the effectiveness of a faculty member, providing support for the idea that different types of people arrange their offices in different ways.

In a study of personnel managers, Cochran, Kopitzke, and Miller () com- pared the office characteristics used by managers with their personalities. They found that dominant, achievement-oriented managers did not decorate their offices with anything other than standard furniture; more outgoing managers had photographs of their vacations to remind them of good times and a clock to let them know when it was quitting time; introverted managers had plants and paintings so that their office would remind them of home; and organized manag- ers had cartoons to show that even though they were neat and compulsive, they also had a sense of humor.

The presence of windows is another factor that seems to affect the way an office is decorated. Heerwagen and Orians () examined the ways people decorated both windowed and windowless offices and found that occupants of windowless offices used twice as many decorative items such as posters, pictures, and paintings. Not surprisingly, the posters in windowless offices contained more landscapes and fewer cityscapes than did offices with windows.
