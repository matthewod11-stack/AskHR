actual cost of turnover for any given position can be more accurately estimated using a formula such as one of those found on the text website. employee satisfaction and commitment 393 394 chapter  In terms of turnover in an organization, there are four views on the effect of performance on such factors as safety, productivity, and profitability. These are: 7 7 7 7 There is a negative correlation such that higher turnover rates will result in lower organizational performance. Because some turnover is healthy for an organization, there is a U-shaped relationship between turnover and performance such that very low or very high levels of turnover will result in lower organizational performance, but a moderate amount of turnover will result in higher performance. The negative effect of turnover is strongest when an organization’s turnover rate is low, and this effect then diminishes as turnover rates climb. The effect of turnover on organizational performance is mediated by the strength of an organization’s HR efforts. Turnover will most affect organizations that don’t invest in their employees and will least affect organizations that spend time and money to develop their employees. Though all four theories make good sense, research seems to support the idea that an employee leaving an organization will most affect an organization’s performance when the monthly turnover rate for the organization is low and will have a diminishing effect on performance when the turnover rate is high (Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, ). Reducing Turnover Because of the high cost of turnover, as well as its negative effect on organiza- tional performance (Glebbeek & Bax, ), organizations make tremendous efforts to reduce the number of quality employees that quit their jobs. An orga- nization reducing the number of employees leaving by one per month will save $, a year for a $, job and $, a year for a $, job. The first step in reducing turnover is to find out why your employees are leav- ing. This is usually done by administering attitude surveys to current employees and conducting exit interviews with employees who are leaving. Salary surveys can also be useful because they allow you to compare your organization’s pay and benefit practices with those of other organizations. Surveys are important because there appears to be a real disconnect between the reasons managers think employees leave and the actual reasons: % of managers believe employees leave for more money, yet % of employees say they left for other reasons (Branham, ). It is important to understand that employee turnover is a process of disen- gagement from the organization that can take days, weeks, or months (Branham, ). So, employees don’t awaken one day and just decide to leave. Instead, they have been thinking about it for a period of time, which means that better commu- nication between employees and management might prevent the ultimate decision to leave. Employees typically leave their jobs for one of five reasons: unavoidable reasons, advancement, unmet needs, escape, and unmet expectations. Unavoidable Reasons. Unavoidable turnover includes such reasons as school starting (e.g., quitting a summer job) or ending (e.g., a student quits her job as a part-time receptionist because she has graduated and will be moving), the job transfer of a spouse, employee illness or death, or family issues (e.g., employees staying home to raise their children or take care of their parents). Though employers are taking steps to reduce turnover due to family issues, there is little an organization can do to prevent turnover due to these other reasons. Advancement. Employees often leave organizations to pursue promotions or better pay. When an organization has few promotion opportunities, there is little it can do to reduce turnover for those employees seeking advancement. A solution used by an increasing number of police departments who have limited promotion opportunities is to allow officers with extensive experience and skills to advance to status positions such as master officer or senior officer. Such positions have no supervisory responsibility but do bring an increase in pay and status. At times, employers can reduce turnover by offering more pay; however, this will work only if a low compensation or an inadequate benefits package is the prime reason for employees leaving the organization. Furthermore, any increase in pay must be a meaningful amount. That is, if an organization increases pay by $,, yet other organizations are paying $, more, the increase in pay most probably will not decrease turnover. Unmet Needs. Employees whose needs are unmet will become dissatisfied and per- haps leave the organization. For example, if an employee has high social needs and the job involves little contact with people, or if an employee has a need for appre- ciation and recognition that is not being met by the organization, the employee might leave to find a job in which her social needs can be met. To reduce turnover caused by unmet needs, it is important that an organization consider the person/ organization fit when selecting employees. That is, if an applicant has a need for structure and close supervision, but the culture of the organization is one of inde- pendence, full of “free spirits,” the applicant should not be hired because there would be a poor fit between the employee’s need and the organization. Escape. A common reason employees leave an organization is to escape from people, working conditions, and stress. When conflict between an employee and her super- visor, a coworker, or customers becomes unbearable, the employee may see no option other than to leave the organization. Therefore, it is important to effectively deal with conflict when it occurs (this is covered in detail in Chapter ). Likewise, if working conditions are unsafe, dirty, boring, too strenuous, or too stressful, there is an increased likelihood that the employee will seek employment in an organization with better working conditions. Providing a mentor to help the employee deal with workplace problems may be a way to reduce turnover (Payne & Huffman, ). Unmet Expectations. Employees come to an organization with certain expecta- tions about a variety of issues, such as pay, working conditions, opportunity for advancement, and organizational culture. When reality does not match these expectations, employees become less satisfied and, as a result, are more likely to leave the organization (Griffeth et al., ). As discussed in Chapter , turnover due to unmet expectations can be reduced by providing applicants with realistic job previews. To summarize, organizations can reduce turnover in these ways: 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 Conduct realistic job previews during the recruitment stage. Select employees who have been referred by a current employee, who have friends and/or family working for the organization, and who did not leave their previous job after only a short tenure (Barrick & Zimmerman, ). Look for a good person/organization fit during the selection interview. Meet employee needs (e.g., safety, social, growth). Mediate conflicts between employees and their peers, supervisors, and customers. Provide a good work environment. Provide a competitive pay and benefits package. Provide opportunities to advance and grow. employee satisfaction and commitment 395 Dissatisfied employees often act out 396 chapter  There are many times when employees remain with an organization even though characteristics of their jobs suggest that they would leave. Lee, Mitchell, Sablynski, Burton, and Holtom () suggest that the extent to which an employee is embedded in the organization or the community might explain this lack of turn- over. Embeddedness is described as the extent to which employees have links to their jobs and community, the importance of these links, and the ease with which these links could be broken and reestablished elsewhere. That is, if an employee has many friends at work or in the community, is actively involved in community orga- nizations, and has a spouse who also has an excellent job, it would be difficult to leave an organization if the only alternative was to relocate to another community.
