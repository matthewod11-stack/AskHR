understanding the impact of leadership styles via SET. While trust in the leader is one

important example of this, other, potentially overlapping or broader social exchange based

variables, may also be in operation (Hughes et al., 2018). Most critical would be LMX

quality which has been identified as the second most common operationalisation of SET with

higher content validity than the more commonly used perceived organisational support

(Colquitt et al., 2014). Given the leader-follower context of the relationships we are focused

on, LMX quality is also the most contextually specific operationalisation of the SET

relationship and its utility as a mediator in the relationship between leadership and outcomes

has received considerable support (e.g. Gu et al., 2013). As such, trust and LMX quality offer
