# limited segmentation.

Show me (10 points). The length of time it takes you to launch a

personalized campaign is a good barometer of your company’s maturity

on this dimension. (Laggard organizations take 12 or more weeks, but

leaders take a few days.) It is also worth assessing how advanced your

automated content creation and management capabilities are. Leaders

leverage well-tagged content libraries and the latest gen AI solutions,

paired with automated content creation processes, whereas laggards

manually create each campaign, with little reuse of assets.

Delight me (10 points). Measure how well and how quickly you can test,

learn from, and improve the customer experience. Diagnose whether

you have organizational or technological impediments to measuring

progress on personalization and implementing improvements on a

weekly or more frequent basis. Leaders learn 10 times as fast as laggards

do; they run hundreds of experiments and turn around improvements

in days, while laggards take many months to achieve the same feat.
