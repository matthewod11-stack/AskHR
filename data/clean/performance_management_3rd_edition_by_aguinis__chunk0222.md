- Acceptability and fairness. A good system is acceptable and is perceived as fair by all participants. Perceptions of fairness are subjective and the only way to know if a system is seen as fair is to ask the participants about the system. Such percep- tions include four distinct components. First, we can ask about distributive justice, which includes perceptions of the performance evaluation received relative to the work performed, and perceptions of the rewards received relative to the evaluation received, particularly when the system is implemented across countries. For exam- ple, differences in perceptions may be found in comparing employees from more individualistic (e.g., United States) to more collectivistic (e.g., Korea) cultures.49 If a discrepancy is perceived between work and evaluation or between evaluation and rewards, then the system is likely to be seen as unfair.50 Second, we can ask about procedural justice, which includes perceptions of the procedures used to determine the ratings as well as the procedures used to link ratings with rewards. Third, we can assess perceptions regarding interpersonal justice, which refers to the quality of the design and implementation of the performance management system. For ex- ample, what are employees’ perceptions regarding how they are treated by their supervisors during the performance review meeting? Do they feel that supervisors are empathic and helpful? Finally, informational justice refers to fairness perceptions about performance expectations and goals, feedback received, and the information given to justify administrative decisions. For example, are explanations perceived to be honest, sincere, and logical? Because a good system is inherently discrimina- tory, some employees will receive ratings that are lower than those received by other employees. However, we should strive to develop systems that are regarded as fair from the distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational perspec- tives because each type of justice perception leads to different outcomes.51 For example, a perception that the system is not fair from a distributive point of view is likely to lead to a poor relationship between employee and supervisor and lowered satisfaction of the employee with the supervisor. On the other hand, a perception that the system is unfair from a procedural point of view is likely to lead to de- creased employee commitment toward the organization and increased intentions to leave.52 One way to improve all four justice dimensions is to set clear rules that are applied consistently by all supervisors.

- Inclusiveness. Good systems include input from multiple sources on an ongoing basis. First, the evaluation process must represent the concerns of all the people who will be affected by the outcome. Consequently, employees must participate in the process of creating the system by providing input regarding what behaviors or results will be measured and how. This is particularly important in today’s diverse and global organizations including individuals from different cultural backgrounds, which may lead to different views regarding what is performance and how it should be measured.53 Second, input about employee performance should be gathered from the employees themselves before the appraisal meeting.54 In short, all participants must be given a voice in the process of designing and implementing the system. Such inclusive systems are likely to lead to more successful systems including less employee resistance, improved performance, and fewer legal challenges.55
