Criticisms of performance appraisal type processes are not new. Writing in the Harvard Business Review in 1959, Likert observed that: ‘Performance review interviews as a rule are seriously deflating to employees’ sense of importance and self worth. Not only is the conventional review failing to contribute, in many executives’ opinion it can do irreparable harm’. Grint writing more recently (1993) was even more scathing: ‘Rarely in the history of management can a system have promised so much and delivered so little’.

In addition to Likert and Grint, we find plenty of criticisms in other standard performance management texts, such as Armstrong and Ward (2005), Armstrong and Baron (2005) and Fletcher (2001 and 2004). The key criticisms of these writers and others focus on the process design; the execution of the process; and the managers who conduct the process.

(cid:1) Appraisals are expected to meet too many and conflicting objectives. In

particular the evaluative uses of appraisal drive out real conversation and thereby reduce its potential developmental and motivational impact. IES research (Strebler, 2001) points to the problem with performance appraisals with their multiple objectives of setting targets, giving performance feedback, assessing potential, discussing development needs and determining performance-related pay increases. These schemes, therefore, often require a considerable commitment in terms of organisational resources to be implemented. Murphy (2004) equally recognises that in many organisations appraisals are expected to fulfil numerous functions including: feedback, coaching, goal setting, skill development, pay determination, legal documentation, employee comparison and layoff selection and ‘no performance appraisal system can meet all these ends’(Murphy, 2004).
