# Most common leadership structure

First, based on Kogler Hill [38] and Eys et al. [20], we differentiated between task, social, and external leadership. For each of these leadership roles, we analyzed the number of leaders (i.e., players who were endorsed as a leader by at least half of their team members in that specific leadership role), thereby differentiating between zero leaders, one leader, and two or three leaders, where the latter two refer to shared leadership within a specific leadership role. The results of the present study showed clear differences between the teams with respect to their leadership structure.

The most common structure within the teams was to have one task leader, one social leader,

and two external leaders. The results with respect to task and social leadership are in line with earlier findings by Fransen [19]. However, the higher number of external leaders clearly con- trasts with earlier research that reported a lower number of external leaders [8, 19, 20]. An important difference in research design may have accounted for this difference, as the present study relied on a data collection in professional soccer teams, whereas the other studies were
