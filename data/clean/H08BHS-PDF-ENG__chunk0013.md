## Develop Emotional Intelligence and Use Self-Reflection

Emotional intelligence (EQ) is a key diﬀerentiator for leaders, especially

those already successful in their careers. High achievers need mentors

who help them develop a deeper understanding of their own emotions

and those of others. This skill is critical for fostering better relationships

and decision-making, particularly when interacting with people who

have not yet reached the same levels of achievement.

Pro Tip: Establish regular, structured feedback sessions. High achievers

are often left to their own devices as they often don’t need much

oversight. But there is a beneﬁt to having regular check-ins to ensure

the individual is stretching their thinking, not getting complacent, and

thinking several steps ahead.
