# RESULTS

Analysis was conducted in three phases, each of which was composed of varying numbers of employees and companies from the study sample. Although the study population was large when viewed at its broadest level, as the model requirements became more restrictive, the sample size dropped precipitously. This is manifested most clearly in model 3, the participant behavior change model, where only 17,079 employees in 36 different companies provided sufﬁcient data such that an analysis of participant behavior change could be conducted.

The top portion of Table 5 presents the individual-level means and standard deviations for the employees included in each of the three phases of the analysis. In the bottom portion of the table, the same data are presented, but these statistics are based on the aggregate-level summarization of the measures used in the company-level analysis.

For the model that is most inclusive of all employees, the enrollment model, approximately half of all employees included in the study were male. For the different dependent variables in the model, slightly less than one third of all employees enrolled intheprogram.Greaterfemaleparticipationratesweremanifestedin the participation model and the proportion of men enrolled increased in the participant behavior change model. As the models became more restrictive, the average age of the employees steadily increased.

The company-level measures derived from the HERO Score- card are shown in Table 3 and deﬁned in Table 4. There was sub- stantial consistency in the company proﬁles when compared across the different analytical models. The use of incentives to drive par- ticipation in the wellness programs was highly prevalent and nearly all companies provided a cash or better incentive for completing an HA. More than half of companies integrated the incentive into their beneﬁt plan. Use of incentives for lifestyle management was less common, with cash as the most popular option. More than one third of the companies used this strategy to promote participation in the lifestyle management programs, whereas about one in eight companies used a noncash incentive.

Companies tended to offer programs that covered the entire continuum of programs available for wellness initiatives. Nearly two thirds of the companies in this sample offered biometric screening as part of their wellness program. Of seven possible evaluation com- ponents, as assessed in the HERO Scorecard, companies averaged using better than ﬁve of these components. The number of environ- mental supports was slightly lower, averaging about 3 on the 0 to 7scale. The supportiveness of the corporate culture was mid-range, averaging slightly above the mid-point on the 0 to 3 scale, whereas the average score for the wellness champion network index, which was also based on a 0 to 3 scale, was well below the theoretical mid-point.
