As indicated in Figure 6.1, we are not positing that personality traits operate independent of cognition in moderating the linkage among stress, job dissatisfaction, feelings of injustice, and CWBs.

We hypothesize that the chief moderators of the relationship between the perceptual variables and CWBs are Impulsivity, Ex-
