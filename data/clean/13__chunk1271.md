# NOTES

- 1. While there is within culture diversity of conï¬‚ict resolution strategies (Brett, 2001;

Tinsley, 1998, 2001), certain strategies may be more preferred and used more often.

- 2. We do not assume here that these are the only criteria important across cultures. We expect future research may discover new criteria, and that relevance and importance of criteria will vary across cultures.
