## Choosing a Performance Measurement Approach at Paychex, Inc.

The following job description is for an account executive at Paychex, Inc. (www.paychex.com). Paychex, Inc., is a leading national provider of payroll, human resources, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Paychex is headquartered in Rochester, New York, but the company has more than 100 offices and serves hundreds of thousands of clients nationwide. Because account executives often make sales calls individually, their managers do not always directly observe their performance. Furthermore, man- agers are also responsible for sales in their markets and for staying up-to-date on payroll laws. However, account execu- tives are responsible for training new account executives and networking in the industries in which they sell products. For example, if an account manager is responsible for retail

companies, then that account executive is expected to attend retail trade shows and professional meetings to identify potential clients and to stay current with the issues facing the retail industry.
