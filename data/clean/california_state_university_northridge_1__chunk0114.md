terminate an employee who is highly paid to assist in keeping cost down, then as an at-will

employee, they can be discharged. It is important to note that most high earners within

companies are in there 40s; this is when an employee begins reaching their peak earnings.

Termination of high earner could be stated as the justifiable reason, while the intent is to

eliminate older workers. For this approach to be effective, employees who are younger

must be included in discharge, giving the appearance of fairness. Nevertheless, if the

stated sole basis of discharge is monetary strain, and it could be proven, then it is

permissible. If this method of termination is used, it does not mean it is immune :from

lawsuit, but the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff. Many businesses have figured out

this particular loophole and have probably tried this approach with success and failure.

V.'rJle the employer during slov1 economic gro\vth or for the sake of greed v,ants to

maintain or maximize profits, employees are the :first to be discharged, to cut cost. By

diminishing the workforce does not maximize profits, to the extent that new revenue is

generated. Reducing overhead by means of employee's salaries and benefits means that

money can be labeled as profit and or money to boost profits. The average ADEA claim

involves employees who have contributed to the growth of an organization and should not

be discharged for any pretext. At the same time, court cases show that employers are

actively participating in wrongful discharge on the basis of age.

In the area of computers, an employee of Airborne Freight Corp. was awarded

$3.3 million against his employer in 1996. An e~mail message had been mtercepted

between executives which uncovered, the company was potential liable for terminating an

employee on the sole bases of his age. The employee was 46 years of age at the time of

his dismissal. Interception of such a message, exhibits expressly supporting

documentation (irrefutable evidence) those agents of the employer were participating in

discriminator practices. Furthermore, agents of the employer are able to conceptualize

new way of terminating employees, the reason given, is merely a pretext to a form of

discrimination (Mullins, 1999, p. 26). "Jury trials are allowed and the courts can award

back pay, order reinstatement to the job or front pay (which means money the employee

would have earned if he or she were reinstated) order hiring, promotions or job transfer;

assess attorney fees; and award double damages for a willful violation (and most are held

willful)" (Frierson, 1999, p. 15).
