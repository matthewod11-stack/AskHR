## Of the many theories of work motivation, Herzberg's (1966) motivator-hygiene

theory has been one of the most influential in recent decades. Basically, the theory

divides motivating factors into two categories: Motivator factors, which have something

to do with the work itself, and Hygiene factors, which have something to do with the

surrounding context. According to Maslow, most of what we know of human

motivation comes not from psychologists but from psychotherapists treating

patients. He explains that these patients are a great source of error as well as of useful

data, because they constitute a poor sample of the population. The motivational life of

neurotic sufferers should be rejected as a paradigm for healthy motivation. Any theory of

motivation must deal with the highest capacities of the healthy and strong man.
