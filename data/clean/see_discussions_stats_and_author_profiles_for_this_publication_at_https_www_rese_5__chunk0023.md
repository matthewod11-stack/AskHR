Summarily, ENPS has been iden(cid:415)(cid:302)ed to be a cri(cid:415)cal tool which could enhance the measurement

of employee engagement and loyalty within organiza(cid:415)ons. By drawing from founda(cid:415)onal elements

associated with the Net Promoter Score (NPS) framework, the use of the ENPS facilitates the ability

of organiza(cid:415)onal stakeholders in adop(cid:415)ng a useful metric to guide organiza(cid:415)ons in understanding

advocacy and levels of employee sa(cid:415)sfac(cid:415)on in a (cid:302)rm. As a leading workforce engagement

indicator, a high ENPS facilitates organiza(cid:415)ons capabili(cid:415)es in listening to their employees, fostering

responsiveness and con(cid:415)nuous improvement. This is not just useful for promo(cid:415)ng a posi(cid:415)ve work

environment, but for the enhancement of employee loyalty and produc(cid:415)vity. Moreover, being able

to Iden(cid:415)fy and develop organiza(cid:415)onal leaders who are crucial in the execu(cid:415)on of the (cid:302)rms strategy

underscores the strategic value associated with the eNPS.(cid:32)
