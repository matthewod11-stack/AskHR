Employees are entitled to a place to pump, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from

coworkers and the public. The location provided must be functional as a space for pumping. If the space is not dedicated to the nursing employee’s use, it must be available when needed. A space temporarily created or converted into a space for pumping at

work or made available when needed by the nursing employee is su(cid:211)icient provided that the space is shielded from view, and free from any intrusion from coworkers and the public. A bathroom, even if private, is not a permissible location under the Act.

Certain employees of airlines, railroads, and motorcoach carriers are exempt from the pump at work protections of the FLSA. Employees who are exempted may be entitled to break time and/or space protections under State or local laws.

Employers with fewer than 50 employees are not subject to the FLSA pump at work requirements if compliance with the provision would impose an undue hardship (although State or local laws may still apply). Whether compliance would be an undue hardship is

determined by looking at the di(cid:211)iculty or expense of compliance for a specific employer in comparison to the size, financial resources, nature, and structure of the employer’s business. All employees who work for the covered employer, regardless of work

site, are counted when determining whether this exemption may apply.

Reasonable break time to pump is generally not compensable unless otherwise required by Federal, State, or local law. For

instance, the FLSA requires compensation for all hours worked and break time to pump will be considered hours worked if an employee is not completely relieved from duty during the entirety of the break. When employers provide paid breaks, an employee

who uses that break time to pump must be compensated for that break time. Also, in most cases, the FLSA will require that employers may not reduce exempt employees’ salaries to reflect pump breaks.

Employees may have greater protections under State or local worker protection laws. The FLSA does not preempt State or local laws that provide greater protections to employees - for example, providing compensated break time or providing break time

beyond one year a(cid:212)er the child’s birth.
