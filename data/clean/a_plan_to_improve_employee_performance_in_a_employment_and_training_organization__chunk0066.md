# Job Design

Sometimes what appears to be a training problem, which result from a skill or

knowledge deficiency, may actually be a problem with the design of the job. Jobs may

change over time, technology becomes a challenge or the job itself does not live up to

employees ' expectations. Public managers may see how the job itself might be modified

so as to encourage better performance. The following are some key elements of the job

design that can be changed to cause a desired change in employee performance (Adapted

from Nilson, 1990:204-205): 1) specificity of procedure. Are procedures clear and

specific?; 2) Complexity of rules. Make rules simpler, break down complex rules into

smaller understandable parts; 3) Workflow. Observe how work passes through the

organization , does it flow smoothly without obstacles?; 4) Division of Labor. Check

organizational chart and responsibilities of employees in a unit; check productivity

records for employees with similar jobs ; check volume of work and interdependencies

among employees who affect the job. Does a person have too much or too little work?

The way the work is divided among employees in a unit has to change before

productivity can improve.
