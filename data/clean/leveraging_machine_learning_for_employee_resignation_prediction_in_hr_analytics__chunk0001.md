Abstract A major issue in human resource management, employee a(cid:2386)ri- tion prediction o(cid:2646)ers insightful information for corporate decision- making. In this regard, conventional approaches including decision trees have only shown modest success. (cid:2399)ese techniques usually presume feature independence, though, and struggle to (cid:2647)t the re- lationships in the data. Using Graph A(cid:2386)ention Networks (GAT), we present a novel method for estimating employee a(cid:2386)rition that makes use of the linkages and similarities among employees to raise prediction performance. In this study, we represent each employee as a node in a graph, with their personal a(cid:2386)ributes (such as age, salary, job satisfaction, etc.) serving as node features. We build an adjacency matrix based on employee similarity computed with cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. We develop a GAT model using this graph structure that aggregates surrounding node fea- tures based on a(cid:2386)ention-based criteria therefore enabling the model to weigh the signi(cid:2647)cance of various relationships between employ- ees. (cid:2399)e GAT-based model beats conventional logistic regression according to experimental data, therefore greatly enhancing the accuracy of employee a(cid:2386)rition prediction. Improving prediction performance depends critically on the model’s capacity to replicate dependencies between characteristics and include relational infor- mation from adjacent nodes. (cid:2399)is paper shows the possibilities of GAT in employee a(cid:2386)rition prediction and emphasizes its capacity to model complex interactions inside employee data, therefore pro- viding a fresh approach for strategic workforce management and human resource analytics.

1 Introduction Employee a(cid:2386)rition is a concern for organizations as it impacts their (cid:2647)nancial health, knowledge, and team dynamics [1–3]. Each time an employee exits an organization, not only does the organization have to pay for the recruitment and induction of a new employee, but it also loses the experience and knowledge the existing em- ployee carried with them. Additionally, frequent changes in the team members may cause disruption in the established dynamics and processes, impacting productivity and morale. (cid:2399)erefore, or- ganizations, especially HR departments, must foresee and prevent such turnover threats in advance.

In the past, (cid:2647)rms have relied heavily on traditional predictive models, such as decision trees, that rely heavily on the characteris- tics of one individual to forecast a(cid:2386)rition. While some success has been achieved using these models, they cannot identify complex relationships and interdependencies among workers that can have valuable predictive power. (cid:2399)is is because traditional models treat each employee as an isolated entity without considering the rich web of interactions and in(cid:2648)uences in the workplace.
