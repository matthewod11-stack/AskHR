# 258 Psychology of Women and Gender

responsibility takes precedence over self-sufﬁciency (Hare- Mustin & Marecek, 1986).

Feminist critiques have been accompanied by a variety of efforts to change clinical training and practice. In 1977, the Division of Counseling Psychology undertook a 2-year pro- gram of conferences and special issues of The Counseling Psychologist designed to provide information and skills about women and girls and to counter sex bias in therapy and counseling. Around the same time, the APA constituted a Task Force on Sex Bias and Sex Role Stereotyping, which produced and promulgated guidelines for nonsexist therapy (American Psychological Association, 1978). In 1979, the APA and the National Institutes of Mental Health convened an interdisciplinary conference of mental health specialists to identify priorities for clinical research on women. Women and Psychotherapy, the volume resulting from that confer- ence, served as a core text in the area of women and psy- chotherapy for many years (Brodsky & Hare-Mustin, 1980). Feminists “broke the silence” surrounding sexual contact in psychotherapy (Hare-Mustin, 1974). They argued that be- cause of the inevitable power differences in therapy relation- ships, sexual involvement between therapist and client could not be consensual. As a result of pressure by feminist groups, the APA eventually altered its ethical code to include an ex- plicit injunction against sexual contact between therapist and client.
