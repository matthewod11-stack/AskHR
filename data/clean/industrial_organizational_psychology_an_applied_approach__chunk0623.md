Interestingly, all but .% of the gap between men and women can be explained by such factors as men being in the workforce longer, having a higher percentage of full-time jobs, and working more hours in a year (Wall, ). Th us, sex dif- ferences in pay are often less an issue of pay discrimination by organizations than one of vocational choice and educational opportunity discrimination. To alleviate gender diﬀ erences in pay, it is essential that young women be encouraged to enter historically male-dominated ﬁ elds (assembly lines, management, police) and that young men be encouraged to enter historically female-dominated ﬁ elds (nursing, clerical, elementary education). Furthermore, because men are more inclined to negotiate such things as starting salaries than are women (Babcock & Laschever, ; Stuhlmacher & Walters, ), some of the pay gap can be narrowed by not allowing applicants to negotiate salaries. Although a complete discussion on this topic goes beyond the scope of this text, an excellent assortment of articles and links on this issue can be found at http://www.swcollege.com/bef/policy_debates/ gender.html

Conducting a Sex and Race Equity Study Th e ﬁ rst step in conducting a salary equity analysis for an organization is to place jobs into the SSEGs mentioned previously. Th is task takes considerable time as one needs to use salary grades to determine similarity of worth and use job descriptions to determine similarity of duties and responsibilities. To com- ply with OFCCP guidelines, at least % of employees must be in SSEGs large enough to compare salaries using some type of statistical analysis. Th e goal of these analyses is to determine if the average salary for men diﬀ ers signiﬁ cantly from the average salary for women, and whether the average salary for whites diﬀ ers from the average salary for minorities (in salary analyses, all minorities are initially lumped into one group). Th is analysis is conducted for each SSEG, rather than the organization as a whole.

Two types of statistical analyses are typically used: hierarchical regression and Fisher’s exact tests. For smaller SSEGs (fewer than  total employees), a Fisher’s exact test is used to compare median salaries. If there are at least  employees in the SSEG and at least  employees in each sex or race group (i.e.  men and  women), this can be done through a statistical technique called hierarchical regression.

With hierarchical regression, the ﬁ rst step is to enter your merit variables into the equation to determine what percentage of individual diﬀ erences in pay they explain. Th e second step in the equation is to enter sex (coded  for males,  for females) to determine whether, after controlling for the merit variables, an employee’s sex is still related to pay. Th at is, suppose the average salary for men in grade  is $, and for women $,. It may be that this $, dif- ference can be explained by the fact that the average man in the grade has been with the organization ﬁ ve years longer than the average woman in the SSEG. Th e results of the regression will determine if the $, salary diﬀ erence can be fully explained, partially explained, or not explained by diﬀ erences in the merit variables.

If the results of the regression analysis indicate that the merit variables do not explain sex or race diﬀ erences in salary, one still cannot conclude that discrimination has occurred. It could be that there are valid factors involved in
