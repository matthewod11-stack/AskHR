## for the conventional majority — and what a massive opportunity for the

wise minority of business leaders who do.

Who doesn’t want to be recruited lovingly? Or checked into a hotel

lovingly? Or oﬀered ﬁnancial services lovingly? Who wouldn’t want a

loving meal out, a loving ﬂying experience as a passenger, an insurance

claim processed lovingly? We all would. And as the data show, we’d

behave so much more productively if we were given a more loving set

of experiences — employees show higher performance, customers show

more loyalty, and both become advocates for your brand.

The AI locomotive is almost guaranteed to shunt love from our lives.

AI can mimic at great scale, but it will never be committed to helping any one human ﬂourish. AI can, we hope, be deployed eﬃciently and

harmlessly. But since its stance toward us is amoral, it can never be

deployed lovingly.
