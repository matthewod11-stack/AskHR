# Performance Appraisal

"cause," the EEOC w ill again attempt to conciliate the matter. At this point, concilia- tion remedies might include back pay, promotion, changes in procedures and relief for others similarly affected If the investigation reseals "no-reasonable-cause," the EEOC will issue a right-to-sue letter to the complainant. Faced with a finding of "cause," the organization will often elect to settle the case rather than take a chance on losing in court. If conciliation fails, the EEOC has direct access to the courts, and will consider litigation based on the merits of the case. Actually, most charges do not result In litiga- tion but are resolved through administrative action.

If the case goes to court, the complainant (plaintiff) must, as shown earlier, prose a prima facie case of discrimination by showing intent to discriminate. disparate treat- ment, or disparate impact. This is the first burden of proof in a discrimination case and is always carried by the plaintiff.

Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case in a disparate treatment claim, the employer must articulate some legitimate, non discriminatory reason for making the decision. When disparate impact is established, the employ er must shcw that the practice or procedure has a "manifest relationship" to the job in question. This holds even when the criteria are, by necessity, "subjective or discretionary" in nature. The employer may show that the practice is necessary to fill a legitimate business requirement. This is known as the defense of "business necessity." Another defense is to demonstrate that the practice is valid or job-related according to the "Guidelines." There are variants and combinations of these defenses, but the important point to remember is that, once a prima facie case has been established, the employer is presumed to have violated Title VII unless the employer can show otherw ise.8 The second burden of proof (some authorities use the term burden of production) in an EEO case is always carried by the employer.

If the employer's defense is successful, the plaintiff must show that the employer's reasons were, in fact. only a pretext, or that alternate selection methods having less adverse impact are available. This third burden is carried by the plaintiff. EEO cases, however, are normally decided on the basis of whether or not employers can demon- strate that their practices are job-related (see Figure 2.1).

The discussion above outlines how a charge would typically be decided in a court case. Most charges, of course, do not result in actual litigation, but are resolved by the EEOC or state agency through administrative action, either by a "no cause" finding, or, if "reasonable cause" is found, through conciliation.`

An employer who loses a Title VII case is subject to back pay awaids (which can be substantial in a class action suit). Also, courts normally allow the pres ailing party to recover attorney fees. There 'lase been cases where courts hive found defendants to be personally liable for violating the rights of individuals. Finally, a court is likely to impose hiring and promotional quotas, as well as requiring the employer to revise its practices. Even if the employer w insi lawsuit is sexy costly. Time and resources
