# The APA Committee on Women in Psychology

The Committee on Women in Psychology (CWP) began as the task force headed by Helen Astin in 1970; it was accorded status as a continuing committee of the APA in 1973. The committee has worked to increase the visibility of scholar- ship on women and gender, highlight the contributions of women in psychology, end discrimination against women psychologists, and promote leadership by women. More broadly, the committee has worked to promote the psycho- logical well-being of women. The CWP has actively pursued its goals through symposia, conferences, task forces, and li- aisons with government agencies and professional groups. The CWP annually makes awards to women who have been distinguished leaders in psychology.
