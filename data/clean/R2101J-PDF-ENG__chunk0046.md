On average, 28% of senior executives’ variable compensa­ tion is paid the year it’s awarded (or immediately thereafter), and 72% is paid in future years. At the high end of the spec­ trum, technology companies pay 83% of variable comp in long­term awards, health care companies 81%, and telecom companies 80%. At the other end, financial firms pay only 60% of variable compensation in long­term awards.

Long­term compensation generally involves multiple overlapping cycles. Awards earned in 2018 may be payable in 2018, 2019, and 2020, but the executive receiving them may also get payments in 2018 from plans put in place in 2016 and 2017. Some companies, however, choose to make all grants up front (for example, giving three to five years of awards upon hiring or after another significant event without subsequent annual grants).

Companies undergoing a transformation usually empha­

size short­term rather than long­term compensation to encourage fast change. The mix may also reflect other busi­ ness practicalities. Companies with less cash, for example, may focus on long­term compensation.

Business cycles are another factor. A director we talked to

described his experience with designing executive com­ pensation at his company this way: “It’s a long­cycle capital business, and most of the management team’s compensation is three to five years out.” He added that while executive compensation is to some extent set by market practice, the makeup of it should be determined by the company’s strat­ egy. “Is the compensation incenting sustainable long­term behavior that gets the organization where it wants to go, or is it really short­term­oriented?” he said.

Cash versus equity. Our analysis showed that on average

41% of senior executive compensation is paid in cash, and 59% in equity. The mix is often determined by business matu­ rity. Young companies tend to rely a lot on equity to attract and retain key employees if cash is scarce. The percentage of equity compensation is notably higher for large­cap compa­ nies (63%) than for small­cap companies (48%), however. Technology, telecom, health care, and energy companies put the largest percentage of pay in the form of equity.

One director we interviewed noted that equity compensa­ tion encourages executives to think like owners. He detailed two experiences he had—one with a CEO who had a signifi­ cant equity stake in the company, and one with a CEO who
