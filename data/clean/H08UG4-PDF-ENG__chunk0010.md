# in CEO pay.

But our research, which looked at approximately 300,000 individual

compensation ratings across ﬁrms in 62 diﬀerent industries, shows that

employees focused on a diﬀerent part of the disclosure: the surprisingly

low values of median employee pay. Employees already knew their

own personal CEO pay ratio (i.e., the ratio of the CEO’s pay to their

own pay). What they didn’t know, before the pay ratio disclosure, was

that their peers were also earning a lot less than the CEO. Seeing

the median employee pay value gave them a more realistic and lower

reference point for their own pay. We ﬁnd that this eﬀect holds even

when controlling for CEO pay, the ratio itself, ﬁrm characteristics,

and market-wide factors. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the eﬀect strengthens

when employees had less pay information available to them before the

disclosure, conﬁrming our intuition that they were responding to the
