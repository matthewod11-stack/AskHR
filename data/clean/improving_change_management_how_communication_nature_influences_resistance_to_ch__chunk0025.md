# own merit.

Washington and Hacker (2005: 402) have already declared that “while many

studies focus on the factors impacting change, the link between resistance and change

has been only explored to a limited extent”. In a similar vein, Van Dam and Oreg’s

(2008) previously claimed that, in the field of organizational change, “future research

should expand the context characteristics studied”. As an answer to those arguments,

this research is an effort to address the still existing gap in the understanding of the

mechanisms that allow resistance to change - understood as a communicative

expression - to be embraced and positively managed. It seeks to clarify those

mechanisms and contribute towards allowing practitioners to turn a so-called resistant

into an acceptor or an advocate, and so that the desired change outcomes can be

achieved.

Nonetheless, as the literature review on resistance to change has already

indicated, the genuineness or authenticity of the participation process is configured as a

relevant focus of investigation. Change would depend strongly on the ways information

and participation are provided, not on the mere existence or amount of input, either

given or requested (Lawrence, 1954; Powell and Posner, 1978; Stohl and Cheney,

2001; Lewis, 2006: 11). In other words, “it is not sufficient to offer the right structure or

design in order to promote active participation” (Deetz, 1992). Thus, in order to

contribute towards broadening the understanding of communication in relation to

resistance to change, it seems valuable to turn the focus of future research on

communication and change to the very nature of participation. As supported by other
