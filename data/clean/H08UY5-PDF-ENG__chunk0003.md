# HBR / Digital Article / What New CEOs Should Ask Themselves in Their First 100 Days

In the face of those expectations, it’s important to remember that the

ﬁrst 100 days aren’t about having all the answers—they’re about setting

the foundation for long-term success. And while there may be urgent

decisions to make, you want to use this time to ask the right questions

and get clear on where you want to go and how you’ll get there.

From our experience working with hundreds of CEOs, we’ve seen four

themes emerge as top priorities for the ﬁrst 100 days. And we’ve

identiﬁed 17 critical questions new leaders should ask themselves as

they navigate each priority. This list is just the beginning. The real work

is in owning the questions—and your answers.
