lves in Their First 100 Days

- Who has the insight and foresight to shape the vision—and how fast

should we move to stay ahead?

- How are priorities being balanced to deliver results today while driving

# future growth?

# Staying Focused

New CEOs often ﬁnd themselves pulled in multiple directions, reacting

to problems instead of driving their own agenda. It’s easy to lose sight

of what matters most. Staying on course requires making time for your

own work and developing the conﬁdence and respect to help keep the

organization moving forward. To stay grounded and in control, CEOs

# should:

- Choose a few trusted advisors who speak openly and help them stay on

# course.

- Track and balance how much of their time is spent leading vs.

responding. Block time for strategy and focused work to avoid getting

lost in constant meetings and requests.

- Regularly check in on the vision to make sure priorities remain aligned

—and make adjustments quickly when they are not.

- Consider other feedback loops to tap regularly for clear insights; for

## example, luminaries, geopolitical consultants, customers, or employee

listening sessions. Successful CEOs ﬁnd a way to be genuinely open to

feedback and self-reﬂection, conﬁrming they’re addressing the most

# important questions.

One mechanism to conﬁrm they’re hearing direct feedback is establishing a tight-knit executive oﬃce—a group of fewer than ﬁve

## to 10 trusted team members outside the formal leadership team who

have the respect, inﬂuence, and ability to make things happen. Most

importantly, this group is willing to say it like it is to the CEO. A mix

of strategic thinkers and tactical operators, they work to clear obstacles,

keep things moving, engage with the leadership team to surface issues

early and keep momentum strong, all while conﬁrming alignment with

# the CEO’s vision.

To conﬁrm you’re staying focused, ask yourself:

- In which areas can you truly move the business? (As opposed to letting

what’s most visible or urgent capture your attention.)

- How will you plan to listen broadly enough to see the full picture—and

how will you act boldly to shape it?

- How are you managing your time between reacting and leading—and

what needs to shift?

- What are you concerned you might be missing—and who will you trust

to tell you the truth?

. . .

When you step into the CEO role, the pressure to have all the answers

is real. But no one expects you to solve everything overnight. What they

do expect is leadership that tackles the most important questions facing

the business and clear communication about what you’re focused on,

what you’re learning, and where challenges lie.

Taking the time to ask the right questions during your ﬁrst 100 days

can help you build a stronger foundation of trust, alignment, and

excitement to build on when it comes time to execute.

And as you reﬂect, one ﬁnal question is worth asking: Are you showing

up the way you intended—and would your team say the same?
