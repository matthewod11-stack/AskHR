# Case Study Classroom Notes

- 1. In 2020 software-as-a-service start-ups receiving Series D or later VC

funding had a median pre-money valuation of $580 million.

- 2. Are Louis’s concerns about burn rate reasonable in this climate, or is he

fixated on costs because of his past?

- 3. VC funding has dropped, in part because the number of exits declined from 1,925 deals valued at $753 billion in 2021 to 1,208 deals valued at $71 billion in 2022.

- 4. If Tyler sweetens the offer for Chris, should he worry that existing

employees who may not have received such rich deals might learn about it and be upset?

- 5. Data from Crunchbase shows that 9% of the start-ups it tracked did two rounds of layoffs in 2022. In the first quarter of 2023 the tech giants Facebook and Amazon announced second rounds of employee cuts.

- 6. Relying on attrition to cut costs can be slow and unpredictable, but there is an upside: Companies needn’t pay severance or extend benefits to employees who resign.

HBR’s fictionalized case studies present problems faced by leaders in real companies and offer solutions from experts. This one is based on a case prepared by the authors for use in a series of workshops to engage portfolio company CEOs at Thrive Capital.
