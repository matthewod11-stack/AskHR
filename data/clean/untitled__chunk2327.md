WHAT IS SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY?

School psychology is an applied psychology specialty that blends the knowledge bases of education and psychology into a professional practice that delivers services to clients of vari- ous ages, primarily those of school age (preschool to college), in a variety of settings, primarily public and private elemen- tary and secondary schools. School psychology can be further deﬁned along several dimensions, including professional as- sociation deﬁnitions, demographics, training, credentialing, employment characteristics, and services. A career publica- tion states that “school psychologists work directly with pub- lic and private schools. They assess and counsel students, consult with parents and school staff, and conduct behavioral intervention when appropriate” (American Psychological Association, 1998, p. 7). The Division of School Psychology (Division 16) within theAmerican PsychologicalAssociation (APA) describes itself as composed of scientist-practitioner psychologists whose major professional interests lie with children, families, and the schooling process. The National AssociationofSchoolPsychologists(NASP)describesschool psychologists as members of a team with educators, parents, and other mental health professionals who seek to ensure that children learn in safe, healthy, and supportive environments. A broad deﬁnition of school psychology appears in the Peti- tion for Reafﬁrmation (1997).
