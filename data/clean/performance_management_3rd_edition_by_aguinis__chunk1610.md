# Was Robert Eaton a Good Coach?

Robert Eaton was CEO and chairman of Chrysler from 1993 to 1998, replacing Lee Iacocca who retired after serving in this capacity since 1978. Eaton then served as cochairman of the newly merged DaimlerChrysler organization from 1998 to 2000. With 362,100 employees, DaimlerChrysler achieved revenues of EUR 136.4 billion in 2003. DaimlerChrysler’s passenger car brands include Maybach, Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, and Smart.

Furthermore, Eaton and Lutz held meetings with their execu- tive team on a regular basis to exchange ideas and informa- tion from all areas of the organization.

Eaton even reorganized the manner in which Chrysler designed cars based on a study, previously disregarded by Iacocca, that indicated that Chrysler needed to be more flexible and its executives needed to be in constant commu- nication with the product design team. One employee was quoted as saying, “Bob Eaton does not shoot the messenger when he hears something he doesn’t like or understand. He knows that not every idea is right. But Bob is off-the-wall himself. . . . He’ll say something, and we’ll tell him that it’s a crazy idea. . . . He may not change his mind in the end, but he’ll spend the time explaining to you what is behind his thought processes. Do you know what kind of confidence that inspires?” This type of open communication at the top proved extremely successful, as summed up by one designer: “It’s a system that recognizes talent early and
