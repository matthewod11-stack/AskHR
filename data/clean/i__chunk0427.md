# Multiple-Staged Criteria and Variables:

Decision trees are particularly useful when decisions are based on multiple stages, involving

different criteria and variables at each stage. The algorithm iteratively chooses the best features

structure. They are used in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and marketing, where

decisions based on multiple criteria need to be made
