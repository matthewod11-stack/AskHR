## IDENTIFY USE CASES WITH POTENTIAL FOR PILOT SUCCESS

The most suitable project to start with in your business should have the following characteristics:

Well suited to LLM capabilities. It should leverage core LLM strengths – such as processing unstructured data, content classification, or format transformation.

Meaningful and measurable success metrics. Don’t just focus on technical performance. Look for use cases which directly impact key business indicators e.g. reduced processing time, increased throughput, or improved accuracy.

Clear return on investment. Demonstrating concrete ROI builds organizational confidence and supports broader adoption.

Business critical, but low security risk. Your first use case shouldn’t carry extreme operational or security risks. This allows you to establish governance frameworks and build institutional knowledge without putting critical operations at risk.

Abundant data. Do you have enough data to support the use case, and is it in the format needed, with permission to use it?

Minimal disruption to existing processes. Consider parallel deployment—running AI-enhanced processes alongside existing workflows until performance and reliability are proven.

Scalable and duplicable. The knowledge and processes devel- oped will become valuable assets as you scale your AI initiatives.
