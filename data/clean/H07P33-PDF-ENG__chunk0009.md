# on supervisors for guidance.

In addition, the AI platform can facilitate more useful checkpoints

between therapists and their supervisors when they do need to meet.

For example, it can be used to quickly synthesize or extract relevant

client session data when discussing a complex case, reducing reliance

on memory or notes. As one supervisor told Katherine, “New therapists

often have questions … Eleos’ analyses allow me to zero in on key

moments in their session visits, or on techniques the therapists have

used, as well as patient progress over time, so that our coaching time

together can be spent most productively.”
