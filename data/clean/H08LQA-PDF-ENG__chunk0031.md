## HBR / The Big Idea / When Employees Take Sabbaticals, Organizations Benefit

they have suﬃcient time to plan and save. Or companies could oﬀer

full pay for a shorter period of time — say three months — and allow

employees to use unpaid leave or accrued vacation days for the rest.

Obviously, the less ﬁnancial help you oﬀer, the more likely it is that only

privileged employees will be able to take advantage of the policy.

In countries where healthcare is linked to employment, such as

the United States, retaining insurance for your employees is also

nonnegotiable. Although it’s possible for people to buy supplemental

policies for work breaks, having to navigate that system even once can

trigger enough stress to reduce the positive beneﬁts of time oﬀ.

To diﬀerentiate themselves from competitors, companies might also

consider oﬀering coaching to sabbatical-takers. A trained, independent

third party can help them ﬁgure out the details of transferring

work responsibilities and putting the learnings from their time oﬀ

into practice upon return. For example, McKinsey oﬀers coaching to

employees during breaks, and HubSpot gives bonuses that employees

may spend on any kind of career development.

Disconnection. The ﬁnal pillar for a successful sabbatical program is

perhaps the most important: ensuring that those who take time oﬀ

do so for long enough and truly disconnect. You’ll need to establish

a minimum time-oﬀ policy and actually prevent them from working.

This is because habituated patterns can lead to what I call “functional

workaholism,” which requires time and space to recover from.

Most of the people I interviewed said it took them six to eight weeks to

fully disengage from their professional identities and become open to

new experiences and thinking. That’s why three months is the baseline

length for a proper sabbatical, and my team’s survey results indicate it
