## the various budget expenses under the other key stakeholders as

demonstrated above.

Don’t get bogged down by exceptions. Some expenses may straddle

categories or defy easy classiﬁcation, e.g., “insurance.” Does that belong

with employees, customers, or some other stakeholder? If the answer is

unclear then maybe it’s time to break the “insurance” category down for

discussion purposes. Does it relate to accident insurance for employees?

Or is it pertaining to the company’s liability insurance for product

performance, in which case, it belongs with customers? This discussion

will not only clarify issues it may have the reverse eﬀect of redesigning

and clarifying budget expense categories.

I need to stress that this recategorization is only for this exercise. I’m

not suggesting that you tell the accounting department to change their

system. If it works for them, let it be.
