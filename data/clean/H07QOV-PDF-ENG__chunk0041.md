## So here’s another question along those lines from Mohammed in

Pakistan. Employees may be hesitant to oﬀer feedback that could be

perceived as negative, which can impede professional development,

hinder organizational progress. How does one tackle this situation?

AMY EDMONDSON:

Such a good question because it’s true. We are very reluctant to do things, to speak up with negative or diﬃcult information, because

frankly it will always be easier not to. It will always be easier to hold

back than to speak up candidly and forthrightly about something that

you hope could be made better.

The way to make this very diﬃcult thing easier is to set the stage by

pointing out how valuable it is. Periodically, I would say even frequently,

refer to the fact that “We need to do this hard thing. We need to do it

well if we want to be as good as we can as a team.”
