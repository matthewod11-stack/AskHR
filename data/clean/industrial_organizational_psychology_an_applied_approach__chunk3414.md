However, if the supervisor is deciding what he wants for lunch, whether others agree with or have input into the decision is not important (unless, of course, the choices involve onions or garlic).

Probability of Decision Acceptance. The fifth decision-making factor is subordinate acceptance. If the leader feels that he can make the decision himself but that acceptance of the decision is important, he must determine whether his subor- dinates will accept it. If the leader is popular and viewed as being competent, his subordinates will probably accept and follow the decision. But if the leader is not popular, powerful, and competent, he will probably want help from his subordinates and colleagues in making the decision, even though he has the abil- ity to make the decision himself. This is why leaders often ask subordinates and colleagues for their opinions. The leader may already know what he will decide, but gaining the support of others by eliciting opinions and comments increases the chances that they will accept his decision when he announces it.

A colleague told me a story that provides a perfect example of the impor- tance of considering the need for subordinate acceptance. At her university, the graduate college changed the way in which it administered and awarded graduate assistantships. The assistant dean was placed in charge of developing and imple- menting the new system. A week prior to the end of school, the new system was announced, and the graduate faculty went crazy. The awarding of the assistant- ships came too late to recruit students, the new application forms did not provide the information needed by departments to make decisions, and the deadlines for paperwork were convenient for the graduate college but not for the students or the departments.

What went wrong? If we look at the Vroom-Yetton model, two problems stand out. First, the assistant dean did not have the information necessary to make the decision. She had never taught a class, been a graduate student, or been involved in the financial aid process. In spite of this lack of experience and information, she chose not to consult any of the stakeholders (e.g., faculty, department chairs, graduate students) who would be affected by the decisions. Second, although acceptance of her decision was certainly important, she made no attempt to communicate the reasons for her decisions or to work with the departments to increase acceptance. Furthermore, the staff at the graduate col- lege was viewed by faculty as being incompetent, not trustworthy, and making decisions beneficial to the dean’s career but not always in the best interest of the students, faculty, or university as a whole.

Subordinate Trust and Motivation. The sixth factor in the decision-making process is the extent to which subordinates are motivated to achieve the organizational goals and thus can be trusted to make decisions that will help the organization. For example, suppose a marketing survey indicates that a bank will attract more customers if it is open on Saturdays. If the branch manager allows his employees to decide whether the branch should be open on Saturdays, can he trust the employees to make the decision on the basis of what is best for the bank and its customers rather than what is best for the employees? If the answer is no, the branch manager will need to make the unpopular decision after receiving input from his subordinates.

Probability of Subordinate Conflict. The final factor for our consideration in the deci- sion-making process involves the amount of conflict that is likely among the subordinates when various solutions to the problem are considered. If there are many possible solutions and the employees are likely to disagree about which is

best, the leader will be best served by gathering information from employees and then, as in the previous situation, making the decision herself.

Decision-Making Strategies Using the Vroom-Yetton Model Answering the questions in the flowchart shown in Figure . will lead to one of five possible decision-making strategies: Autocratic I, Autocratic II, Consultative I, Consultative II, or Group I.

With the Autocratic I strategy, leaders use the available information to make the decision without consulting their subordinates. This is an effective strategy when the leader has the necessary information and when acceptance by the group either is not important or is likely to occur regardless of the decision.

With the Autocratic II strategy, leaders obtain the necessary information from their subordinates and then make their own decisions. The leader may or may not tell the subordinates about the nature of the problem. The purpose of this strategy is for leaders to obtain information they need to make a decision even though acceptance of the solution by the group is not important.

Leaders using the Consultative I strategy share the problem on an individ- ual basis with some or all of their subordinates. After receiving their input, the leader makes a decision that may or may not be consistent with the thinking of the group. This strategy is especially useful in situations in which it is important for the group to accept the decision but in which the group members may not agree regarding the best decision.

Leaders using the Consultative II strategy share the problems with their subordinates as a group. After receiving the group’s input, the leader makes a decision that may or may not be acceptable to the group. The main difference between this strategy and the Consultative I strategy is that with Consultative II the entire group is involved, whereas in Consultative I only a few employees are asked to provide input. This strategy is used when acceptance of the decision by the group is important and when the individual group members are likely to agree with one another about the best solution.

With the Group I strategy, the leader shares the problem with the group and lets the group reach a solution. The role of the leader is merely to assist in the decision-making process. This strategy is effective when group acceptance of the decision is important and when the group can be trusted to arrive at a decision that is consistent with the goals of the organization.

Although relatively little research has been conducted on the Vroom-Yetton model, the results of a few studies have been encouraging. For example, Field and House () and Jago and Vroom () found that managers who used the decision-making strategy recommended by the model made better-quality deci- sions than managers who used decision-making strategies that the model would not have recommended. Similar results were found by Brown and Finstuen () with military officers and Paul and Ebadi () with sales managers.
