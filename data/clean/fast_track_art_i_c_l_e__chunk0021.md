Data from 62 companies were pooled representing 645,115 employees fromvariousindustries.Toreducethelikelihoodthatdata were captured as part of a small company pilot program, companies were removed from the initial study pool if fewer than 50 individuals from the company completed an HA or if essential questions on the HERO Scorecard were missing. Individuals were removed from this initial study pool if they were not aged 18 to 80 years or were missing a baseline HA. These exclusion criteria resulted in a baseline study pool of 392,773 individuals from 56 companies (see Table 1).

From the baseline study pool, additional exclusion criteria were applied as appropriate to each of the three dependent variables. For the coaching enrollment analyses, individuals must have been identiﬁed as being eligible for a targeted coaching program on the basis of the results of the baseline HA and they must have enrolled in the coaching program within 150 days of their baseline HA. The ﬁnal sample for these analyses was 205,672 employees representing 55 companies.
