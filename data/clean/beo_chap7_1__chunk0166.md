Similarly, the individual employee in an organization may display biases from

which the organization can extract rents. For example, Oyer and Schaefer (2005)

analyze why firms give options to medium- or lower-level employees. Given the rel-

atively small size of these grants and the risk premia associated with them, options

are unlikely to be an efficient way to provide incentives for these employees. Option

grants may, however, allow firms to attract and retain employees. The analysis of

Oyer and Schaefer suggests that the benefits of option compensation are partic-

ularly high if employees are overly optimistic about the future prospects of the

company. Making options part of the compensation package allows firms to iden-

tify those (potential) employees who have particularly strong beliefs about the future

prospects of the company and to reap the rents from compensating them with over-

valued options rather than cash. Such a compensation strategy is profitable if these

employees are also more productive, for instance, due to their enthusiasm about the company.*?

Other elements of organizational design have similar properties. Lazear and Rosen

(1981) have shown conditions under which tournaments dominate other forms of

30As pointed out by Bergman and Jenter (2004), overoptimism about the prospects of the company

by itself is not sufficient to explain options as part of the employment contract. Individuals with such

beliefs can be compensated equally cheaply in cash—their reservation wage will be lower due to the

overvaluation of company stock and options which they can buy with that cash. Or, they may not even

work for the company and just buy the stock or options of the company. These constraints, however,

do not bite if markets are incomplete. For example, the typical ten-year employee option on a public

company’s stock is not traded on a public exchange, and even shorter-duration options are not traded for

private companies. Employees may also not be able to value options based on observed market prices, In

these cases, options may be part of a profit-maximizing compensation contract design, even if employees

with optimistic beliefs about a company do not have higher abilities.
