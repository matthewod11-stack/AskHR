Speciﬁcally, the data showed that parents who experienced more

autonomy on the job and who had more-supportive supervisors and

coworkers were in turn warmer and more engaged when interacting

with their infants. And this has major, long-term implications for those

infants’ development, as a vast body of research has shown that warm

and responsive parenting in a child’s ﬁrst year of life boosts their level

of attachment with their parents as well as their emotional regulation,

social skills, and academic achievement. Indeed, when we checked back

in with these families years later, we consistently saw that the children

of employees who had had more-positive work experiences in their ﬁrst

years as parents had better reading and math skills, better social skills,

and fewer behavioral problems in the ﬁrst grade. Importantly, all of

these results held for both mothers and fathers: Any parent’s experience

in the workplace had a direct and measurable impact on their kids’
