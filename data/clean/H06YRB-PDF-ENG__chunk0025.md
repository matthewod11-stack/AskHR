# Acknowledgement

As I discuss in my book, The Empathetic Workplace, an important

aspect of a trauma-informed approach is the willingness to listen to and

acknowledge the pain of those experiencing trauma. Sharing a story of

trauma can be healing, mentally and even physically. It isn’t enough

merely to allow people to share their experiences, though; they need

to feel genuinely heard as well. An acknowledgement can be as simple

as a manager saying to an employee whose spouse is dying, “Thanks

for letting me know. I’m sorry for all you’re going through,” or an

office-wide communication that addresses a community trauma. The

key is that an acknowledgment neither denies the experience of those

suffering (“It will all work out for the best”) nor distracts from it (“Let

me tell you how I persevered through something similar”). When we fail

to acknowledge the pain that someone is experiencing, we can veer into

toxic positivity or even gaslighting.
