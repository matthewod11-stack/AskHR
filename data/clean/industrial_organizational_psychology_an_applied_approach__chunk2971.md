Identify and acknowledge the skills you lack. Successful leaders are willing to acknowledge their weaknesses and then do what it takes to improve. If you aren’t sure how strong your skills are, ask someone you trust and who you know will be honest, to tell you. Many colleges provide guest speakers on leader- ship or provide leadership workshops. Learn when these trainings will be scheduled and make it a point to enroll. Get a part-time job in an organization such as McDonald’s, where you can quickly advance to a supervisory role. Being a lifeguard may be more

fun, but getting job-related leadership experience will be much more beneficial.
