# 3.1 Identifying pivotal talent positions

We argue that the identification of pivotal talent positions should be the first stage

in any strategic talent management system. As noted above, while an influential stream of

talent management literature emphasises the identification of ‘A performers’ and focuses

9

on their retention and development (Axelrod et al., 2002; Frank et al., 2004; Michaels et

al., 2001) an emerging literature base advocates a focus on the identification of key

positions (Boudreau and Ramstad, 2005; 2007) or “A positions” (Huselid et al., 2005)

which have the potential to differentially impact on sustainable competitive advantage.

Some strategic HRM (SHRM) scholars (c.f. Lepak and Snell, 1999), adopt a

bottom up focus in their theory development emphasising the idea that employees can

contribute to the firm’s strategic objective simply because of their value and uniqueness

(Becker and Huselid 2006). In contrast, Becker and Huselid (2006: 904) advocate a top-

down focus arguing that “When employees are able to contribute to a firm’s strategic

objectives they have (strategic) value” and that “…not all strategic processes will be

highly dependent on human capital”. Thus, they recognise that the locus of

differentiation, in terms of fit, should be the job not the individual employee. Huselid et

al. (2005: 2) define these “A positions” by their “disproportionate importance to a

company’s ability to execute some parts of its strategy and second…the wide variability

in the quality of the work displayed among the employees in these positions”. While the

organisation’s strategic human capital is encompassed in the employees of the

organisation, to whom we return below, it is the organisational systems and processes

which create and manage this strategic human capital and ensure that its contribution is

maximised. Human capital is of little economic value unless it is deployed in the

implementation of the organisation’s strategic intent (Becker and Huselid, 2006; Boxall
