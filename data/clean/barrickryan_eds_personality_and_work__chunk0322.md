# 100 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Conscientiousness. The contextual knowledge measure was a situa- tional interview designed to assess the participants’ knowledge of ap- propriate customer service behaviors, and the job performance measure was supervisor ratings of the participants’ customer service– related job performance. Schmit et al. found that contextual knowledge mediated the personality-contextual job performance relationship in the case of Extraversion. These results are some- what difﬁcult to interpret because customer service is probably a combination of task and contextual performance.

Schneider and Johnson (2001) used a situational judgment test as a measure of contextual knowledge for the dimensions of per- sonal support and conscientious initiative. Predictors were agree- ableness, achievement, dependability, and cognitive ability. Criteria were supervisor ratings of personal support, conscientious initiative, and customer service performance. The contextual knowledge me- diation hypothesis was tested separately for each construct, and sup- port was mixed. Conscientious initiative knowledge did not mediate the relationship between achievement and conscientious initiative performance. When testing the relationship between agreeableness and personal support performance, a model in which personal support knowledge mediated the relationship ﬁt equally as well as a model in which there was no mediation. For customer service, the mediation effect was found for achievement but not for de- pendability or agreeableness.

Schneider and Johnson (2003) tested a more complete version of the Motowidlo et al. (1997) model in a sample of employees in customer contact positions in a large company. The criteria were supervisor ratings of customer service task performance, conscien- tious initiative, and personal support. Task and contextual knowl- edge were measured with a situational judgment test. The indirect determinants were cognitive ability, agreeableness, and achieve- ment. The Motowidlo et al. model was not supported; there were no mediation effects of task or contextual knowledge. Support was found for an alternative model that involved two changes from the original model. First, a direct path was added from achievement to task knowledge, because people higher on achievement should tend to acquire more task-relevant knowledge. The second change was to make conscientious initiative a mediating variable between achievement and the dimensions of personal support and task per-
