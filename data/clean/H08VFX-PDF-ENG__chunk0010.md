## HBR / Digital Article / How to Respond When a Big Decision Provokes Backlash

At ﬁrst, Rick took the department heads’ concerns as a referendum

on his leadership, spending meeting after meeting defending his

credentials and explaining his rationale. But putting their reactions

into context helped Rick develop more compassion and cooled his own

defensiveness. He realized that the public works director was wrestling

with losing the inﬂuence he’d held for 15 years. The planning manager

was processing the reality that her gatekeeping role was about to

diminish. Rick could also more rationally explore whether his plan was

sound or if their feedback contained valid concerns worth addressing.

Acknowledge the discomfort without apologizing.

You can validate someone’s experience and not backtrack on moving

the organization toward its goals. Try statements like these to show that

you’re listening without signaling that you’re open to reversing course:

- I understand that this shifts how you’ve been operating and that’s

hard. I’m committed to supporting you.

- This changes how we work with the client. I recognize that and I

appreciate us working through it together.

- It’s a new process and is deﬁnitely more involved than what you’re

used to. Help me understand where you’re getting stuck.

Notice that you are not apologizing for any mistake or inconvenience,

nor are you agreeing that you may have moved too fast. Instead,

showing that you empathize with the impact while making it clear the

decision still stands and isn’t up for debate.
