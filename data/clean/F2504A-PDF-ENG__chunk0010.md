companies must address two critical questions: What do we automate

and who are we beneﬁting?

Determine what to automate. Although the GitHub Copilot example

focuses solely on coders and their managers, any company can use

gen AI to free middle managers from their traditional tasks. The key is

determining which tasks are ripe for automation and which should be

conducted manually.

But before you decide which tasks to automate, Hoﬀmann recommends

doing what his team did when they started the GitHub study. They

cataloged every task they observed as either a project management task

or a coding task. Any company, no matter the product or industry, can

audit their tasks in this manner. Once you’re done, you’ll be able to

rethink which tasks could shift from middle managers to gen AI.

During the study, Hoﬀmann and his team observed a distinction

between coders who used gen AI and those who didn’t. The gen AI
