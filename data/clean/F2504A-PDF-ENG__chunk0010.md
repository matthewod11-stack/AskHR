## HBR / Magazine Article / How AI Is Redefining Managerial Roles

group was less likely to ask managers or peers for help. That’s not all.

For nearly all activities, in both core work and project management,

developers who used Copilot worked in smaller groups than those who

didn’t. A similar experiment can beneﬁt most companies. Observe how

your team uses gen AI and ﬁnd areas where it can increase autonomy.

“Gen AI can, in some instances, replace a manager, mentor, or any other

individual that junior employees may ask for help,” Hoﬀmann says.

“Managers don’t always have time for people. And their teams don’t

always have the bandwidth to meet in very large groups. But with gen

AI, people can ﬁgure things out by themselves without the need for that

extra layer of management.”

Determine who beneﬁts the most. Hoﬀmann’s team made another

critical observation: Coders who were less skilled than their peers

beneﬁted more from gen AI. This occurred partly because they were

more likely to conduct coding activities and less likely to conduct

project management activities than high-ability developers were. Past

research has shown that people tend to trust their own knowledge and

experience more than an AI system’s. In other words, the less you know

about a topic, the more likely you are to rely on AI’s expertise.

Hoﬀmann views this as a major opportunity for companies to relieve

middle managers from the burden of having to upskill low performers,

among other beneﬁts. Because low performers can now use gen AI to

instantly learn and improve on their own, managers can focus their

time on more-important, hands-on work. This represents hours saved

for each manager for each low-performing individual. It also represents

added hours of productivity for everyone involved. This information

can help middle managers better understand their employees’ strengths

and weaknesses. Do low performers understand what work they need

to do and the quality that is expected, for example? What knowledge
