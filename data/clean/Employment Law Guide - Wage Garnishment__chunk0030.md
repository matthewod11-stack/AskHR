# Penalties/Sanctions

Violations of Title III may result in the reinstatement of a discharged employee, payment of back wages, and

restoration of improperly garnished amounts. Where violations cannot be resolved through informal means,

the Department of Labor may initiate court action to restrain violators and remedy violations. Employers who

willfully violate the law's prohibition against termination may be prosecuted criminally and ﬁned, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.

If a state wage garnishment law diﬀers from Title III, the employer must observe the law resulting in the smaller

garnishment and must observe any law prohibiting the discharge of an employee because his or her earnings have been subject to garnishment for more than one debt.
