## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

why is that the way we are built, we are drawn to spontaneously build

relationships with people who are like us and with whom we bump into on a regular basis because their oﬃce is next door.

The way I summarize it is the mechanisms are similarity and proximity.

That’s what builds our networks. We’re narcissistic and lazy. We like

people like us. It’s easier to talk to them, and since we don’t have a lot of

time, we’re going to get to know the people who are easy to get to know

because they’re next door.

That means our networks are insular. They’re not good. They don’t help

us get new jobs. They don’t help us step up to bigger roles.

We’ve got to work on it, but working on it is really aversive too, and

you’ve published some great research on how that works. It makes us

feel a little bit dirty, a little bit disingenuous, a little bit utilitarian, using

people when we approach building relationships in a more strategic

way. It gets in the way of our sense of meritocracy. It gets in the way of

our sense of self-reliance, but we know from my research and that lots

of other people are vital for getting jobs, changing careers, and being

eﬀective and innovative as a leader in the roles which you have already.
