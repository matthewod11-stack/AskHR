# Part II • System Implementation

all or most of the important questions, the fact that the information has been made available does not necessarily mean the communication plan will be successful in gaining acceptance. This is because people have cognitive biases that affect what infor- mation is taken in and how it is processed. Specifically, there are three types of biases that affect the effectiveness of a communication plan, regardless of how well it has been implemented. These are selective exposure, selective perception, and selective retention.

First, selection exposure is a tendency to expose our minds only to ideas with which we already agree. Those employees who already agree that performance management is a good idea may become involved in the communication plan activities, including reading about the system and attending meetings describing how the system works. On the other hand, those who do not see much value in performance management may choose not to read information about it and not to attend meetings related to performance management. Second, selective perception is a tendency to perceive a piece of information as meaning what we would like it to mean even though the information, as intended by the communi- cator, may mean the exact opposite. Someone who believes performance management is about only rewards and punishments may incorrectly interpret that receiving formal performance feedback at the end of each quarter translates into receiving a pay increase or a bonus. Third, selective retention is a tendency to remember only those pieces of informa- tion with which we already agree. If an employee perceives his employer as vindictive, that employee is not likely to remember information about how the appeals process works or about other fair and equitable aspects of the system.

Selective exposure, selective perception, and selective retention biases are pervasive and could easily render the communication plan ineffective. Fortunately, there are several ways to minimize the negative impact of these biases and, therefore, help gain support for the system. Consider the following:4

- Involve employees.

Involve employees in the design of the system. People support what they help create. The higher the level of participation is in designing the system, the greater the support for the system will be.5

- Understand employee needs. Understand the needs of the employees, and identify ways in which these needs can be met through performance management. Basically, provide a personal, clear, and convincing answer to the “What’s in it for me?” question.

- Strike first. Create a positive attitude toward the new performance system before any negative attitudes and rumors are created. Make communications realistic, and do not set up expectations you cannot deliver. Discuss some of the arguments that might be used against the system, and provide evidence to counter them. • Provide facts and consequences. Because of the employee biases, facts do not neces- sarily speak for themselves. Clearly explain facts about the system, and explain what they mean or what the consequences are. Don’t let users draw their own conclusions because they may differ from yours.

- Put it in writing.

In Western cultures, written communications are usually more powerful and credible than spoken communications because they can be carefully examined and challenged for accuracy. Create documentation, which can be made available online, describing the system.

- Use multiple channels of communication. Use multiple methods of communication, including meetings, e-mail, and paper communication. In other words, allow
