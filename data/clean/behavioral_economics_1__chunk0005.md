# rationality limits.

In one sense, behavioral economics is the inevitable result of relaxing the assumption of perfect

rationality. Like perfect competition and perfect information, the assumption of perfect agent rationality is a

useful limiting case in economic theory. Generalizing those assumptions to account for imperfect competition

and costly information was challenging, slow, and proved to be powerful; weakening the assumption of perfect

rationality will be too.

One property of models of human rationality, which largely distinguishes them from studies of

economic competition, is that other social sciences have cumulated a lot of ideas and empirical facts about

human rationality. The approach to behavioral economics that I will describe chooses to pay careful attention to

those constructs and facts. In this empirically-driven approach to behavioral economics, assumptions are chosen

to fit what is known from other sciences. This approach can be thought of as scientifically humble, or it can be
