# Method

Along with our deductive approach to theory, the following sub-sections confirm our ontological (objectivist) and epistemological (positivist) worldview.

Sampling and participants

Data from 601 employees from Aotearoa New Zealand was collected via a QualtricsXM panel, where participants receive compensation and remain anonymous. Prior research supports panels as effective sampling methods (e.g. Haar et al., 2022). The participants in our study were all 18 years or older, engaged in paid employment across three sectors and 20 industries. They worked for organisations of varying sizes, ranging from fewer than ten employees to over 1,000.
