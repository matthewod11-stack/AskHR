- 5. Key Factors Contributing to Disparities in Enforcement The information above shows that the inequality of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) coverage all over the United States can be defined by the complex network of work of the legislative sphere, institutional, economic, and sociocultural aspects. Despite the uniformity of the ADA in legal practice across the country, the real-life enforcement of the regulation differs widely based on the local state of affairs (Kumari, n.d). This section pinpoints and comments on five main factors that contribute to these disparities. 5.1 State-Level Policy Support and Funding State governments are important in augmenting and supplementing federal disability rights laws. ADA compliance is better where state legislatures introduce at least some extra protections or provide enough resources to enforce guidelines. States such as California and Massachusetts have enacted legislation that extends to the ADA and allocates funds to the enforcement of the law at the state level, and assists in training state employers and companies. On the contrary, where a state does not receive much legislative support or where the regulatory philosophy is conservative, not much may be done to support federal mandates (Owen, 2024). The lack of specialization of organizations, or the lack of funding of such organizations that exist, which are the human rights commission, degrades the capacity to keep track of violations Â©2025, Cognizance Journal, ZAIN Publications, Fridhemsgatan 62, 112 46, Stockholm, Sweden, All Rights Reserved 218
