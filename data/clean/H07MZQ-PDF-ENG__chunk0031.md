## about what a parent of a neurodivergent child experiences and maintain

an open mind. Trainings can help. Some parents, of course, may not

want to share more, and that has to be respected; in many cases, they

are still trying to process it themselves.

Supporting charitable organizations is also a nice side eﬀort, but

be sure to avoid problematic organizations such as Autism Speaks*.

When considering nonproﬁts that support neurodivergent people, look

more closely at how they advocate for their target group. Do they

include these persons in their leadership and decision-making? Do they

promote fear or understanding? Aligning with organizations that are

problematic can send the same message as doing nothing at all. In fact,

it can sometimes do more damage.

. . .

Supporting parents of neurodivergent children is diﬀerent from support

systems companies are used to, but it’s not a huge lift. These

parents have extremely valuable skills that only appreciate over time.

Supporting them is both a moral and economic imperative, especially as

more employees begin to acknowledge and identify with neurodiversity.

As always, listening to your employees with diﬀerent backgrounds,

integrating their feedback and experiences, and continuing to evolve

the organization will certainly and immensely beneﬁt it and society

overall. And if these conversations get challenging, you can be sure that

parents like us can handle it.
