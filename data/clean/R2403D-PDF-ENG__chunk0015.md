## problematic dependence on outside talent over time—and how can she

make sure her own employees’ skills don’t atrophy?

Marta is also concerned about her ability to manage freelancers without

the formal authority over employees that is traditionally invested in

company managers. She recognizes that managing freelance workers

will require a diﬀerent set of skills; they’re specialists, after all, and

she’ll need to evaluate them strictly on project deliverables, rather than

on their contribution to overall performance. She also knows that she

can’t rely on the (often unspoken) leverage of pay increases or enhanced

career opportunities to motivate them and manage their performance.
