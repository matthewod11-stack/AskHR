# Recordkeeping

Every labor organization subject to the LMRDA, the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), or the Foreign Service

Act (FSA) must ﬁle a ﬁnancial report (Form LM-2, LM-3, or LM-4) each year with OLMS, and the underlying

records must be maintained. The recordkeeping requirements for each ﬁnancial report, as well as other

required reports, are explained below. For each of these reports, the underlying records must be kept for at

least ﬁve years after the date the report is ﬁled. Any record necessary to verify, explain, or clarify the report must be retained, including, but not limited to, vouchers, worksheets, receipts, and applicable resolutions, and

any electronic documents, including recordkeeping software, used to complete, read, and ﬁle the report.
