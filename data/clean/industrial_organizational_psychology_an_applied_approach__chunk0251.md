In his spare time, Mike likes to make lame attempts at being athletic, cook what at times turn out to be edible meals, travel, and SCUBA dive. He lives in Pulaski, Virginia, with his wife, Bobbie; three neurotic dogs (Gretchen, Ally, and Sydney); and a three-legged cat named Ilean. Mike’s and Bobbie’s son Josh is an attorney in Northern Virginia, but they continue to love him anyway.
