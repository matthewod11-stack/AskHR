Focus RTO strategies on tasks and the types of relationships you want to build

Now that you have seen the relational potential in your virtual business

practices, you can rethink your RTO plans. We suggest that there are two

questions to ask yourself:

- 1. Does the work need in-person interaction? Given that our research

shows that working remotely can beneﬁt coworker relationships,

the narrative that bringing people back to the oﬃce to beneﬁt

relationships does not tell the full story. Instead of focusing your

RTO strategy on the people side of bringing people back together

in person, focus your strategy on the work itself. What would

interactions between employees look like to best support the work

that needs to be done? If it is a brainstorming session that requires

liveliness that you think can only be captured in-person, then perhaps

you want to bring people together in-person to create that spark. If

it is a working session that requires everyone to be on their laptops,

that task may be better done remotely. The last thing you want is

employees commuting into the oﬃce to spend their day logging into

video meetings with colleagues just down the hall. It is important

to recognize that not all tasks require in-person collaboration, and

that working-from-home can provide beneﬁts that being in the oﬃce

simply cannot provide, for both coworker relationships and beyond.

Our main point is that your return-to-work strategy should center on

how your employees relate to each other in terms of what is best for
