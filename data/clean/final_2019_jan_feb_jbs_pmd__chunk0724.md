**. “Correlation was significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).” *. “Correlation was significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed).”

- 1. Supervisors Transformational Leadership style with subordinates Task Performance: From the above table 1.3, results show a significant positive relationship between TP and TFLS, r=0.375, p- 0.000< 0.05, with moderate levels of task performance associated with TFL”.

- 2. Supervisors Transactional Leadership with subordinates Task Performance: From the above table 1.3, results show A significant positive relationship was found between TP and TSLS, r = 0.360, p-0.000 < 0.05, with moderate levels of task performance associated with Transactional Leadership”.

- 3. Supervisors Laissez-Faire Leadership with subordinates Task Performance: From the above table 1.3, results show a non-significant relationship was found between TP and LFLS, r = 0.000, as p-0.995> 0.05, with zero levels of task performance association with Laissez-Faire leadership, task performancehad no significant relationship with Laissez-Faire”.Thus, this shows that among all three styles it was a transformational style, which depictsthe highest correlation and then the transactional style also found to be positively related to employees’ task-related work. Means if leaders focused on employee’s individual need and aspiration, with the idealized attribute, intellectual stimulation, and motivation along with contingent rewards, then the follower’s task performance got enhance more.

Objective: 4: “To evaluate the degree to which leadership styles impact employees’ Task performance in banks.” To test this Hypothesis multi regression was run on data

H03 “There was no significant impact of superior’s leadership style on Task performance of the employee’s in banks.”

The table below 4.1.1 showed the model of regression with three (transactional, transformational and laissez- faire leadership style) independent variables, which explicates 16.4 % of the variance in followers task performance. further, we found that the adjusted R2 indicates “no over-fitting of the model & that the outcomes had better be generalizable from the viewpoint of the ratio of observations to variables in the equation”. Here, the standard error of estimate had been abridged to 0.63293.

Further, in the table 4.1.2, the result of the F statistic found with a degree of freedom of 3 and 418, where the considered F value i.e. 27.304 was far above 1.00 (α = 0.05), which specified that in totally the regression was extremely significant. We approached the identical inference by observing the value of p was 0.000, as this prob value was below the significant level of α = 0.05, this concludes that the regression as a whole was significant.” F (3, 418) = 27.304, p = .000, R2 = .164, suggesting that the leadership subscales factors do significantly predict task performance among bank employees.
