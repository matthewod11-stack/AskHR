## R.E. Lewis, R.J. Heckman / Human Resource Management Review 16 (2006) 139–154

Given this state of affairs in the practitioner literature, it is distressing that talent management does not appear to be a term with currency in the academic literature. A search on the term “talent management” using the PSYCINFO™ database returned no hits. Our aim, of course, is not to criticize a focus on talent or to suggest that talent is not important. Instead we simply point out that TM, as defined currently, is not well grounded in research, not distinct from traditional HR practices or disciplines, and is supported mainly by anecdote.

- 3. Grounding TM in research

Although the term “talent management” does not appear in the peer-reviewed literature there is a significant body of research that has examined the link between HR investments and practices and organizational outcomes. The benefits of these linkages have been empirically demonstrated in a line of research that is well established and highly regarded (Gerhart, 2005). This field is broadly known as strategic human resource management.

Strong human resource practices have been systematically associated with personnel measures (e.g. turnover) as well as organizational performance as measured with objective (Huselid, 1995) and subjective criteria (Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Singh, 2004). These findings have been replicated within industry (Delery & Doty, 1996), across industries (Guthrie, 2001), and at several organizational levels of analysis (MacDuffie, 1995; Youndt, Snell, Dean, & Lepak, 1996). Terpstra and Rozell (1993) found an association between a firm's adoption of staffing practices and profit but also found the strength of the relationship varied across industries. In general, this research demonstrates the value of high quality HR practices and has outlined how that relationship can vary depending on the business or people strategies adopted by the firm and its environment or technical complexity (Lepak & Snell, 2002; Lepak, Takeuchi, & Snell, 2003). From this work has sprung models that attempt to integrate strategy, HR practices, and talent (Lepak, Marrone, & Takeuchi, 2004).

Despite the impressive nature of these results, issues remain. Many of these studies are based on cross-sectional and retrospective designs and thus do not address whether HR practices lead to organizational outcomes or organizational outcomes provide the resources to invest in HR practices (Gerhart, 2005; Wright, Gardner, Moynihan, & Allen, 2005). Many measures are one-source self-reports that make it difficult to specify magnitude of the HR practice/outcome relationship (Gerhart, Wright, & McMahan, 2002; Gerhart, Wright, McMahan, & Snell, 2000; Huselid & Becker, 2000) and there is controversy regarding the organizational level at which HR effectiveness criterion data should be collected (Gerhart et al., 2002, 2000; Huselid & Becker, 2000). Even when these issues are addressed, the temporal stability of both HR practices and firm outcomes as well as issues associated with omitted variables (e.g. management depth) make it difficult to draw causal inferences (Wright, Gardner, & Moynihan, 2003; Wright et al., 2005).

Finally, and most significantly, studies of HR practices have not explicitly investigated how the choice of practices is tied to strategy. Instead, they have simply measured the extent to which practices have varied by industry. As noted by Wright et al. (2005), variation in HR practices may reflect differences in competitive climates, geographical regions, and socio-economic variables. We believe this to be a significant flaw in establishing TM as a strategic and value-added term for if practicing TM, broadly defined, is simply responding to strategic or environmental demands with high quality HR practices that produce business results then the term TM, once again, fails to add incrementally to our current understanding of how a highly functioning HR department operates.

- 4. Making TM strategic

Consider the following question, If you were to begin the process of constructing a building how would you go about it? Would you assemble a group of the best professionals in each necessary craft (plumbing, electrical systems, carpentry, etc.) and let them define your building? Or, would you start with an analysis of the relationship between “construction practices” and some outcome you hope to achieve (building longevity or cost of operation)? Probably not. You probably would first meet with an architect to begin drawing a blueprint after considering a series of key questions such as, what do you hope to accomplish with this building? Will those goals appeal to the intended customers (tenants or shoppers)? What alternatives for orienting the building on its site best accomplish its purpose?

We believe the “TM as architecture” analogy best describes the vision of early proponents of managing talent (Jackson & Schuler, 1990; Walker, 1980) and offers a systems-level, strategic perspective that makes the TM concept one that adds value and opens new research possibilities. Although other authors have noted the need for TM to adopt a
