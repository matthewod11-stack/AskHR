DEB LIU:

I actually was able to pull my mother-in-law’s immigration papers,

actually her immigration card. And I showed it to her, and I found the

record that was the attestation of her good character. And I showed it

to her and she said, “Oh…” My husband saw it and he goes, “Oh, that’s

Aunt Mary from church.” And so just to see that kind of the story. They

never told me the story of how they came to America and how she got

her green card, and how she stayed in America. And so it just opened

up that conversation and that’s why we’re here. It’s not just, you have

this record. It’s the story behind the record. It’s actually the story of a

person who left her home with almost nothing and came to America to

go to college not knowing how she was going to go back. And the life

that she’s unfolded here.
