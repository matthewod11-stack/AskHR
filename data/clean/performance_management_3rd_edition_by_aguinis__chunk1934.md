## Team-Based Rewards for the State of Georgia

In 2001 the state of Georgia’s Department of Human Resources (DHR) updated its performance management sys- tem. The performance management process is used for all employees who are to receive performance evaluations. The following outlines the basic process of this system:

- Manager training. Prior to utilizing the system, all managers receive training on how the system works and how to implement each phase of the system.

- Performance planning. This is the first step of the performance management system process and is used to create the employee’s performance plan. Developing a performance plan involves identifying job and individual responsibilities and performance expectations. It is the primary responsibility of the manager to develop this plan using input from the employee that he or she may want included in the performance plan.

- Salary increase. Salary increases are awarded annu- ally to each eligible employee. To be eligible for a per- formance-based salary increase, employees must:

- Receive an overall rating for Job and Individual Responsibilities of at least “met expectations.” • Receive an overall rating for Terms and Conditions of Employment of at least “needs improvement.” • Salary increases for each evaluation period for employees who “met or exceeded expectations” are restricted to the following guidelines:

- An overall rating of “met expectations” will receive a standard increase, based on the amount identified for the evaluation period. • An overall rating of “exceeded expectations” will receive a standard increase as noted above, along with a lump sum identified for the evaluation period.

- Performance coaching. Coaching is the key supervi- sory activity during a performance period. It involves ongoing communication, both formal and informal, that motivates employees by letting them know where they stand in meeting expectations and carrying out responsibilities. The three steps to per- formance coaching are (1) observing performance; (2) providing regular performance feedback, based on information gathered through personal observation, team input, and input from the employee; and (3) documenting performance.

- Performance evaluation. This phase culminates with a meeting of the evaluating supervisor and the em- ployee to rate performance and discuss appropriate salary increases and developmental planning for the employee.

- Performance development. Supervisors should discuss performance development with each employee. A devel- opmental plan mustbe developed for each employee who is rated “does not meet expectations” or “needs improvement” in the area of Employment Terms and Conditions. The structured approach of the developmen- tal plan has three objectives: (1) to enhance employee strengths, (2) to decrease employee areas that need improvements, and (3) to meet organizational and team needs.

- Each year, a specified amount of money is set aside for salary increases. Because funds are limited, the salary increase amounts may be reduced if the department exceeds the allo- cated funds. If the salary increase amounts must be reduced, the reduction percentage will be the same for all employees.

- Unless otherwise authorized, employees at or above pay grade are not eligible for a perform- ance-based salary increase, and employees who are near the pay grade maximum will be granted an increase to the pay grade maximum only.
