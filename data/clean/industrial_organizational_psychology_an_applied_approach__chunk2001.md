# Intrinsic Motivation

When people are intrinsically motivated, they will seek to perform well because they either enjoy performing the actual tasks or enjoy the challenge of success- fully completing the task. When they are extrinsically motivated, they don’t par- ticularly enjoy the tasks but are motivated to perform well to receive some type of reward or to avoid negative consequences (Deci & Ryan, ). People who are intrinsically motivated don’t need external rewards such as pay or praise. In fact, being paid for something they enjoy may reduce their satisfaction and intrinsic motivation (Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, ).

An interesting debate has formed between researchers who believe that rewards reduce intrinsic motivation and those who don’t. A meta-analysis by Cameron and Pierce () concluded that research does not support the idea that rewards reduce intrinsic motivation. However, the meta-analysis has been criticized by Ryan and Deci () as misrepresenting the data. Thus, it appears that this debate will continue.

Individual orientations toward intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can be measured by the Work Preference Inventory (WPI) (Amabile, Hill, Hennessey, & Tighe, ). The WPI yields scores on two dimensions of intrinsic motivation (enjoyment, challenge) and two dimensions of extrinsic motivation (compensa- tion, outward orientation). To determine your own level of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, complete the WPI found in Exercise . in your workbook.
