# Needs for Achievement and Power

A theory developed by McClelland () suggests that employees differ in the extent to which they are motivated by the need for achievement, affiliation, and power. Employees who have a strong need for achievement are motivated by jobs that are challenging and over which they have some control, whereas employees who have minimal achievement needs are more satisfied when jobs involve little challenge and have a high probability of success. In contrast, employees who have a strong need for affiliation are motivated by jobs in which they can work with and help other people. Finally, employees who have a strong need for power are motivated by a desire to influence others rather than simply to be successful.
