# Peak-Time Pay

With peak-time pay, certain employees are encouraged to work only part time but are paid at a higher hourly rate for those hours than employees who work full time. Thus, an employee will make more per hour than her full-time counterpart, although she will make less money per day.

The concept of peak-time pay came from the banking and fast-food indus- tries, both of which face unique problems. Both types of organizations need to be open during the entire day, yet have only approximately four hours per day that are busy. For example, a McDonald’s restaurant might need  employees to cover its lunchtime crowd but need only five employees from  p.m. until  p.m., at which time the dinner crowd begins for another two-hour peak period. Rather than paying  employees to sit around for most of the day, it would be better to have  employees work for three hours a day during peak time and only five employees work the full eight hours.

Unfortunately, few people want to work only three hours a day at $. an hour. And those who would be willing, such as students, are often not available during the most crucial hours. Thus, with peak-time pay,  people may be paid nine dollars or ten dollars per hour to work only the three peak hours. Thus, the employee makes a reasonable amount of money per day, and the organization still saves money over what it would have spent had its employees worked the entire eight hours.
