# General Paresis

By the late nineteenth century large numbers of mentally ill persons were crowded in the large public institutions, some suffering from alcoholism, others from old age and dementia, and still others were probably “natural fools.” Still others suf- fered from various metabolic and neurological diseases and brain damage. Many suffered from general paresis (originally called “general paralysis of the insane” or GPI). Autopsy of the brains revealed widespread brain tissue destruction, but no one knew that general paresis had a speciﬁc pathology linked to syphilis until Krafft-Ebing established that this form of insanity is the tertiary stage of syphilis, a delayed, but not inevitable, result of a syphilitic infection. In 1897, he inoculated with the syphilis spirochete nine individuals with general paresis and no known history of syphilitic infec- tion. None developed secondary symptoms. Researchers concluded that they must have been previously infected, although they had not developed the usual symptoms of syphilis. This ﬁnding established that an early infection with syphilis is the cause of general paresis. The symptoms, which begin to appear 15 to 20 years after the initial infec- tion, include manic-like behavior, with euphoria, delusions of grandeur and persecution and depression, and disorders of speech and locomotion, similar to those found in some major psychiatric disorders. The hypothesis of syphilitic infection was not fully accepted until Noguchi and Moore produced deﬁnitive proof by ﬁnding evidence of the spirochete in the brains of syphilitics (Moore, 1910).
