## Part I • Strategic and General Considerations

provides the information. This also includes an evaluation of the extent to which the goals stated in the development plan have been achieved.

It is important that both the employee and the manager take ownership of the assessment process. The manager fills out her appraisal form, and the employee should also fill out his form. The fact that both parties are involved in the assessment provides good information to be used in the review phase. When both the employee and the supervisor are active participants in the evaluation process, there is a greater likelihood that the information will be used productively in the future. Specifically, the inclusion of self-ratings helps emphasize possible discrepancies between self-views and the views that important others (i.e., supervisors) have of our behavior. It is the discrepancy between these two views that is most likely to trigger development efforts, particularly when feed- back from the supervisor is more negative than are employee self-evaluations.16

The inclusion of self-appraisals is also beneficial regarding important additional factors. Self-appraisals can reduce an employee’s defensiveness during an appraisal meeting and increase the employee’s satisfaction with the performance management system as well as enhance perceptions of accuracy and fairness and therefore accept- ance of the system.17 This point is addressed in more detail in later chapters.

In sum, both the employee and the supervisor must evaluate employee per- formance. Employee involvement in the process increases employee ownership and commitment to the system. In addition, it provides important information to be discussed during the performance review, which is discussed next.
