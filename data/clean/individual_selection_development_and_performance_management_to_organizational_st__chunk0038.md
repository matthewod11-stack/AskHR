## 316 â€¢ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, Fall 2002

To develop federal competency models, occupational analysis surveys are sent out to a stratified, random sample of incumbents and supervisors. The data are collected and ana- lyzed to identify critical competencies and tasks for each occupation. The large number of re- spondents for each survey (e.g., 7,938 for ex- ecutives, supervisors, and managers; 59,997 for seventy-seven clerical and technical jobs; 46,889 for 105 professional and administra- tive jobs) shows the scope of these projects. Data are analyzed for each occupation at every grade (i.e., pay) level where there are sufficient respondents. To create the final competency model for an occupation or occupational group, both incumbent and supervisor ratings are typi- cally used. The Leadership Effectiveness Study, however, surveyed only incumbents.
