# Basic Provisions/Requirements

The Copeland Act's Anti-Kickback provision prohibits contractors and subcontractors performing work on

covered contracts from in any way inducing an employee to give up any part of the compensation to which he

or she is entitled. The Copeland Act and implementing regulations also require contractors and

subcontractors performing on covered contracts to pay their employees on a weekly basis and in cash or a negotiable instrument payable on demand and to submit weekly payroll reports of the wages paid to their

laborers and mechanics during the preceding payroll period. Additionally, the Act's regulations at 29 CFR 3.5

and 3.6 list payroll deductions that are permissible without the approval of DOL and those deductions that

require consent of DOL and prohibit all other payroll deductions.
