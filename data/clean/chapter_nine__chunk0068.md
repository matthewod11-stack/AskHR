2007). When helping consultant nurses and aspiring consultant nurses to become more effective as clinical leaders and facilitators, Manley and Titchen (2011) showed that these practitioners needed help to explore their own effectiveness and become skilled facilitators before they could assist others to become more effective in their work.

Role clarity and/or clear expectations and responsibilities are recognised as important enablers to an effective culture (Bevington et al., 2004b; Jones and Redman, 2000), evidence-based practice and critical thinking (Davies et al., 2000; Newman et al., 2000), and the implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM) (Huq and Martin, 2000). Qualitative 360 degree feedback has been the most frequently tested strategy for achieving role clarity, which at the same time also focuses on giving and receiving of feedback necessary for providing high support and high challenge in the workplace (Garbett et al., 2007; Hardy et al., 2009).

Organisational enablers include flattened and transparent management (Haworth, 2000); an enabling approach to leadership and decision-making (Raiger, 2004); organisational readiness (Huq and Martin, 2000; Newman et al., 2000; Ingersoll et al., 2000; Lewis, 2001; Parisi et al., 2003) and a supportive human resource department (Manley, 2001; Clark, 2002; Chan, 2001; Owen et al., 2001). Flattened and transparent management may be characterised by devolved, participative or non- hierarchical management structures and processes (Haworth, 2000; McMahon et al., 2000; Coccia, 1998; Tiernan et al., 2002; Brayford, 2004) where professionals are viewed as ‘partners in a solution’, not a ‘problem’ (Scalzi, 2006). Good leadership at all levels (Alimo-Metcalf and Alban-Metcalf, 2006), participative management (Shermont and Krepcio, 2006), with executive and organisational support (Raiger, 2005; Manley, 1997, 2001) for trust, empowerment, consistency and mentorship (Kane- Urrabazo, 2006) will help embed values in practice.

Organisational readiness in relation to evidence based practice (Newman et al 2000), TQM (Huq and Martin, 2000) and cultural change (Scalzi et al., 2006) has been defined as ‘a state of preparedness for change that is influenced by the organisation’s previous history of change, its plans for continuous organisational refinement, and its ability through its social and technical systems to initiate and sustain that change’ (Ingersoll et al., 2000, p 13). These researchers showed that employee perception of organisational readiness, followed by organisational culture were the strongest predictors of commitment by employees to the organisation’s goals.

The final organisational enabler is human resource department support. Human resource departments are highly influential because they are responsible for both maintaining the organisation’s values, particularly in relation to recruitment and selection, staff expectations and performance, as well as, being responsible for enabling organisational learning and development (Manley, 2001; Clark, 2002; Chan, 2001; Owen et al., 2001).

The consequences of an effective workplace culture Attending to and working with the enabling factors will assist facilitators of cultural change to increase the likelihood of developing an effective workplace culture with its five defining attributes. Once established, it is proposed that the consequences of having an effective workplace culture can be divided into those impacting on stakeholders, and those impacting on other workplace cultures.

Stakeholders’ goals or needs would be met and demonstrated through the provision of continuous evidence that:

Patients, service users and communities have their needs met in a person-centred way (Owen et al., 2001; Martin, 2000; Parisi et al., 2003; Binnie and Titchen, 1998; Ruvol and Bullis, 2003), including the receipt of both clinically effective and person-centred care
