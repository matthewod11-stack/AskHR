We’ve known for a long time that the pandemic would have a lasting

impact on the way we work and how we think about work. Leaders

are starting to see this for what it is: a period of learning and

experimentation. Early on they found that employees often prefer

working in a hybrid way and that doing so can build engagement and agility. But now they’re also seeing the negative eﬀects that hybrid work

can have—on networks, on innovation—and they recognize that such

best equipped to meet those challenges deeply understand the DNA of

their companies, are open to learning from within and outside their

organizations, and take a positive view of experimenting with new ways

of working.
