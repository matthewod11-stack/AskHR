While workforce diversity offers numerous advantages, it is not without its challenges. Managing a diverse workforce requires careful planning and dedicated effort. One of the primary challenges is fostering an inclusive culture where all employees feel valued and respected. Unconscious bias, stereotypes, and prejudice can undermine diversity initiatives.
