# Prompt Engineering

The number of examples you need for few-shot prompting depends on a few factors,

including the complexity of the task, the quality of the examples, and the capabilities of the

generative AI (gen AI) model you are using. As a general rule of thumb, you should use at

least three to (cid:450)ve examples for few-shot prompting. However, you may need to use more examples for more complex tasks, or you may need to use fewer due to the input length
