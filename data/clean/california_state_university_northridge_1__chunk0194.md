Kristen's involvement was approving the final candidates that the author recommended in

writing and meeting with each person selected. Understanding the importance of an

excellent training program that is rooted in the law, followed by company policies, the

author assisted those who aspired to take a supervisor position. In this training program,

the author did not focus on management styles, for they were already managers in their

current positions (not directly over any particular set of employees) but on the laws and

company policies. Simply, the author stated what is necessary for an evaluation, hiring,

termination, discipline and budget preparations. All three employees were promoted to a

supervisor position and have done extremely well.

When the author started at Host Marriott Services Corporation, new employees

(managers) were hired in groups of seven. Each class of managers went through two

weeks of in class training before being transferred into the field. After the in class training,

the group was then individually assigned to a business ll!lit for one month to become

familiar with the business operations. After the month was completed, the group then

became individually assigned to a permanent location. As apart of each groups overall

training program, the manager had tailored training covering union contracts, discipline,

inventory, cost control and other areas deemed essential by the company. This part of the

training started after the managers were assigned to a business unit and completion of all

training programs was mandatory. After the first round, the group progressed to the next

round, which added new areas and went into more depth for topics covered at the first
