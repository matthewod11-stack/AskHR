# Data collection and analysis

Given the sensitive nature of discussion of the status of co-workers and subordinates, many

of the informants requested that we limit ourselves to note taking. This meant that extensive

field notes were taken, transcribed verbatim and cross-checked with the informants to ensure

accuracy. Following the “24-hour rule” (Eisenhardt, 1989), text and field notes were

transcribed verbatim within 24 hours of each interview. This helped to establish a clear

chronology of events and capitalise on the immediacy of our data (Gioia & Thomas, 1996;

Whyte, 1994). Interview data were transcript coded into common themes and issues. In all,

we conducted 61 interviews in both countries.

To analyse our data, we employ a narrative strategy (Langley, 1999) by writing a

detailed field note and summary for each informant covering the issues noted above. We

developed a chronology and narrative accounts. We then looked for patterns and similarities

in their responses, and then organised the data to allow meanings to be deduced. As observed

12

by Eisenhardt (1989, p. 541), “the juxtaposition of seemingly similar cases by a researcher

looking for differences can break simplistic frames”. The data analysis replicated the

inductive grounded theory development process (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Sutton, 1991)

which “requires that data and theory be constantly compared and contrasted throughout the

data collection and analysis process” (Isabella, 1990, p. 12).The process led to classifications

of responses into sections such as causes of underperformance, firms’ responses and

persistence with underperformance. The interview data were supported with secondary data

gleaned from sources such as press releases, internal documents, company websites,

newspapers and additional materials provided by the informants. In presenting the findings,

we used letter N to denote informants from Nigeria and letter G to denote informants from

Ghana. Table 2 provides an overview of our times of data collection and data sources.
