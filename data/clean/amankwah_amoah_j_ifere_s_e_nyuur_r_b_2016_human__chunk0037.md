We developed semi-structured interview questions to elicit the views of these

professionals. To narrow down the scope of the study, the interviews covered the following

broad areas. In the first set of questions, we focused on the informantsâ€™ employers, incentive

11

and rewards system, and decision-making processes. The questions also focused on the key

challenges in the workplace, hiring and firing. We also asked the informants whether they

managed or worked with any employee who had consistently underperformed over a long

period of time. The final set of questions revolved around causes of underperformance,

processes in dealing with underperformance, options in dealing with underperforming

workers, why firms hung on to them, and their experiences and views. They were also asked

about the difficulties in dealing with and managing underperforming workers including how

the firm deals with early-warning signals of performance decline by employees. Some of the

authors conducted the interviews from early 2014 to early 2015. On average, the interviews

lasted around 60 minutes. Given the focus on two countries, we sought to ensure a greater

level of consistency as well as a degree of flexibility to allow new insights to emerge

(Robson, 2002).
