Men will also benefit from an increase in gender equality? Workplace equality plans are of no value in promoting equality between women and men?

Varimax rotation was performed. Factor loadings greater than .46 are shown in bold.

Response categories were from 1 = fully agree to 4 = fully disagree. The alpha coefficient was .67.

Independent variables: the variables were measured as follows:
