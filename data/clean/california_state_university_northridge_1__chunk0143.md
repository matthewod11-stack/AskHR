# Host Marriott Services Corporation

Host Marriott Services Corporation has a union contract for employees. There are

management employees and non-management employees. The general manager, Human

Resource representative, their assistant, terminal managers and individual store managers,

all consisted of non-union employees. However, the employees were hourly employees

and as apart of the union, paying union dues. They consisted of 70% or more of the

workforce, while management filled the remaining percentage. Once an employee was

hired, he or she was required to join the union and had money taken out of their paycheck

for dues as specified, pursuant to the contract. The union representative worked on behalf

of the hourly employees, addressing any concerns they felt management was not dealing

with fairly. Essentially, their primary role being was an advocate for employee rights and

ensuring fundamental fairness, pursuant to the contract. As a result of the U11ion contract,

wrongful discharge complaints were next to none, or they did not last long.

While at Marriott, it was the author's responsibility as store manager to become

thoroughly familiar with the interworkings of the union contract. The contract delineated

how overtime and layoff would work. Seniority of an employee played a factor in how an

employee was handled. In regards to layoffs, employees with seniority were laid off last

and given the option to work within a new area first, once an opening became available.

In addition, an employee could not be subject to demotion in pay. This meant that, if an

employee bei.,g paid $10.85 fu1 hour i.i1 their cw-rent position, took a lesser position in

which the employee hired for that position was paid $8.95 per hour, the transferring

48

employee would retain their pay of$10.85 an hour. Furthermore, an employee being paid

$10.85 an hour could accept a greater position where the starting pay is $12.58 an hour,

would be required to start at $12.58 an hour. In short, no employee can receive a pay less

than his or her current rate of pay. Days off were also regulated, an employee could work

seven or more days straight without time off. If this occurred, there were guidelines in

place on how many days he or she was entitled, pursuant the union contract.

In regard to discipline, Host Marriott Services Corporation followed a

progressive discipline process. The guidelines are clearly stated within the contract and

listing the actions that are permissible by management to impose. An employee who

refused to follow a direct order could be written up for insubordination on the spot,

without question, as long as the requested order is not a violation of the contract.

Exceptions include blatant safety issues in regards to customers, (i.e., water on the floor).

The author asked an employee to mop up water on the floor. The employee in question,

refused, on the grounds that it was not his responsibility. In this situation, the customer's

need for safety prevailed. It is a right that Marriott can ask any employee to remedy the

situation. The employee refused to mop the floor and another employee rectified the

problem. The first employee was written up for insubordination, pursuant to the contract.

Yet, the second employee became upset because his coworker had passed the buck to him;

therefore his reaction was negative. The first employee in question did apologize, and

another situation was resolved.

However, there are generally about five managers per terminal, supervising an

average of 40 or more employees. Each manager had a different style, which was

49

acceptable to the extent that all manager act in concert when administering disciplinary

action. If an employee arrives 40 minutes late everyday and is written up by two of the

managers and no notation by the other three, then there is a problem. A union

representative would argue in this particular situation that said employee was not treated

the same by all managers. If all five managers wrote this employee up for the tardiness

and not another employee, a problem existed. A union representative is allowed to argue

that employee X who is also late has never been written up therefore, the employee in

question cannot be punished. Unfortunately, this is what takes place and how employees

are exempt from suspension and written reprimand carry no weight. Fortunately, this

problem of inconsistency was rectified. All newly hired managers had to participate in

training classes in all areas of the business. One of the topics that were covered was the

union contract and maintaining consistency throughout the business unit. As a result of

the effort, management consistency had improved within the company.

Assuming that consistency had applied, the union representative would file a

complaint on the violation in question, along with the action taken. The union

representative goal was to have the employee reinstated back to work or have the action

taken, removed from the personnel file. The first step was for the employee to meet with

the union representative and explain their side of the story and receive a copy of the file.

At this point it becomes imperative for the employee to have full disclosure. The union

representative would meet with a Marriott manager in an effort to resolve the situation.

If this did not work, then the next step would be mediation then arbitration. Should

mediation not work, and then arbitration is the final step. The arbitration process cost

50

both sides money however; the union was limited in resources. The author was told that

this process could be drawn out if necessary, this meant Marriott had deep pockets, to the

extent the union would cease this process, based on their budget. Due to the cost factor,

as managers, we were informed that the company would back us and money was not a
