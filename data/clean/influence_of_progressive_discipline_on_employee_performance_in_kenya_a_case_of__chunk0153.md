# Sample size and Sampling Technique

Kothari (2004) defines a sample size as the number of items to be selected from the universe to constitute a sample. The research used the stratified simple random sampling design to select the sample that represented the population. Random sampling refers to random selection of units from a group. According to Orodho (2005) in stratified random sampling, subjects are selected in such a way that the sample gives equal representation from each stratum.

According to Cohen and Lawrence (1995), a sample of 10% of the population is adequate in large populations, while 20% of the population is acceptable as the population is small. In this study, 50% was used as the population was small, hence the 65 employees out of 130 employees of Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy Ltd were used for the study. This sampling design was used because the research felt to study both the sub-groups using their departmental areas. The sample size constituted of 65 respondents drawn from eight departments of Mukurwe-ini Wakulima dairy as shown in Table 3.2;
