# Spread of Clinics

Witmer’s clinical psychology and Hall’s child study stimu- lated the rise of clinics in hospital, residential care, college and university, juvenile courts, and public school settings (Wallin, 1914). The ﬁrst school-based clinic, the Department of Scientiﬁc Pedagogy and Child Study, was founded in 1899 in the Chicago public schools (Slater, 1980). Over time, this agency shifted from a nomothetic to a more idiographic clinical approach and still operates as the district’s Bureau of Child Study. Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles, New Orleans, NewYork, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Rochester, Seattle, St. Louis, and several other urban, and a few rural, school systems had clinics by the end of this period. The orientations of the school-based clinics were often nomo- thetic and idiographic; some carried names such as “bureau of educational research,” while others were speciﬁcally clini- cal and referred to as psychological services. Thus, school psychological services developed from both idiographic clinical and nomothetic orientations. Contemporary school psychology continues to reﬂect both orientations as seen in the emphases on work with individuals and groups and the use of normative data and instruments within a clinical child study model. By the end of the period, several individ- ual school districts had hired school psychologists to facili- tate special educational placement of children, whether or not the district had a formal clinic.
