## allows for upward and down wards communication between employees throughout the

company. There is a question and answer portion to Human Resource database, which

the author utilized. The author wrote to Colette Roan a Human Resources representative

( early stages of my research) about the at-will employee status of employee ''In regards to

employment at-will of employees (the company may terminate the employment

relationship at any time with or without cause, without prior notice) appears to clear cut.

However, am I correct to understand there are minimum requirements to be met by the

employer when exercising this doctrine, due to the fact that this doctrine has been

challenged in court by employees (petitioner) against an employer? In situations where the

petitioner prevailed, has the doctrine been watered down? As I present this, I am keeping

in mind that each case is based on the totality of the circumstances and may not warrant a

case for wrongful termination. At the moment I do not have recent court rulings, I would

need to consult LEXIS-NEXIS and other resources. Lastly, I currently understand that if

an employer is taken to court, the new standard of just cause must be proven since evil

intent vvas such a difficult burden to prove" (Robert Hubbard, 1999). On Februai.J 3,

1999 the question was directed to Robin Katz in our Legal Department, which was never

36

answered. The exact question was reprinted and sent to Robin again on February 22,

- 1999. Till this day there has not been a response from any person from legal on this

matter. It appears that this is not a subject those in management do not like to discuss due

to possible ramifications their response may have in the long run. On the other hand,

employees not in management have no problems stating their views on the subject or

experience's friends may have shared with them on the issue.
