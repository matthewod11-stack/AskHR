# Learn from decisions together.

There may still be times where your boss makes a rash decision you

disagree with, says Martin. It’s hard, but “ultimately, it’s their call.”

Even in those cases, Banu suggests talking to your boss about ways the

decision could have been handled diﬀerently. Don’t complain; focus on

continuous improvement. “If the train has left the station and there’s no

going back, all you can do is learn from it together,” Martin says.

Start by expressing your desire to work together. “Say, ‘I appreciate all

that you’re doing to get up to speed and help our team, and I’d like to

talk about how we can better support each other in accomplishing our

goals,” suggests Martin. Then, explain that you need more resources,

inclusion, information, or simply to be kept in the loop earlier in the

process. “Speak their language,” says Banu.

Focus on what you can control.

Learning from past decisions and working with your boss is important,

but Martin suggests that there comes a point where it’s necessary to

practice acceptance. “Concentrate on what you can control and let go of

the rest,” he says. Identify areas where you have inﬂuence, and channel

your energy into improving day-to-day outcomes for your team.

Take exceptional care of yourself outside work, too, adds Banu. “You

might not realize how draining these situations are and how much

they deplete your mental and physical energy.” She recommends getting

regular exercise, spending time outdoors, eating well, and practicing

mindfulness meditation. “Take advantage of all the self-care tools at

your disposal,” she says.
