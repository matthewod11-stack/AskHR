# Recordkeeping, Notices and Posters

Contractors are required to display the "Know Your Rights" poster. The poster must be displayed in

conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment such as the personnel oï¬ƒce,

work-out facility, lunchroom, or company bulletin board. The contractor must ensure that applicants or

employees with disabilities are provided the notice in a form that is accessible and understandable to the individual applicant or employee (e.g., providing Braille or large print versions of the notice or posting a copy

of the notice at a lower height for easy viewing by a person using a wheelchair). With respect to employees

who do not work at a physical location of the contractor, a contractor will satisfy its posting obligations by
