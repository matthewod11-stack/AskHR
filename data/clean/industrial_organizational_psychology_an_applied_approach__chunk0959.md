Due to cost considerations, many employers have cut back on the use of on-campus recruiting. As a result, an increasing number of colleges are organizing virtual job fairs, in which their students and alumni can use the Web to “visit” with recruiters from hundreds of organizations at one time. In a virtual job fair, applicants can talk to or instant-message a recruiter, learn more about the company, and submit résumés.

Outside Recruiters More than % of organizations use such outside recruiting sources as private employment agencies, public employment agencies, and executive search firms (SHRM, b). Private employment agencies and executive search firms are designed to make a profit from recruitment activities, whereas public employ- ment agencies are operated by state and local public agencies and are strictly nonprofit.

Employment Agencies and Search Firms Employment Agencies Employment agencies operate in one of two ways. They charge either the com- pany or the applicant when the applicant takes the job. The amount charged usually ranges from % to % of the applicant’s first-year salary.

From an organization’s perspective, there are few risks in using an employ- ment agency that charges the applicant for its services. That is, if the employment agency cannot find an appropriate candidate, the organization has not wasted money. But if the employment agency is successful, the organization gets a quali- fied employee at no cost.

Employment agencies are especially useful if an HR department is overloaded with work or if an organization does not have an individual with the skills and experience needed to select employees properly. The disadvantage of employ- ment agencies is that a company loses some control over its recruitment process and may end up with undesirable applicants. Remember, most “counselors” at employment agencies are hired because of their skill in sales, not because of their solid background in the area of personnel selection. In fact, one employ- ment agency turned down one of its own job applicants because the applicant had earned a degree in personnel management. During the interview the head of the agency told the applicant, “We are not really looking for a personnel profes- sional. What we want is the type of person who could sell aluminum siding to the owner of a brick home.”

The applicant can seldom go wrong using an employment agency. If the fee is charged to the company, the applicant gets a job at no cost. However, even if the fee is charged to the applicant, the applicant may still benefit. For example, sup- pose you are having difficulty finding a job, and an employment agency finds you a good job paying $, per year. Spending $, to obtain a good job might be worthwhile because every month of unemployment is costing you $, in lost income. So, the fee is essentially one month’s salary that you would not have earned anyway without the job.

Executive Search Firms Executive search firms, better known as “head hunters,” differ from employment agencies in several ways. First, the jobs they represent tend to be higher-paying, non–entry-level positions such as executives, engineers, and computer pro- grammers. Second, reputable executive search firms always charge their fees to organizations rather than to applicants. Third, fees charged by executive search firms tend to be about % of the applicant’s first-year salary.

A word of caution about both employment agencies and executive search firms: Because they make their money on the number of applicants they place,

they tend to exert tremendous pressure on applicants to take jobs that are offered. But applicants are not obligated to take jobs and should not be intimidated about turning down a position that appears to be a poor match.

Public Employment Agencies The third type of outside recruitment organization is state and local employment agencies. These public employment agencies are designed primarily to help the unemployed find work, but they often offer services such as career advisement and résumé preparation. From the organization’s perspective, public employ- ment agencies can be of great value in filling blue-collar and clerical positions. Not only is there no cost involved in hiring the applicants, but often government programs are also available that will help pay training costs. In addition, with the advent of standardized testing programs (which will be discussed in Chapter ), the quality of employees hired through public agencies is now much higher than in the past.

Many public employment agencies have made finding jobs easier by placing kiosks in locations such as shopping malls and public buildings. Applicants can use the kiosks to search for local job openings and get information on how they can apply for the jobs. Recruiting kiosks are increasingly being used by employers that receive large numbers of walk-in applicants. Rather than speaking to a receptionist, potential job applicants can use the kiosk located in the company lobby to search for current job openings and then apply to jobs for which they are qualified.
