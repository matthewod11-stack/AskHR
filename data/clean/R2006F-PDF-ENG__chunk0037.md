from straight to curve. In contrast, Apple’s leaders insist on continuous

curves, resulting in a shape known in the design community as a

“squircle”: The slope starts sooner but is less abrupt. An advantage of

hardware products without abrupt changes in curvature is that they

produce softer highlights (that is, little to no jump in light reﬂection

along the corner). The diﬀerence is subtle, and executing on it isn’t
