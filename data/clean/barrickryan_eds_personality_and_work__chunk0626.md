# CHAPTER 8

Self-Monitoring Personality and Work Relationships Individual Differences in Social Networks David V. Day Martin Kilduff

Relationships form the core of any organization. Creating and main- taining effective work relationships allows for task coordination, in- formation ﬂow, and other work processes necessary for accomplishing the goals and objectives of an organization. Management, in partic- ular, is a relationship-based discipline. According to Gabarro (1987), “The importance of interpersonal relationships as an aspect of man- agement is documented in study after study of managerial behavior, regardless of national culture or type of management job” (p. 172). Relationships are also important for individual success. An emerging literature demonstrates the role that social capital plays in individual job performance, leadership, and career success. So- cial capital is created when relations between people are formed that help facilitate instrumental organizational action (Coleman, 1990). Social capital is a key to individual success because it pro- vides access to critical information and other social resources (Seib- ert, Kraimer, & Liden, 2001). There are also individual differences in the quantity and quality of relationships that form the basis of social capital.
