assessment forms the basis for developing strategies to eliminate or reduce these risks. It may involve redesigning processes, providing personal protective equipment (PPE), or instituting safety procedures.

Furthermore, OHS regulations vary by country and industry, but they all share a common objective: safeguarding workers. These regulations set the minimum standards for workplace safety and are typically enforced by government agencies. They establish guidelines for everything from the safe use of machinery to the handling of hazardous materials, ensuring that employers take necessary precautions to protect their workforce. Accidents and injuries can have devastating consequences for both workers and employers. OHS measures aim to reduce these incidents by creating a safer work environment. This, in turn, leads to increased productivity, reduced absenteeism, and lower healthcare costs for companies. Additionally, it helps preserve the mental and physical health of employees, fostering a more satisfied and engaged workforce. In addition to physical safety, OHS also addresses the psychological well-being of employees. Psychosocial hazards, such as workplace stress, bullying, and harassment, can have profound effects on mental health and productivity. OHS programs encourage employers to create a respectful and inclusive workplace culture that prioritizes mental health and supports employees in times of need. OHS is not only about risk avoidance but also about preparedness. In the event of an accident or emergency, workplaces should have well-defined procedures and resources in place to respond effectively. This includes first aid training, emergency exits, fire drills, and the provision of appropriate safety equipment. Being prepared can make a significant difference in the outcome of a workplace incident.

The success of OHS initiatives depends on collaboration among all stakeholders, including employers, employees, government agencies, and industry organizations. When everyone works together to prioritize safety, the result is a harmonious and productive work environment where employees can thrive. Additionally, OHS goes hand in hand with ongoing education and training. As workplaces evolve, so do the associated risks. Continuous learning and skill development help workers stay informed about the latest safety procedures and best practices. This empowers them to make informed decisions and respond effectively to emerging hazards. The benefits of OHS extend beyond the workplace. A strong OHS program can enhance a company's reputation, making it an attractive employer and partner in the eyes of clients and investors. It also aligns with corporate social responsibility goals, demonstrating a commitment to the well-being of employees and the community at large. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) is an indispensable aspect of modern workplaces. Its holistic approach to safeguarding workers' health and safety encompasses a wide range of preventive measures, risk assessments, regulations, and support mechanisms. A strong OHS program not only reduces accidents and injuries but also contributes to a positive workplace culture, increased productivity, and a healthier bottom line for organizations. It is a collective responsibility that demands the commitment of employers, employees, and society as a whole to create safer, healthier, and more productive workplaces[3], [4].
