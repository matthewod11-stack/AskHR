# the potential

Addressing pay via the Agenda for Change (DH, 2003) programme, which aims to modernise the salary system of the British NHS by providing competency- based pay (a variant of performance-related pay), has been suggested as a potential source of conﬂict for employees’ expectations, norms of fairness and practice (Grimshaw, 2000) although such a perspective has its detractors. In a case study undertaken as a precursor to Agenda for Change evaluation, Meerabeau et al.(2004) found that a competency-based pay system was valued it provided structured role by staff who felt development. This dissonance demands that close attention be paid to evaluation of this system when it is introduced nationally.
