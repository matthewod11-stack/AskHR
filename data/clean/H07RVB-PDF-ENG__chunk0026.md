# Me, too.

ADI IGNATIUS:

There must be people who are watching this or who would read your

book who are like, “OK, I hear that. Good for you. But I just don’t dare.

I’m in this state or in this industry, or it’s too scary.” What’s your advice

to people who are feeling that?

JIM FIELDING:

I’m not cavalier about this at all. I feel for those people. I am not saying,

read my book and follow the 10 leadership lessons and your life will be

milk and honey. I’ve talked to several people, even lately on this journey,

who absolutely just do not feel comfortable and feel that they would

hurt their economic security, their ﬁnancial security, or their personal

security to come out at work and they don’t have the ability to change.

What I’ve said to them is, “I hear that. I respect that. I feel sorry for

you. But then what I ask you to do is, when you are at home and when

you are in a safe space, is home safe to you? Are the things you’re

doing outside of work feeding your soul and allowing you to be who you

authentically are? Can you volunteer with local queer organizations? Do

you get to express your queerness in other ways outside of work? If you

have to be that closeted and that concerned at work, then I really hope

in your personal life you can expand nights and weekends.”
