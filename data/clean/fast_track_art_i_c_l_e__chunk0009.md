## Understanding Individual-Level and Company-Level Success

Company-level analysis, for the purposes of describing the inﬂuence of best practices in this article, refers to differences in engagement rates and health improvement outcomes between com- panies. Individual-level analysis means changes occurring within the employee population within companies, but which may be com- pared across companies. The studies described previously afﬁrm the utility of understanding the contributors to EHM success, although they each had methodological limitations that moderate the utility of the ﬁndings. First, company-level analysis based on composite best practices scores offers limited insight into how best practices affect subgroups within these populations. Second, employee par- ticipation in HAs is an instructive outcome of interest but likely provides only modest insight into how best practices components impact other outcomes of interest such as completing more intensive intervention programs or achieving sustained health improvement. Indeed, one recent study suggests that ﬁnancial incentives may di- minish the effectiveness of interventions, perhaps by encouraging program enrollment for those not intrinsically motivated.29

Finally, research is scarce concerning whether company-level best practices variables and outcomes differ appreciably from, or markedly inﬂuence, individual health-related variables and out- comes. Very few studies proffer a structured analysis approach that enables an assessment of the interaction between best practices com- ponents and their respective impact on multiple levels of program engagementatthecompanyorindividuallevelofanalysis.Onestudy examined ﬁve company-level variables, using the HERO Employee Health Management (EHM) Best Practice Scorecard, in collabo- ration with Mercer C(cid:2), along with six individual-level variables as assessed by an HA questionnaire.30 Using employees as the unit for analysis, Grossmeier30 found that engagement in a telephone- based intervention program varied by age and sex. After controlling for other health-related variables, this study showed that age and sex weresigniﬁcantlycorrelatedwiththreelevelsofengagement,includ- ing program enrollment as well as active participation and program completion.Understandingthiscascadeisvital,giventhepreponder- ance of EHM research showing that participation and completion are clearly linked with successful behavior change outcomes.31–33 Sim- ilar ﬁndings were reported in a study that compared EHM outcomes between two companies in different industries.34 In this randomized, controlled trial, sex and age were shown to be differentials of inﬂu- enceinbothrecruitmentandretentionofemployeesintointervention programs.
