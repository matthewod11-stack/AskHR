# studies and ﬁeld-based experimental

Finally, our sampling methods have come of age. Shifts in awareness of the importance of sampling have led to an in- crease in use of large representative national samples in de- velopmental research. Although this has typically been the domain of sociologists and survey researchers, in the early 1990s, developmentalists have shown an increased aware- ness of the potential value of supplementing their usual small-sample strategies with these large-sample approaches. One prominent example is the use of the National Longitudi- nal Study of Youth (NLSY) for the examination of develop- mental issues, including divorce, achievement, and day care (Brooks-Gunn, Phelps, & Elder, 1991). These surveys have several advantages, including a large number of subjects, more representative samples, a multifaceted range of vari- ables, and longitudinal designs. In turn, these characteristics permit testing of more complex models of development that require large numbers of subjects. In addition, these studies allow examination of connections across content-based do- mains as well as encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation. Finally, they permit testing of the cultural generality of the models.

Newer, more innovative approaches that combine levels of sampling are becoming increasingly common as well. As a supplement to a large-scale survey approach, researchers are

selecting subsamples of subjects for more intensive examina- tion of a particular process of interest. For example, Beitel and Parke (1998) conducted a survey of 300 families to as- sess maternal attitudes toward father involvement in infant care. To supplement this approach, in which a self-report questionnaire was used, a subsample of 40 families was observed in their homes as a way of validating the self-report data. Similarly, Reiss et al. (2000) generated a nationally rep- resentative sample of stepfamilies, and in a second stage of their work, they observed these families in interaction tasks in the home. These combined approaches increase the gener- alizability of ﬁndings and, at the same time, allow us to illu- minate basic social processes.
