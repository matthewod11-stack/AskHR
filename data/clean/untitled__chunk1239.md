These earlier theorists inﬂuenced thinking and re- search in ways that are still evident today, and a review of their contributions reminds us that many questions in our ﬁeld are recurring ones. Issues that have disappeared and reappeared in slightly different guises at various stages of the ﬁeld’s history are still part of the contemporary scene. It’s not that developmentalists simply recycle problems, but progress often proceeds to a point and comes to a halt until develop- ments in other ﬁelds, new conceptualizations and formula- tions of a problem, or methodological and design advances reenergize the issue and bring it to a new level of understand- ing and investigation. By stimulating interest in the historical roots of our discipline, we hope both to sharpen our appreci- ation of our forebears and to develop a source of hypotheses that may now be ripe for investigation in the current scientiﬁc climate.
