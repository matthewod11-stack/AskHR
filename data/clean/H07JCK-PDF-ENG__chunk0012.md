Micromanaging means we’re impinging on our employee’s autonomy,

which is a core psychological need. By outlining a clear vision for

results, you enable employees to either take the lead or to elicit more

guidance. Ensure that you’ve connected the outcomes you’re seeking

to the company’s larger vision and goals. People want to feel they are

doing meaningful work and aligning purpose between the individual

and organization can boost engagement.

- 5. Am I holding everyone to the same standard?

Despite our best intentions, unconscious bias can cause us to favor

some people over others. Understanding the uniqueness of the

employee at hand, consider whether you’re holding all team members to

the same standard. Are you tougher on men, women, or people of color?

Do you invest time equally in your team’s development? Do you make

assumptions based on age? Having clarity on results can also help you

avoid unconscious bias. If you’re unsure whether you are being fair, you

can also talk with a trusted colleague to get their view on the situation.

Another bias to be aware of is proximity bias, which describes how

managers can be more inclined to favor those who are physically closer

to them. If you work in a hybrid environment, do you give preference in work assignments to people who come to the oﬃce more often? Note

that proximity bias disproportionately impacts women and caregivers.
