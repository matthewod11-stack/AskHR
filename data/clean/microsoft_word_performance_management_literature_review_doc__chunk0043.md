management processes. Karuhanga (2010) also recognises that a committed and supportive workforce is necessary for effective implementation of performance management systems.

The natural conclusion here is that a ‘one size fits all’ appraisal governed by the need to document a complex agenda is not appropriate.

Technology is also being used to help to try to engage employees more to trust and even enjoy the process. McGregor, (2009) reports that ‘employers are trying out social networking-style systems that aim to improve – and take the dread – out of annual reviews’. Accenture has developed a Facebook-style program called Performance Multiplier that lets employees post status updates and personal weekly goals. Rypple lets people post Twitter length questions about their performance in return for anonymous feedback, and has software to replace the standard annual review with quick monthly surveys and discussions. By prompting people to document and adjust their goals and learning constantly Accenture hopes that the formal process discussions will also improve.

This is a step beyond earlier automation of the performance appraisal process. E- performance management often simply made electronic what was previously a paper process. Whilst generating better management information (on say performance by grade, gender, division, etc.), there was little additional functionality offered (eg to segment the process by say work area). Indeed, it permitted the easier management of remote workers, yet risked a de- humanisation of the process.

Bourne et al. (2000) state that implementation of performance management concerns the systems established for collecting and processing data that enable regular measurement. They suggest this can involve computer programming to capture data already within a system or implementing new procedures, so that information currently not recorded is captured or it can involve new initiatives such as the introduction of an employee survey. Bourne et al. however also identify computer system issues as an obstacle to the full implementation of performance management within organisations.

The literature shows that performance management and appraisal schemes need to be adequately co-ordinated and monitored. ‘In addition to evaluating employees on a regular basis, organisations should assess the effectiveness of the appraisal system periodically’ (Schraeder, 2007, p.23). Rees and Porter (2004) argue that the role of
