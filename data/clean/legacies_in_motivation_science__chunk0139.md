# Generality.

Our focus on generality has implications for how the issue of replication might best be ad- dressed in the psychological sciences and maybe elsewhere. The emphasis in many dis- cussions of replication has been on exact repli- cation of single studies. But it is hard to know how a study using one task, one set of instruc- tions, one setting, one type of measure, one time span, and one class of participants and so forth will generalize. Our view is that generality is best achieved by replication with variation of the type used in our research program.

Mediators. Goal research showed that goal mediators include choice/attention, effort, and persistence. Goals were also found to motivate people to use existing strategies for goal attain- ment or to discover new ones (Seijts & Latham, 2005; Winters & Latham, 1996). Having rele- vant strategies for goal attainment is a fourth mediator.

An important ﬁnding of goal research on the opposite side of the mediator coin showed that self-set goals along with self-efﬁcacy could me- diate the results of other motivators on perfor- mance (e.g., assigned goals, feedback, person- ality, incentives, job design, and leadership). This research was updated by Locke (2001).

Moderators. We identiﬁed four modera- tors of goal-performance effects. Feedback is critical to goal effects because it enables people to track progress so that effort and strategy can be adjusted to attain the goal. Goals and feed-

back work better together to increase perfor- mance than either one alone.

A second moderator is goal commitment. A goal that one is not committed to attain will not affect that person’s actions. The ultimate proof of commitment is action, but self-report scales can be useful (Klein, Cooper, & Monahan, 2013). Commitment is especially important when a goal is difﬁcult to attain because the goal requires more effort and persistence when setbacks are inevita- bly experienced. Commitment is affected by val- ues, including incentives, and self-efﬁcacy.

A third moderator, which as noted is also a mediator, is ability, namely knowledge or skill. People cannot attain goals if they do not know how to do so. This is an example of motivation and cognition working together (see Wood, Whelan, Sojo, & Wong, 2013). Perceptions by supervisors that the goals assigned to them by their managers are excessively difﬁcult has been shown subsequently to be related to their abuse of employees (Mawritz, Folger, & Latham, 2014).

Situational factors. Situational factors, a fourth moderator, affect the goal-performance relationship. Goal-directed action may be facil- itated or hindered by environmental factors and the degree of support an individual receives (e.g., people, money, facilities).

Affect. Goals are by their nature something one values. Emotions are based on subconscious value judgments (Locke, 2009). Thus, goal attain- ment is related to affect (see Locke & Latham, 1990, Chapter 10). Numerous studies show that goal attainment is related to satisfaction. However, there is an apparent paradox. Difﬁcult goals are less likely to be attained than easier goals, thus making satisfaction harder to experience. So why do people try to attain them? The explanation, provided by an experiment by Mento, Locke, and Klein (1992), is that attaining challenging goals is often the path to more internal and external ben- eﬁts than easier goals (e.g., pride, educational cre- dentials, better job, higher pay).

Expectancy and self-efﬁcacy. Another par- adox arose in relation to the expectancy theory, which states that a higher expectancy of perfor- mance effectiveness is more motivating than a
