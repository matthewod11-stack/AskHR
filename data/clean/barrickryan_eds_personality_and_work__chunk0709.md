# 240 PERSONALITY AND WORK

represents individuals with the same level of conscientiousness, yet the amount of feedback seeking across the three different situa- tions varies for these types of individuals, with more feedback seek- ing in group settings than in one-on-one or computer-based training. What is important to note is that each of the three graphs in Figure 9.1, if taken separately, depicts a typical individual- differences approach to training research (whether the level of conscientiousness predicts a learning behavior or outcome in a particular situation), but across graphs, one sees conceptually the inï¬‚uence of different situations and the more complex interac- tions of the person, the situation, and learning.
