# INTO THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY

Looking backward from the vantage point of the new millen- nium, we see certain themes recurring in cyclical form. The dilemma posed by the need to care for persons unable to care forthemselvesversustheneedtorespectindividualrightsand liberties to make personal decisions leads to a cycle in which society creates institutions to provide the necessary care and later discharges the patients on civil rights principles. Ad- vances made in technologies for other purposes prove to have signiﬁcant effects in forwarding our understanding of psy- chopathology investigations and treatments. The microscope, the x-ray, electroencephalography, and brain imaging are ex- amples of this. The emphasis on genetics and brain function shifts in time to an emphasis on social/environmental factors in the genesis of behavior. Themes within psychology in gen- eral, mostly signiﬁcant but sometimes faddish, ﬁnd reﬂection in psychopathology research trends. What is clear is that with progress our questions are becoming more sophisticated, and our answers more complicated.
