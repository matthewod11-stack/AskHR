# What Is “Blind Hiring”?

As a decision-making strategy more broadly, “blinding” involves

blocking evaluators from receiving potentially biasing information

about a target of evaluation until after an evaluation is complete. Blind

hiring policies typically implement this strategy at the initial screening

stage of the hiring pipeline, when hiring managers or other decision-

makers decide which applicants to interview and which to screen out of
