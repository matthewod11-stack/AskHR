# Synthetic Integration

Perhaps the best way to achieve a certain coherence in the ﬁeld is to recognize that there is no one right “model” or “ap- proach” and that different ones elucidate different aspects of a very complex phenomenon. Models such as the systems models are useful in attempting integrations, but they fall short in integrating all that we know about intelligence. Eventually, the time may come when such large-scale inte- grations can be achieved in ways that are theoretically meri- torious and empirically sound. In the meantime, it is likely that many different conceptions of intelligence will compete for the attention of the scientiﬁc as well as the lay public.
