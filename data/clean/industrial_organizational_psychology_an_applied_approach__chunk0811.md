## of the major life activities of an individual;

. A record of such impairment; or . Being regarded as having such an impairment.

For the first part of the definition, major life activities include such things as walking, hearing, and speaking. The ADAAA expanded the list of major life activities to include the operation of major bodily functions (e.g., digestive, bowel, bladder). A condition that keeps a person from working a particular job, as opposed to all jobs

or a class of jobs, is not a disability (Toyota v. Williams, ). Examples of condi- tions considered disabilities by case law or the U.S. Department of Labor are blind- ness, paralysis, asthma, muscular dystrophy, and various learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Conditions not considered by the courts to be disabilities have included fear of heights, color blindness, hypertension, depression, temporary illnesses such as pneumonia, sprained ankles, being  pounds overweight, carpal tunnel syn- drome, and wearing glasses.

The second part of the definition was designed to protect people who were once disabled but no longer are. Examples include recovering alcoholics, cancer patients in remission, people who spent time in a mental health facility, and drug addicts who have successfully completed treatment.

The final part of the definition protects individuals who don’t have a disabil- ity but are regarded or treated as if they do. Examples of people protected under this clause are those with facial scarring or severe burns. In an interesting case (Johnson v. Apland & Associates, ), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that a man missing  teeth had a right to file an ADA suit on the grounds that he was regarded as having a disability. The case was sent back to the lower court to determine whether this perception actually “substantially” limited “one or more major life activit[ies].”

The ADAA expanded this part of the definition, clarified that if an impairment was expected to last less than six months, it would not be considered a disability, and clarified that employers do not need to provide reasonable accommodation to employees who are regarded as being disabled. The ADA does not require an organization to hire or give preference to the disabled, only that the disabled be given an equal chance and that reasonable attempts be made to accommodate their disabilities. Although there are no guidelines regarding what is “reasonable,” accommodations can include providing readers or interpreters, modifying work schedules or equipment, and making facilities more accessible. In spite of the fact that two-thirds of accommodations cost less than $ (Cohen, ), many employees are reluctant to ask for, and many organizations are reluctant to pro- vide, accommodations (Baldridge & Veiga, ).

In an interesting case demonstrating that many organizations do not comply with the spirit of the ADA, in  a jury awarded $ million to Dale Alton, an applicant for a customer service position who asked EchoStar Communications to accommodate his blindness by providing him with a computer program, Job Access with Speech (JAWS), that translates text into speech. When Alton first applied for the job, EchoStar told him not to bother because the company was “not set up to handle blind people.”

If a disability keeps a person from performing the “essential functions” of a job identified during a job analysis or poses a direct threat to her own or others’ safety, the person does not have to be hired or retained (Zink, ). Furthermore, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that an organization is not required to make significant changes in the essential functions of a job to accommodate a disabled employee (Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Services, ). For example, in Caston v. Trigon Engineering (), a district court ruled that a woman with  personalities was unable to perform her job as an environmental engineer. In another case (DiPompo v. West Point, ), a district court ruled that a dys- lexic applicant, though considered disabled, was not able to perform essential job functions such as inspecting vehicles and buildings for the presence of dangerous materials and recording information such as work schedules and emergency calls. In Calef v. Gillette Company (), the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that

although Fred Calef had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, his threatening behavior and inability to handle his anger was not protected. In Ethridge v. State of Alabama (), a district court ruled that a police applicant with restricted use of his right hand could not perform the essential job functions because he was unable to shoot in a two-handed position (Weaver stance).

An interesting and well-publicized ADA case was that of golfer Casey Mar- tin (Martin v. PGA Tour, ). Martin suffered from Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome in his right leg. Because this syndrome made it difficult for Martin to walk on the golf course, he requested an accommodation that he be allowed to use a golf cart. The Professional Golfers Association (PGA) denied the request, arguing that walking is an “essential function” of golf, and thus, using a cart would not be a reasonable accommodation. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Martin’s contention that walking was not an essential function of golf and that allowing Martin to use a cart was not an unreasonable accommodation.

Pregnancy The Pregnancy Discrimination Act states that “women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employ- ment related purposes, including receipt of benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.” Simply put, this act requires pregnancy to be treated as any other short-term disability. For example, in Adams v. North Little Rock Police Department (), the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a police department discriminated against a pregnant police officer when the department denied her “light duty,” yet granted light duty to male offi- cers with temporary disabilities such as strained backs.

In the case of California Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Guerra (), the U.S. Supreme Court expanded the scope of the law. Pregnant women may receive better treatment than other persons with disabilities and cannot receive worse treatment. In , , charges of pregnancy discrimination were filed with the EEOC, resulting in $. million in benefits to the charging parties (Woodward, ). Many of the rights provided in the Pregnancy Dis- crimination Act have been greatly expanded by the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which will be discussed later in this chapter.

Vietnam Veteran Status Due to the large-scale discrimination in the s and s against soldiers returning from duty in Vietnam, Congress passed the Vietnam-Era Veterans Readjustment Act in . This act mandates any contractor or subcontrac- tor with more than $, in federal government contracts to take affirmative action to employ and promote Vietnam-era veterans. This law is one reason that veterans applying for civil service jobs receive credit for their military service as well as for their qualifications.
