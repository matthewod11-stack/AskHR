# The USACareers System

USACareers, based on the same data as HR Manager, helps employees to make informed choices when managing their careers. Several of the features in USACareers are identical to those in the HR Manager so that a consistent message is conveyed for employees and man- agers. However, the data in USACareers are for the employeesâ€™ own self-assessment and development. Managers cannot view data for an individual employee; therefore, employees can use the system without concern for nega- tive job impact. This system was designed to help employees gain a better understanding of the competency requirements for their cur- rent jobs and to help them understand the requirements of future career alternatives through assessment, training, development plans and activities, career exploration, and the availability of job opportunities.

This comprehensive system was designed to assist employees in a time when the federal government was reducing its numbers. How- ever, it also helps employers understand the competencies of their current workforce. The system provides the employer with reports that can be used to identify the overall results of the competency assessments, assisting the employer in workforce planning by identify- ing target areas of improvement.
