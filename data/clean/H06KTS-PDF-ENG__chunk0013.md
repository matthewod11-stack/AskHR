# Stay Competent, not Complacent

Even after you do all the above in making the best of these changes

around you, you may still be dissatisﬁed. Perhaps you feel you’ll never

be at par with your new peers and that instinct may even prove right,

which can compel you to ﬁnd a home elsewhere. Staying too long at

your company has disadvantages, particularly if you become resentful

and demotivated. Financially, you may be stuck behind new hires

because of “salary compression.” This means that since your company

knows the ﬁnancial return of attracting high talent, they are willing

to pay outside candidates much more than they give raises to current
