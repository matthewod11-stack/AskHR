# 2.3. Procedure

The research team used a qualitative content analysis approach to analyze focus group data to determine guidelines and content areas that should be included in the implicit bias and disability inclusion training to help HR managers to promote higher levels of awareness of their unconscious bias against people with disabilities in the workplace. The goal is to change HR managers from gatekeepers to enablers of disability employment. A set of 11 open-ended questions (e.g., “How would you change the content of the implicit bias training to be more useful to HR professionals when interacting with people with disabilities regarding employment opportunities?”) was prepared to facilitate the focus group process, and two focus groups (n1 = 10 and n2 = 6) were conducted to achieve saturation.
