## opportunities for inclusion and more holistic problem-solving?

Expectations can inform — even dictate — our decision-making process

because even when we’re looking forward, our thinking is shaped by our

past actions and perception of past outcomes. We often don’t recognize

that we’ve set expectations because we jump into the decision-making

process without making the implicit explicit.
