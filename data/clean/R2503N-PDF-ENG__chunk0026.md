## HBR / Magazine Article / Are You Really a Good Listener?

deliberate attention and eﬀort to avoid the ﬁve pitfalls we’ve described

relationships, foster greater trust, minimize misunderstandings,

and create opportunities for meaningful change. Don’t let haste,

defensiveness, invisibility, exhaustion, and inaction keep you from

becoming a better listener and leader.
