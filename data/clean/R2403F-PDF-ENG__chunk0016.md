## Perhaps the single most important piece of information that most

leaders lack is what turnover actually costs. When we’ve tested groups of

CEOs about this, we’ve found that they have no idea. Unfortunately, HR

leaders often don’t know either, or the ﬁgure they use is completely oﬀ:

Most cite the cost as $4,000 an employee, which is simply an estimate

of the marginal administrative costs of hiring a new person. It ignores

things like training expenses, new hires’ lower initial performance,

and the time coworkers have to spend interviewing candidates. If

leaders realized that the true cost of turnover is often a multiple of

an employee’s annual salary, knew what the value of the ﬁrm’s best

employees was relative to that of average employees, and understood

that 29% of people who have just been promoted quit (perhaps because

39% of employers routinely fail to give promoted employees more pay),

they would immediately demand changes. It’s one thing to tell leaders

that treating employees well is the right thing to do and that it supports

the company’s environmental, social, and governance goals. It’s another

to be able to add that the failure to do it costs the business in question
