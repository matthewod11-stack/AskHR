## HBR / Digital Article / How to Communicate with Your Team When Business Is Bad

See the good

As you tackle the hard issues, Eikenberg recommends reﬂecting on

where things are on track. Take a cue from improv and use the “yes,

and” framework as a guide. “Yes, things are chaotic—and we’re doing

good work,” she says. “You’ve got to hold what feels like two opposing

views.” When you recognize what’s working even amid the messiness, it

helps your team see it, too, she adds. (More on this later.) One word of

caution: as you zero in on the positives, be careful not to explain away

the negatives by blaming external factors like market conditions or a

down economy. “These realities can be part of the narrative, but don’t

let them become excuses,” says Lynch. “Instead, take responsibility and

focus on what can be improved.”
