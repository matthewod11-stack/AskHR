# Types of Third Party Procedures

As the popularity of ADR has grown, so has the number of possible third party procedural choices. Below, we brieﬂy review contractual procedures that are in relatively common use in business or community disputes as alternatives to going to court. Many of these procedures are also widely used for public-sector labor management relations where avoiding labor strikes is a high priority. While other procedures exist (10 different species of ADR, 1993), many of those are only slight variations in the procedures described here.

Mediation Mediation is a procedure where a third party assists disputants in achieving a voluntary settlement. While mediation was once thought of as a procedure most frequently used in industrial relations and international relations disputes, its use has grown dramatically in the last twenty years. Mediation is found in a host of environments, legal disputes, labor management negotiation, environmental disputes, family and divorce proceedings, community disputes, landlord–tenant disputes,

bioethics and medical disputes, and international relations (Moore, 2003; Slaikeu, 1996; Dubler & Liebman, 2004). In addition, mediation in its many variations has been a traditional part of some culture’s communities and societies for centuries (i.e., Rudin, 2002; Chan, 1997; Chia, Partridge, & Cong, 2004). Examples of mediation have been described or studied in such countries as China (Diamant, 2000; Wall & Blum, 1991), Korea (Woo, 1999; Kim, Wall, Sohn, & Kim, 1993), Malaysia (Mansor, 1998; Wall, Blum, & Callister, 1999), Thailand (Roongrengsuke & Chansuthus, 1998), Japan (Callister & Wall, 1997), and in cultural groups such as the Navajo Nation (Meyer, 2002) and Aboriginal Canadians (Rudin, 2002).

Kressel and Pruitt (1985) suggest that mediation frequently follows ‘‘stages’’ where mediators focus on different sets of activities. several ‘‘Stage’’ models of mediation suggest that mediators typically (1) begin with actions designed to establish a relationship between the disputants and the mediator (e.g., Kolb, 1985), followed by (2) an effort to build trust and cooperation between the disputants (e.g., Moore, 2003), and then (3) move to consideration of the substantive issues under dispute (e.g., Carnevale, 1986). It is in this last stage that proposals for settlement might be proposed by the third party and some pressure in the form of positive or negative incentives might be applied to convince parties to make concessions (see Moore, 2003 or Kressel & Pruitt, 1985, for examples of stage models of mediation). There is wide variation in how much attention mediators pay to building relationships vs. ﬁnding settlements (Bush & Folger, 1994). In truth, mediators can inﬂuence dispute settlement in many ways, for a mediator is free to choose the inclusion and sequence of stages that he or she wants in an effort to help the parties reach a settlement.

It is worth noting here that the procedure we call mediation is implemented in different ways by the ‘‘mediator’’ outside of the US cultural context. For example, in the traditional ‘‘mediation’’ processes used in rural China, the third party is often a village elder or state authority who controls the process and imposes a solution onto the parties (Peerenboom & Scanlon, 2005). As well, in traditional mediation in the Singaporean Malay community, the third party is a community elder or high status individual known to the parties who starts with airing of the problem or issues in the ﬁrst stage followed by an administering of punishment if there is an admission of wrong- doing (Chia et al., 2004). Such examples show that not only is there variety in the methods that mediators use to implement mediations within cultures, but also differences in the role itself and its scope across some cultures.

Of the different methods of third party interaction, mediation is generally the least costly and the outcome often produces considerable disputant
