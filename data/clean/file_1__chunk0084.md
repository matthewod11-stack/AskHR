Generally speaking, in this thesis I am interested in individuals’ perceptions. I study whether people are aware of gender inequality and the gender pay gap, and how they understand these issues. I do not study individuals’ experiences of gender inequality and the gender pay gap since this contains knowledge of or skill of gender inequality and the gender pay gap, which can be gained only through involvement in or exposure to them.

In this thesis, I aim to examine the variations in individuals’ and employees’ perceptions of gender inequality and the gender pay gap. I agree with Deutsch (2007) and Kelan (2009) that it is crucial to acknowledge and examine this variability, so we can understand the conditions under which change may occur. I thus move to the discussion of perceptions of gender inequality and the gender pay gap.
