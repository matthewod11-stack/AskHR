## HBR / The Big Idea / Everyone Deserves a Season to Step Back

Consider, too, the case of Chas Carey (full disclosure: Chas is my

husband). When serving as the deputy general counsel of the New York Oﬃce of Housing Recovery Operations in 2017, he was oﬀered a role in an upcoming oﬀ-Broadway production. After talking to his boss and

team about how he might make the opportunity work and still keep his

job, Chas was able to shift his hours to a nontraditional schedule for the

four weeks he was in daytime rehearsals and then, once performances

began, cut back on hours by delegating and deprioritizing while tending

to the most urgent and impactful work. After a four-week run, the

production wrapped, and he returned to his “real life” with gratitude

for the ﬂexibility and a renewed energy for the work. Over the next

three years, Chas continued to excel in his job and was promoted ﬁrst to

general counsel and then to acting director of the agency.
