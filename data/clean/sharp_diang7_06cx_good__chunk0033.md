competency model. A targeted model specific to sales managers was developed that consists of 12 competencies grouped into four categories.

A process was adopted whereby each sales manager was evaluated to assess strengths and developmental areas. Once complete, the sales director met with each sales manager to review the outcomes and create individual develop- mental plans to enhance each sales manager’s performance.
