# Engage in productive conflict.

Your team members, peers, and managers may not understand the

importance of your high standards and may be confused by your lack of

ﬂexibility when conﬂicts arise. Just because someone disagrees doesn’t

mean you need to compete — or shut down and walk away from

the project or conversation. Engage in productive, respectful conﬂict

and seek common ground with your colleagues. Remember that you

don’t need to win every disagreement. Pause, allow space for the other

person, and take your time in reaching a resolution. Approach the

conﬂict assuming your colleagues’ good intent and desire to see the

work done well.

It can be frustrating to have high standards that are not valued.

Consider: Do you need to be more ﬂexible, or should you go to a

company more aligned with your exacting standards? Either way, don’t

let your standards halt your career trajectory.
