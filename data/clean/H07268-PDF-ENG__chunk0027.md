## of a professional success story, organizations should formally and

informally encourage employees who have “made it” to share their

stories — and emphasize examples of times when they beneﬁted from

a helping hand, or leveraged inside information and relationships to get ahead or be more eﬀective in their roles. Publicly sharing these

experiences helps employees at any level envision a path forward for

themselves in which politics plays a positive role.

Oﬃce politics has long served as a mechanism for exclusion — but it

doesn’t have to. While the negative impact of toxic politics on ethnic

minorities and women in the workplace is well known, our research

shows that it is possible to build inclusive political cultures, in which

politics are instead leveraged for common good. With a thoughtful,

inclusive approach, organizations can help all their employees engage

and reap the beneﬁts of oﬃce politics.
