# longitudinal extensions of

The changing-subjects and changing-tasks models are more metaphorical than theoretical. They present two explanations as to why job performance changes with time, but otherwise do not provide the type of propositions requisite of a theory. However, when considering the longitudinal extension of static performance models, the changing-subjects and changing-tasks models facilitate the discussion of the types of effects that longitudinal models can detect, and they help present a structure for framing the discussion of any effects that are discovered.

The stage models provide clariﬁcation of the sort of variables that should affect performance change. Ackerman’s and Murphy’s works highlight that the effects associated with abilities should change with time. Previous research has already identiﬁed a number of factors that can be incorporated into these models (Steele-Johnson et al., 2000). Longitudinal applications of static performance models and approaches to modeling performance trends will reveal ways in which such effects should be observed and which additional variables should be considered. A stream of research, utilizing
