When the oﬀender is personally in a crisis — and particularly one that

is outside of their control — other employees think being lenient is

the right, compassionate thing to do. Their compassion guides them

to feel that the manager’s leniency is more appropriate, which lessens

their desire to punish the manager for it. However, if observers do not

believe oﬀenders are deserving of compassion, their contempt bolsters

the unfairness of the leniency, fueling their need to punish the manager

for being lenient.
