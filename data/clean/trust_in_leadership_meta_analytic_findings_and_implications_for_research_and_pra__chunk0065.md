(.68 vs. .54). There was no significant difference in the relation- ships of trust with distributive justice or interactional justice.

For all variables, with the exception of OCB altruism, the moderators were not significantly correlated, thus suggesting that they are somewhat independent. Because the moderators were correlated for OCB altruism, it is difficult to determine whether an observed effect (or lack of effect) is due to one moderator or the other. Readers should therefore use caution in drawing con- clusions about the effect of the moderators on the trust–altruism relationship.
