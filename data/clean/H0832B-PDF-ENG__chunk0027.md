## Senior Director of SAP Alumni Relations, shares, “We customize content

for a variety of groups including executive alumni, ‘early talent’ alumni

who are at the start of their careers, alumni in speciﬁc geographical

regions, retirees, and recent leavers. The possibilities for targeted

communication are unlimited, and this is a critical factor for successful

connection with our alumni community.” Another targeted alumni

communication strategy is monitoring alumni milestones such as a

“one-year since exit” anniversary. Aligning communications with these

kinds of alumni milestones may be particularly important, as research

suggests reaching out one year after exit may be the best time to check

in about returning to the organization.
