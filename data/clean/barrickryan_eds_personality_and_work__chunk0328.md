# Motives

One type of motive that has been extensively studied is job atti- tudes. Job attitudes tend to be more strongly related to OCB than are personality variables (Podsakoff et al., 2000), leading Organ and Ryan (1995) to conclude that the relationship between per- sonality and OCB is probably mediated by attitudes such as job sat- isfaction, organizational commitment, and fairness perceptions. Many studies have shown relationships between personality vari- ables and job attitudes (for example, Judge & Bono, 2001; Judge, Higgins, Thoresen, & Barrick, 1999).

Rioux and Penner (2001) developed a scale to measure mo- tives for engaging in OCB and identiﬁed three motives through factor analysis: prosocial values, organizational concern, and im- pression management. They administered this scale and other measures to a sample of city government employees and obtained self-, peer, and supervisor ratings on ﬁve aspects of OCB. For peer ratings, the prosocial values motive was signiﬁcantly related to the altruism and civic virtue dimensions of OCB, and the organiza- tional concern motive was signiﬁcantly related to civic virtue. These two motives also accounted for signiﬁcant unique variance in these dimensions beyond that accounted for by measures of personality, perceived organizational justice, and positive mood. Two person- ality variables from the Prosocial Personality Battery (Penner, Fritzsche, Craiger, & Freifeld, 1995) were included in this study. Other-oriented empathy correlated .46 with prosocial values and .27 with organizational concern. Helpfulness correlated .31 with
