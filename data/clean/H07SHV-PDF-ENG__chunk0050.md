is a real thing. There’s a really great study, Adi, more or less in

our neighborhood, they’re called the Framingham Heart Study from

Framingham, Massachusetts. It looks over 50 years. It was set up to look

at people’s lives, at how diﬀerent social aspects of life are contagious

for physical stuﬀ, whether obesity is socially contagious, etc. But they

started to look at other things like happiness, and they found that just

your spouse get happier makes you happier. Having your best friend get

happier makes you a lot happier.

looks bummed all the time. And that’s because it’s like, “Oh, that

sucks. Everything sucks.” You don’t want that because that’s so socially

contagious that your kid is going to become unbelievably negative and

become sad. And nobody wants this for their children because they

have a sense of the social contagion.

The number one issue that I see in family dynamics is a social contagion

of negativity. That’s what each one of us has to turn around, is to try

to inject the happiness virus into our family and to basically do it on
