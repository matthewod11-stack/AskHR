# Penalties/Sanctions

The Mine Act established a maximum penalty of $10,000 per violation against mine operators for violations

found and cited. As a result of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, the maximum was increased to $55,000. The MINER Act amended section 110 of the Mine Act raising the maximum civil penalty to

$220,000 for violations that are deemed to be ﬂagrant. In addition, the MINER Act established minimum

penalties of $2,000 and $4,000 for unwarrantable failure violations, and increased penalties for operators who

fail to timely notify MSHA of certain accidents.

On March 22, 2007, MSHA published a ﬁnal rule amending 30 CFR Part 100 to implement the MINER Act provisions and to increase the penalties across the board from the existing regulations. Under the amended

30 CFR Part 100, all violations (including non-serious violations) are assessed using a formula that

incorporates six criteria set forth in sections 105(b) and 110(i) of the Mine Act. These criteria are:

i. The appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business of the operator charged;

ii. The operator's history of previous violations; iii. Whether the operator was negligent;
