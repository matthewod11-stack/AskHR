# INTRODUCTION

Human Factors and Ergonomics, often referred to as HF&E or simply ergonomics, is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses the study of how humans interact with systems, products, and environments. It focuses on optimizing these interactions to enhance performance, safety, comfort, and overall well-being. The overarching goal of HF&E is to create a harmonious relationship between humans and the various systems they encounter in their daily lives, ranging from workplace environments and consumer products to transportation systems and digital interfaces. At its core, HF&E seeks to understand the capabilities and limitations of the human body and mind. This knowledge is then applied to design systems, products, and environments that cater to human needs and abilities. By doing so, HF&E aims to minimize errors, reduce fatigue, and improve overall user satisfaction. In essence, it strives to make the world a more user-friendly place [1], [2].

One of the fundamental aspects of HF&E is the study of human anatomy, physiology, and psychology. Understanding the intricacies of the human body and mind is crucial in designing systems that accommodate these aspects effectively. For instance, when designing office chairs, ergonomists take into account the natural curvature of the spine and the body's need for lumbar support. Likewise, in aviation, the cockpit layout is meticulously designed to ensure that pilots can access critical controls without excessive physical strain or mental workload. Safety is a paramount concern in many industries, and HF&E plays a pivotal role in ensuring it. For
