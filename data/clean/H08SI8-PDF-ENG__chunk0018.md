## technology. In the case of the iconic clothing brand Levi Strauss &

Co., updating the company’s approaches was as beneﬁcial as bringing

new tech onboard. “As an apparel company, we were rooted in a

‘perfectionist’ mindset,” writes Harmit Singh, a senior vice president and chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer at Levi’s. “Typically, we would take an

idea, plan for six months, create the ‘perfect/best’ solution, and then

continue to iterate for another six months or more to get it right before

bringing it to market.”
