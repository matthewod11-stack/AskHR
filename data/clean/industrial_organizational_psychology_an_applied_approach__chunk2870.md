## Leadership through Vision: Transformational Leadership

In the past  years, it has become popular to separate leadership styles into two types: transactional and transformational. Transactional leadership consists of many of the task-oriented behaviors mentioned throughout this chapter—setting goals, monitoring performance, and providing a consequence to success or failure. Transactional leadership is thought to have three dimensions: contingent reward, management by exception–active, and management by exception–passive. The contingent reward dimension refers to leaders who reward followers for engaging in desired activity. Management by exception–active refers to leaders who actively monitor performance and take corrective action when needed. Management by exception–passive refers to leaders who do not actively monitor follower behavior and who take corrective action only when problems are serious.

Transformational leadership focuses on changing or transforming the goals, values, ethics, standards, and performance of others (Northouse, ). Transformational leaders are often labeled as being “visionary,” “charismatic,” and “inspirational.” They lead by developing a vision, changing organizations to fit this vision, and motivating employees to reach the vision or long-term goal. Transfor- mational leaders are confident, have a need to influence others, and hold a strong attitude that their beliefs and ideas are correct (Bryman, ). They innovate, challenge the status quo, focus on people, are flexible, look to the future, carefully analyze problems, and trust their intuition (Bass, ; Nanus, ; Yukl, ). Transactional leadership is most related to the personality dimension of extraver- sion; is positively related to agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience; and is negatively related to neuroticism (Bono & Judge, ).

It is believed that there are three highly related dimensions to transformational leadership: charisma (idealized influence, inspirational motivation), intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. Charisma refers to leaders with high moral and ethical standards who have a strong vision of where they want their fol- lowers to go and who use enthusiasm to motivate their followers. Intellectual stim- ulation refers to leaders who encourage change and open thinking, challenge the status quo, and appreciate diversity. Individual consideration refers to leaders who encourage individual growth and take the time to mentor and coach their followers. A good example of a transformational leader is Herb Kelleher, the CEO who turned Southwest Airlines into one of the top airlines in the world. Kelleher is charismatic (on one occasion he settled a dispute by arm wrestling, on another he came to work dressed as Elvis), employee oriented (his employees come first, the customers second), visionary (his concept of a low-cost airline was designed to compete as much with ground transportation as with other airlines), and a great motivator of people.

Interestingly, the meta-analysis by Eagly et al. () found that female lead- ers engaged in transformational behaviors slightly more often than male l eaders. Though male leaders generally engage in more transactional and laissez-faire leadership behaviors than do female leaders, women are more likely to use reward to motivate employees.

Yukl () offered the following guidelines for transformational leadership:

Develop a clear and appealing vision. Develop a strategy for attaining the vision. Articulate and promote the vision. Act confident and optimistic. Express confidence in followers. Use early success in small steps to build confidence. Celebrate successes. Use dramatic, symbolic actions to emphasize key values. Lead by example. Create, modify, or eliminate such cultural forms as symbols, slogans, and ceremonies.

The research on transformational leadership has yielded positive results. The meta-analysis by Judge, Piccolo, and Ilies () found strong correlations between transformational leadership and several aspects of leader effectiveness, such as follower satisfaction, follower motivation, and group performance. Fur- ther research on transformational leadership suggests that it is used on every continent and is best liked by employees (Bass, ).

After studying a variety of successful and unsuccessful leaders, Hunt and Laing () concluded that too much effort has been expended in trying to label leaders as “transformational” or “charismatic.” Instead, they proposed that excellent leadership should be defined by exemplar—that is, does a leader have characteristics similar to successful leaders and dissimilar to unsuccessful lead- ers? Support for this notion comes from the meta-analysis by Judge et al. (), which, although supporting the effectiveness of transformation leadership, found similar results for transactional leadership.

On the basis of their research, Hunt and Laing () hypothesized that good leaders possess five characteristics not shared by poor leaders: vision, differentia- tion, values, transmission, and flaws.

Vision Consistent with the notion of transformational leadership, good leaders have a vision of where they want the organization to go and provide direction toward that end. Hunt and Laing () found that % of high-performing leaders were described by their subordinates as being visionary compared with only % of the least successful leaders.

Diff erentiation Successful leaders are somehow different from their followers. In some cases, the difference might be one of personality; in others, it might be one of cha- risma, knowledge, or skill. Though successful leaders are somehow different from their followers, they are also similar enough to relate to and empathize with them. A good example of this can be found in presidential elections. Can- didates travel the country trying to relate to the people by wearing regional attire (e.g., cowboy hats in Texas, a John Deere cap in Iowa) but still trying to “look presidential.”

Values Successful leaders have strong values. For example, Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton strongly valued customer service, whereas Southwest Airlines CEO Herb Kelleher strongly values employee relations.

Transmission of Vision and Values Successful leaders are able to communicate their vision and values to others. In a study of speeches given by U.S. presidents, it was found that presidents who com- municated their messages using imagery were considered more charismatic and had higher ratings of “greatness” than presidents who engaged in content-based rhetoric (Emrich, Brower, Feldman, & Garland, ).

Flaws Interestingly, successful leaders typically have a major flaw and they know it. This flaw makes the leader more human and provides a target that followers can focus on when they are upset with the leader. A look at recent presidents shows many with flaws: Jimmy Carter “lusted in his heart,” Ronald Reagan tended to ramble and forget, Bill Clinton had his affairs (but didn’t inhale), and George W. Bush mangled the English language. Our attention to these flaws often kept us from criticizing these presidents on more important problems (e.g., ethics, economy, foreign relations).
