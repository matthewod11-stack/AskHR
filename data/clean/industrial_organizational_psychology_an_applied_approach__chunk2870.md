# Leadership through Power

Another strategy leaders often use is management by power. Power is important to a leader because as it increases so does the leader’s potential to influence oth- ers (Nesler, Aguinis, Quigley, Lee, & Tedeschi, ). Leaders who have power are able to obtain more resources, dictate policy, and advance farther in an orga- nization than those who have little or no power.

Earlier in this chapter, French and Raven’s bases of power were alluded to in terms of their relationships to Geier et al.’s IMPACT theory. These authors (French & Raven, ; Raven, ) identified five basic types of power: expert, legitimate, reward, coercive, and referent.

Expert Power As mentioned earlier in the chapter, in certain situations, leaders who know some- thing useful—that is, have expert knowledge—will have power. But there are two requirements for expert power. First, the knowledge must be something that oth- ers in an organization need. In a university’s psychology department, a researcher with an excellent grasp of statistics has power over those who do not. Similarly, a soldier who knows how to get around the military bureaucracy has more power than those who know only how to follow established channels and procedures.

Second, others must be aware that the leader knows something. Information is powerful only if other people know that the leader has it or if the leader uses it.

Legitimate Power Leaders obtain legitimate power on the basis of their positions. For example, a sergeant has power over a corporal, a vice president has power over a supervisor, and a coach has power over players on a football team. Leaders with legitimate power are best able to get employees to comply with their orders (Rahim & Afza, ) but have low follower satisfaction (Rahim, ).

Reward and Coercive Powers Leaders also have power to the extent that they can reward and punish oth- ers. Reward power involves having control over both financial rewards—salary increases, bonuses, or promotions—and nonfinancial rewards—praise or more favorable work assignments (Ward, ).

For a leader to have coercive power, it is important that others believe she is willing to use her ability to punish; she cannot maintain coercive power if employees believe she is bluffing. Punishment includes such actions as firing or not promoting and the more subtle action of giving someone the cold shoulder.

Referent Power Another source of power for a leader may lie in the positive feelings that others hold for him. Leaders who are well liked can influence others even in the absence of reward and coercive power. Leaders can obtain such referent power by com- plimenting others, doing favors, and generally being friendly and supportive (Kipnis, Schmidt, & Wilkinson, ). Employees of leaders with referent power are most committed to their organizations and satisfied with their jobs (Rahim & Afza, ).
