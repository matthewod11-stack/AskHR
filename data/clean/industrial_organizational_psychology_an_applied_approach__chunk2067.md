# Timing of the Incentive

Research indicates that a reinforcer or a punisher is most effective if it occurs soon after the performance of the behavior. Unfortunately, if the timing of the incen- tive is too long, the effectiveness of the incentive to improve performance will be hindered. For example, a restaurant employee learning how to wait on tables performs many behaviors in the course of serving a customer. A tip is usually left by the customer after the meal, which provides immediate feedback about the

employee’s performance. However, if the tip is small, the employee is not sure which particular behavior caused the customer’s displeasure. Likewise, if the tip is large, the employee is unsure which particular behavior or behaviors initiated the large tip. Thus the timing of the consequence by itself may not be enough.
