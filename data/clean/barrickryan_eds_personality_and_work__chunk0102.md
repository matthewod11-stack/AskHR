## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 13

ical variable selection (for example, the ﬁve hundred English ad- jectives of highest frequency of use; Saucier, 1997) is representa- tive of that population. This makes it easier to arrive at defensible scientiﬁc generalizations about personality attributes.

As it happens, the structure of personality attributes as encoded in the scales included in current personality inventories may not differ markedly from that encoded in single person-descriptive terms. The higher-level factors from the Sixteen Personality Factor Inventory (16PF; Conn & Rieke, 1994) and the Revised NEO Per- sonality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992) are variants of the Big Five. Six of the seven factors represented by the scales included in the Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI; Hogan & Hogan, 1995)—Sociability, Ambition, Adjustment, Likeability, Pru- dence, Intellectance, and School Success—have been shown to cor- respond fairly well to six of the Multi-Language Seven factors, with Negative Valence (and School Success) excluded (Saucier, 2002). Of course, future inventory scales need not be limited to the con- tent found in lexical factors; lexical factors indicate necessary but not sufﬁcient components for an adequate representation of per- sonality attributes (Goldberg & Saucier, 1995). Lexical studies pro- vide a superb initial grid for personality assessment, but they are not the entire enterprise.
