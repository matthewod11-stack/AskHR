# Print a success message print("Files renamed successfully.") ```

Table 18. A prompt for translating code from Bash to Python

Read and review the code. Copy the output from the prompt and paste it into a new (cid:450)le:

(cid:450)le_renamer.py. Test the code by opening a Terminal window, and execute the following command python (cid:450)le_renamer.py.

NOTE: When prompting for (Python) code in the Language Studio in Ve(cid:457)ex AI, you will have

to click on the ‘Markdown’ bu(cid:459)on. Otherwise you will receive plain text which is missing the

proper indenting of lines, which is impo(cid:457)ant for running Python code.

Prompts for debugging and reviewing code

Let’s manually write some edits to the code of Table 18. It should prompt the user for the

(cid:450)lename pre(cid:450)x, and write this pre(cid:450)x in upper case characters. See the example code in

Snippet *3, but what a bummer. It now returns Python errors!
