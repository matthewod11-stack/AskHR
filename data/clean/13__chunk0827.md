elements of that system that are consistent with that expectation (e.g., physical threat, poor living conditions, lack of autonomy, etc.). However, in the sample joke, that expectation system is violated by the suggestion that being in prison might be better than being at work. It is then resolved by bridging the prison expectation system with another coherent but unexpectedly related expectation system: the concept that ofﬁce workers are often corralled into conﬁning, uncomfortable and depressing work- spaces. The humorous part of the joke resides in the incongruity established by the juxtaposition and subsequent resolution of the ‘prison’ and ‘workplace’ expectation frames.

Incongruity is not only manifest in canned jokes such as those analyzed above, but can also be identiﬁed in other humor phenomena such as humorous comments, quips, or witticisms. For example, the Hemingway quote from the beginning of this paper ‘‘They say the seeds of what we will do are in all of us, but it always seemed to me that in those who make jokes in life the seeds are covered with better soil and with a higher grade of manure.’’ In this multitiered witticism, Hemingway playfully contrasts the very serious topics of growth or success in life with the unserious topic of ‘manure.’ In this context, manure itself contains incongruity because while it is used to make things grow well, his use of the term manure rather than fertilizer in this context is clearly an allusion to the fact that people can sometimes be ‘‘full of shit.’’ In addition, at a higher level of abstraction, Hemingway seems to be making a serious observation that in order to be successful in life, you can not take life too seriously.
