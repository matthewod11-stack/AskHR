In August 1940, as his country prepared for waves of attacks by German

planes, Britain’s prime minister, Winston Churchill, set out to address

a diﬀerent enemy: lengthy reports. In his 234-word “Brevity” memo,

he implored the members of his war cabinet and their staﬀs to “see

to it that their reports are shorter.” Churchill urged them to write

“short, crisp paragraphs,” to move complex arguments or statistics to appendices, and to stop using “oﬃcialese jargon.”
