## 4.3. Consideration of multiple learning modalities

With the transition to the digital world of work and the rise of social media technologies, content developers of implicit bias and disability inclusion training must earnestly consider the learning styles of HR managers. Findings included in the third theme specifically point to the need of visual learners. Visual learners are the most common type of learners, making up 65% of the people in the United States. They absorb information best when they can visualize ideas and relationships, and maps, charts, diagrams, photographs, animation, and videos work well for visual learners (Digital Humans, 2023).

Previous research in the field of cognitive psychology further supports these findings from the current study. Specifically, research highlights the instructional benefits of interactive videos as compared to non-interactive instruction. The use of interactive videos allows learners to acquire knowledge and skills at a faster pace than non-interactive learning strategies (Ho et al., 2023; Schwan & Riempp, 2004). Similar research reported the benefits of visualizations when presenting new information. Participants were able to generate more conclusions from information presented using visualization, as compared to text-only
