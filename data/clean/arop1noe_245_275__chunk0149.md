# Work Environment

Beginning with contextual factors, we specifically review recent evidence regarding the impact of culture and climate, team structures, job characteristics, and job crafting in facilitating workplace learning.

Culture/climate. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of a supportive learning culture in facilitating engagement in learning and knowledge-sharing behaviors. Choi & Jacobs (2011) found that a supportive learning environment had a significant positive indirect effect on informallearningthroughitsinfluenceonemployees’participationinformallearningcoursesand programs. A supportive learning culture also has apositive and direct influence on team outcomes such as creativity and collaborative knowledge creation practices as well as an indirect effect on team performance (Yoon et al. 2010).

Research has also focused on the role of psychological safety for facilitating learning. Estab- lishing a safe climate is important for learners’ willingness to try new things, take risks, or oth- erwise step out of their comfort zones without fear of negative repercussions for errors (Noe et al. 2010). Kostopoulos & Bozionelos (2011) found psychological safety to be linearly and non- linearly related to team exploitative and exploratory learning, respectively; exploratory and exploitative learning were additively related to team performance and mediated the relationship between psychological safety and performance.

Only one study has examined the effects of climate on work–family balance, specifically the moderating role of work–family conciliation, the degree to which an organization creates con- ditions for employees to reconcile their work and family lives, on the relationship between op- portunities for learning and development and well-being (Rego & Cunha 2009). The study’s results showed that when work–family conciliation was low, opportunities for learning and developmentdidnotleadtogreaterwell-being.Studiesbasedonconservationofresourcestheory, whichaddressesthebalancebetweenone’sresourcesandthedemandsthatrequirethoseresources (Hobfoll 1989), may be a useful starting point for future research in this area.

Teams. A team work structure can facilitate learning simply through member–member inter- actions. Kostopoulos et al. (2013) developed and tested a model in which learning originated in individual intuitions, was amplified through interpretation and integration, and manifested itself at the team level via the codification of collective cognition and action to affect team performance. Erhardt (2011) provided a typology of team-based knowledge work (TBKW) to describe specific processes of working with knowledge: teamwork that requires knowledge sharing(Gilson&Shalley2004),knowledgecreation(Jordanetal.2009),andongoinglearning (Raelin 2001). Four types of TBKW were delineated—standardized, modular, integrative, and collaborative—based on the structure of the team’s tasks or problems (ill- versus well-structured) and knowledge composition (heterogeneous versus homogeneous) within the team. These different types of TBKW require different types of knowledge processing and sharing within the team.

Fang et al. (2010) examined structure as a mechanism for balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. They concluded that moderate levels of cross-team linking lead to the highest equilibrium performance by enabling superior ideas to diffuse across teams without reducing organizational diversity. Andres (2011) found face-to-face collaboration to be superior to technology-mediated collaboration in facilitating team-level cognitive functions such as team learning, team reflexivity, and shared mental model development.
