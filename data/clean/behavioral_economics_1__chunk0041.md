was therefore thought to provide a stiff challenge to models which assume investors have limited rationality.

But “behavioral finance” based on rationality limits has emerged rapidly and might be the clearest empirical

franchise success for behavioral economics (e.g., Barberis and Thaler, in press). One advantage is that theories

of asset pricing often provide sharp predictions. Another big advantage is that there are many cheaply-available

data which can be used to test theories.

Behavioral finance got its biggest early boost from DeBondt and Thaler’s (1985) discovery that

portfolios of “loser’ stocks (stocks whose market value had dropped the most in the previous year)

outperformed portfolios of winners in subsequent years. Their paper was published in the proceedings of the

Journal of Finance and immediately drew attention and counterargument. Note that DeBondt and Thaler

predicted this anomaly, based on the idea that investors would be surprised by reversion to the mean in
