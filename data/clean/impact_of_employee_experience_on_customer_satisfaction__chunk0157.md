## ▪ 9 – 10 – Promoters: typical for loyal and enthusiastic customers

▪ 7 – 8 – Passives: customers satisfied but not loyal

▪ 0 – 6 – Detractors: not happy customer, not loyal, probably they will not buy again

NPS does not take Passives into consideration, so we get the NPS score from

subtracting the percentage of Detractors from percentage of Promoters.
