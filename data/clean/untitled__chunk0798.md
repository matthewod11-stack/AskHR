# The 1921 Symposium

Probably the most well-known study of experts’ deﬁnitions of intelligence was one done by the editors of the Journal of Educational Psychology (“Intelligence and Its Measure- ment,” 1921). Contributors to the symposium were asked to write essays addressing two issues: (a) what they conceived intelligence to be and how it best could be measured by group tests, and (b) what the most crucial next steps would be in re- search. Fourteen experts gave their views on the nature of in- telligence, with such deﬁnitions as the following:

- 1. The power of good responses from the point of view of truth or facts (E. L. Thorndike).

- 2. The ability to carry on abstract thinking (L. M. Terman).

- 3. Sensory capacity, capacity for perceptual recognition, quickness, range or ﬂexibility of association, facility and imagination, span of attention, quickness or alertness in response (F. N. Freeman).

- 4. Having learned or ability to learn to adjust oneself to the environment (S. S. Colvin).

- 5. Ability to adapt oneself adequately to relatively new sit- uations in life (R. Pintner).

- 6. The capacity for knowledge and knowledge possessed (B. A. C. Henmon).

- 7. A biological mechanism by which the effects of a com- plexity of stimuli are brought together and given a some- what uniﬁed effect in behavior (J. Peterson).

- 8. The capacity to inhibit an instinctive adjustment, the ca- pacity to redeﬁne the inhibited instinctive adjustment in the light of imaginally experienced trial and error, and the capacity to realize the modiﬁed instinctive adjust- ment in overt behavior to the advantage of the individual as a social animal (L. L. Thurstone).

- 9. The capacity to acquire capacity (H. Woodrow). 10. The capacity to learn or to proﬁt by experience (W. F. Dearborn).

- 11. Sensation, perception, association, memory, imagina- tion, discrimination, judgment, and reasoning (N. E. Haggerty).

Others of the contributors to the symposium did not pro- vide clear deﬁnitions of intelligence but rather concentrated on how to test it. B. Ruml refused to present a deﬁnition of intelligence, arguing that not enough was known about the concept. S. L. Pressey described himself as uninterested in the question, although he became well known for his tests of intelligence.

Of course, there have been many deﬁnitions of intelli- gence since those represented in the journal symposium, and an essay even has been written on the nature of deﬁnitions of intelligence (Miles, 1957). One well-known set of deﬁni- tions was explicitly published in 1986 as a follow-up to the 1921 symposium (R. J. Sternberg & Detterman, 1986). R. J. Sternberg and Berg (1986) attempted a comparison of the views of the experts in 1986 (P. Baltes, J. Baron, J. Berry, A. Brown and J. Campione, E. Butterﬁeld, J. Carroll, J. P. Das, D. Detterman, W. Estes, H. Eysenck, H. Gardner, R. Glaser, J. Goodnow, J. Horn, L. Humphreys, E. Hunt, A. Jensen, J. Pellegrino, R. Schank, R. Snow, R. Sternberg, E. Zigler) with those of the experts in 1921. They reached three general conclusions.

First, there was at least some general agreement across the two symposia regarding the nature of intelligence. When attributes were listed for frequency of mention in the two symposia, the correlation was .50, indicating moderate over- lap. Attributes such as adaptation to the environment, basic mental processes, higher-order thinking (e.g., reasoning,
