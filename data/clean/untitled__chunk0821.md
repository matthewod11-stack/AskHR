# Holzinger’s Bifactor Theory

Holzinger (1938) proposed a bifactor theory of intelli- gence, which retained both the general and speciﬁc factors of Spearman but also permitted group factors such as those found in Thurstone’s theory. Such factors are common to more than one test but not to all tests. This theory helped form the basis for other hierarchical theories that replaced it.
