Table 2 provides an overview of TCS and Infosys' mean and standard deviation scores on

conformity and confrontation, respectively. There is no significant difference between TCS

and Infosys on both conformity (0.254) and confrontation (0.496) as the P-value > 0.05.

Essawi, and Tilchin (2013) developed the structural adaptive value confrontation leading

model to foster a constructive confrontation between intended corporate values and present

employee values as part of the leadership strategy of transforming corporate culture. Further,

Essawi and Tilchin (2013) initiating and directing the constructive confrontation that enables

responding to feedback through the sophisticated and adaptable use of diverse methods that

identifies confrontation as the latest organizational value, and the table demonstrates that

TCS and Infosys have no significant differences between confrontation and conformity

because, as per Gerard (1964), with confrontation, the people who choose to submit to others

do so more frequently than in situations without confrontation. So, it is possible that such

scenarios did not occur in both institutions, resulting in a negligible difference between
