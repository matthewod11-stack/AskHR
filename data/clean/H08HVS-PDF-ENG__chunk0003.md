California’s department of motor vehicles was a mess back in 2019.

The state’s then-new governor, Gavin Newsom, described customers

as “outraged” by their DMV experiences. It could take several hours

to complete simple tasks like renewing a driver’s license. Ancient IT

systems meant many transactions that could have been automated were

dismal, in-person ordeals. Silos and mistrust within the department

undermined collaboration and change. And frontline employees were

demoralized and distressed.
