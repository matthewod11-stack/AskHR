## Chapter 5 • Measuring Results and Behaviors

A second type of absolute system involves a behavior checklist, which consists of a form listing behavioral statements that are indicators of the various competencies to be measured. The supervisor’s task is to indicate (“check”) statements that describe the employee being rated. When this type of measurement system is in place, supervisors are not so much evaluators as they are “reporters” of employee behavior. Because it is likely that all behaviors rated are present to some extent, behavior checklists usually include a description of the behavior in question (e.g., “the employee arrives at work on time”) followed by several response categories such as “always,” “very often,” “fairly often,” “occasionally,” and “never.” The rater simply checks the response category she feels best describes the employee. Each response category is weighted—for example, from 5 (“always”) to 1 (“never”) if the statement describes desirable behavior such as arriving at work on time. Then, an overall score for each employee is computed by adding the weights of the responses that were checked for each item. Figure 5.3 includes an example of an item from a form using a behavior checklist measurement approach. How do we select response categories for behavior checklist scales? Often, this is a quite arbitrary decision, and equal intervals between scale points are simply assumed. For example, in Figure 5.3, we would assume that the distance between “never” and “sometimes” is the same as the distance between “fairly often” and “always” (i.e., 1 point in each case). Great care must be taken in how the anchors are selected. Table 5.4 includes anchors that can be used for scales involving frequency and amount.23

Table 5.4 includes anchors to be used in both seven-point and five-point scales. For most systems, a five-point scale should be sufficient to capture an employee’s performance on the behavior being rated. One advantage of using five-point scales is that they are less complex than seven-point scales. Also, five-point scales are superior to three-point scales because they are more likely to motivate performance improvement
