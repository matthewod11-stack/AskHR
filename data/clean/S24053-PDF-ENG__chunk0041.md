# Four Steps to Success

Top teams seeking to become more eﬀective can take these four steps.

- 1. Commit and invest. The ﬁrst step is to make a commitment that

teaming is a core skill at all levels of your organization—and that you

and your team will model the right collective behaviors. Your team must

make an explicit commitment to invest time and money establishing

and nurturing the ﬁve traits discussed earlier. Four hours once a year during the executive oﬀ-site won’t cut it, and funding can’t be patched

together from other budgets. You’ll need to secure resources and make

time on your calendar at regular intervals to work on capabilities so that

they become routine behaviors.
