# Purpose

Helping employees ﬁnd purpose in an organization is critical to

engagement and innovation. One way to do this is to ensure that a

company’s values are clear, actionable, and widely distributed. Tying

those values to key rituals is the perfect way to incorporate purpose into

employees’ shared experiences.
