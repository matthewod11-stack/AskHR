## 4.2.1 Implications for Addressing Performance Problems

The fact that performance is affected by the combined effect of three different factors has implications for addressing performance problems. In order to address performance problems properly, managers must find information that will allow them to understand whether the source of the problem is declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, motivation, or some combination of these three factors. If an employee lacks motivation but the manager believes the source of the problem is declarative knowledge, the manager may send the employee to a company-sponsored training program so he can acquire the knowledge that is presumably lacking. This would obviously be a waste of time and resources for the individual, manager, and organization in Janeâ€™s case because it is lack of motivation, and not lack of declarative knowledge, that is causing her poor performance. This is why performance management systems need not only to measure performance but also to provide information about the source of any performance deficiencies.
