feeling rather than simply listening.

Placating: You go through the motions of empathetic listening.

Position: You don’t feel that you and your counterpart are on equal footing.

Presentation: You put your own slant on everything.

Rehearsing: You focus on what you want to say next rather than what

you’re hearing.

Stress: You’re too distracted to listen effectively.
