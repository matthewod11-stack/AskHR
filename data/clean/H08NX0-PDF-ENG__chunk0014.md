## prioritizes performance, with clear goals and rigorous milestones to

ensure accountability, no matter where employees are working.

Rather than mandating a set number of in-oﬃce days each week,

Airbnb has structured its hybrid model around intentional in-person

gatherings. Employees work remotely most of the time but come

together for one week each month at the company’s San Francisco

headquarters. These gatherings foster collaboration and connection,

ensuring that teams have dedicated time to align on key priorities while

maintaining the ﬂexibility of remote work.
