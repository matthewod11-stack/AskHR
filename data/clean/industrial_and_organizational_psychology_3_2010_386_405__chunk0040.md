Brunswik, 1955; subjective expected utility models, Savage, 1954). The propositions of each model are carefully developed before- hand in terms of how the main variables relate to one another, and the research then focuses on how those models ﬁt various kinds of situations. The cognitive model of decision making is the focus, and the research on it follows a well-accepted research paradigm. Instead, research from an IOOB perspective often begins with an outcome of interest and samples broadly from different psychological models in an effort to explain the behavior of the out- come. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. The outcome-centered approach leads to addressing a broader set of problems and greater openness to multi- ple theoretic approaches. At the same time it is less likely to build a cumulative science from a program of research that progresses step-by-step over time. In the case of the JDM theory-centric approach, the science is more systematic but there is a tendency to limit investigations to only a narrow set of problems that can easily be ﬁt into the theoretical framework.

At one time, I was closely associated with OBHDP. It was, at times, frustrating because of the differences in approaches to research between the two disciplines. For example, on the basis of the number of articles published in the journal, it appeared the journal were more JDM- than as if IOOB-focused even though the numbers of submissions were similar. JDM reviewers shared a very similar paradigm along with a common evaluation perspective and were much more likely to agree among themselves. IOOB reviewers often had very different perspectives on the same problem and thus disagreed far more often among themselves. This disagreement lengthened the review process and often led to fewer acceptances than was the case among the JDM reviewers. This in turn had a strong inﬂuence on the proportion of manuscripts in the journal from each discipline.

In contrast,

In sum, the differences in paradigms are large and each ﬁeld can learn a lot from the
