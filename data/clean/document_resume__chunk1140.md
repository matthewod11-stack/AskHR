# Exhibit 4

An expanded approach is used for the Faculty position at Southern Union State Junior College, with Observation Stales to be used in conjunction with the Perfor- mance Appraisal Form. In this case, descriptiN e statements are written to reflect typical behaviors at each level on the five-point scale rather than just at the number 3, "meets standards" level. Therefore, a department head completing this form on a faculty member will need to read through the scales for each criteria to locate the description best suited to the observed performance. Parts IV and V of the Performance Appraisal Form are self-explanatory.
