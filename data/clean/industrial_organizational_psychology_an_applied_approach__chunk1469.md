was ., the average test score of the other  applicants was ., and the stan- dard deviation of all test scores was .. The desired figure would be:

. − . __________ .

= . ___ .

= .

The second way to find m is to compute the proportion of applicants who are hired and then use a conversion table such as that in Table . to convert the pro- portion into a standard score. This second method is used when an organization plans to use a test and knows the probable selection ratio based on previous hirings, but does not know the average test scores because the organization has never used the test. Using the previous example, the proportion of applicants hired would be:

number of applicants hired _______________________ total number of applicants

=  ____ 

= .

From Table ., we see that the standard score associated with a selection ratio of . is .. To determine the savings to the company, we use the following formula:

Savings = (n) (t) (r) (SDy) (m) − cost of testing (# of applicants × the
