# and management capabilities.

The model is most eﬀective when created as an active partnership

between a corporation and an external investor, as that enables

the accelerator to leverage the capital and resources at its disposal.

Typically, the partner will be an investment institution—and most

likely a private equity ﬁrm—because those investors have experience

working closely with large corporations. VC ﬁrms are less-ideal partners

because they are more interested in highly disruptive innovations and

prefer to manage the risk of such investments through diversiﬁcation.

Institutional investors tend to be passive investors and are not focused

on management in the way that this model requires.
