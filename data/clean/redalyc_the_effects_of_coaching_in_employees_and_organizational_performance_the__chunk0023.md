Consequently, the aim of this article is to provide theoretical support to justify the use of

employee coaching as part of human resource development and the effects of such coaching

on workers and organisations. We also seek to determine whether our theoretical approaches

are verified by testing the empirical model in a Spanish case. Achieving this objective may help

bring empirical knowledge of coaching to a level that is more consistent with its popularity.

Thus, our work will help bridge the current gap in the theoretical framework and justify the use

of coaching as part of human resource development. The current work emphasises the

importance of this line of research; the scarcity of previous research, as Carey, Phillippon and

Cummings (2011) argue; and the need to further our knowledge of the effects of coaching.

Furthermore, as Feldman and Lankau (2005) highlight, few theoretical studies examine how

and why coaching should work and under which conditions it translates into greater
