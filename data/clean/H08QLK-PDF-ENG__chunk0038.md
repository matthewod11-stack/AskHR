# Organizational Readiness.

Recognize that careers centered on workﬂow software—

implementation, customization, and maintenance—will evolve or

diminish. Administrative teams in HR, ﬁnance, and IT will shrink or

redeploy, freeing talent for innovation and strategic work. Suppliers,

investors, and local economies anchored in software services will also

feel these shifts. Change management, especially for the humans who

will be aﬀected and will need to adapt will have to be thoughtfully

managed to enable and accelerate the transition to AI systems.
