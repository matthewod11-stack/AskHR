## Chapter 10 • Reward Systems and Legal Issues

people do work for money and an organization’s pay level and pay structure affect productivity.23 On the other hand, people also seek meaning in their lives and need leisure time to pursue nonwork interests. Organizations that believe that money is all that motivates people are basically bribing their employees and will eventually pay a high price in a lack of employee loyalty and commitment.24

When we think about rewards, then, we should think in broader terms than just pay. We can define a reward as something that increases the frequency of an employee action. In other words, when an employee is given a reward, we expect to increase the chances that specific results and behaviors will be repeated or that the employee will engage in new behaviors and produce better results. If pay raises are not producing this result, because they are not meaningful or are given arbitrarily, then they should not be viewed as rewards. Praise and recognition for a job well done, without a monetary value attached, can be a powerful reward if such praise and recognition enhance the chances that specific results and behaviors will be repeated. Similarly, praise and recognition should not be considered rewards if they do not motivate employees to perform well in the future.

What can organizations do to ensure that actions intended to be rewards are actually regarded as rewards? What can we do to make rewards work? Consider the following recommendations:25

- Define and measure performance first, then allocate rewards.

Before rewards are allocated, there must be a good performance management system in place that (1) defines performance and performance expectations, and (2) measures performance well. In many cases, organizations believe that they have a rewards problem when in fact the problem is with the definition and measure- ment of performance.

- Use only rewards that are available.

If the organization does not have financial rewards available, then employee expectations should be adjusted accordingly, and the focus should be on nonfinancial rewards. It makes no sense to discuss pay raises as an important component of a CP plan if existing budget constraints mean meager raises.

- Make sure that all employees are eligible.

In many organizations, top executives receive benefits such as profit sharing, stock options, executive life and liability insurance, invitations to meetings in attractive locations, and permission to fly first-class. Are these benefits truly rewards as we have defined them here? Do these incentives enhance motivation? In general, they seem to do so because they motivate lower-level employees to strive to become executives; however, what would happen if these types of incentives were extended to the lower ranks of an organization? What if nonexecutive members of organizations were also eligible for such rewards based on their performance level? By making more employees eligible for the potential reward, there is a greater chance that more employees will strive to become top performers.

- Make rewards visible.

Rewards should be visible to those who receive them. Rewards should also be visible to others, together with information about what needs to happen for an employee to receive the reward in the future. This recom- mendation applies to both financial and nonfinancial rewards. Nonfinancial rewards in particular are usually more effective if they are made public.
