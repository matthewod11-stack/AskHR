# Chapter Summary

In this chapter you learned: 7

Employees react to change by going through the stages of denial, defense, discarding, adaptation, and finally, internalization. Employees best accept change if the reason behind the change makes sense and the person making the change is trusted and respected. Change is best implemented by creating an atmosphere for change, com- municating details, making the change over a reasonable period of time, and training employees. Employees can best accept change if they speed up, take initiative, and spend energy on solutions rather than complaining. The five levels of employee input are: following, ownership of own product, advisory, shared, and absolute. Layoffs can be avoided by using temporary employees, outsourcing, offer- ing early retirement programs, and creating alternative work schedules. There is a proper way to conduct a layoff. Layoffs have negative effects on victims, survivors, the organization, and the community. Compressed work schedules and flextime increase job satisfaction and decrease absenteeism. Although shift work often is economically necessary, research indicates that it has negative effects on physical health, performance, and leisure time.
