intricate, it includes both theory and conversations with people of

varying racial backgrounds and economic classes who were laid oﬀ

in our lives is instructive, particularly when her interviewees try to

make sense of their jobless selves. She explores the diﬀerences between

those of us who live to work and those who have a 9-to-5 mentality and

Rhythm and Conquer Burnout When Overworking Has Become the Norm,

the executive coach Amanda Miller Littlejohn has a wonderful chapter

on what happens when we “repeatedly skip winter,” which is “the act

of not taking periodic breaks and getting rest after regular periods of

working.” We fear these breaks, thinking, “I can’t…disappear or else I’ll

be forgotten” or “I can’t aﬀord to be invisible.” But they’re vital and

should be embraced without consequence.
