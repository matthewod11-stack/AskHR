## Limitations and directions for future research

The study has some limitations worth noting. First, we focus on just two countries with a

small number of informants. This means that the findings might not be generalised to other

emerging market contexts or other African settings. This limitation opens an avenue for

future study to seek a much larger sample from multiple countries. Second, our study focused

mainly on underperforming workers which some firms might construe in a different way.

Such analysis would help to test the limit of our findings. Another area worthy of further

scholarly works is the need to examine the relationship between underperforming workers

and underperforming companies. It may be that a lack of decisiveness in dealing with

underperforming workers breeds mistrust and causes co-workers to underperform, thereby

undermining the business and precipitating failure. Such analysis would not only shed light

on human capital development strategies but also help to offer a more robust explanation of

the processes leading to business failure in emerging economies (Amankwah-Amoah, 2016).

It is also worth noting that local employment, labour and contract law also play a pivotal role

26

in curtailing managerial actions. In this paper, we largely steer away from such explanations.

It is also worth noting that shortage of top talent in developing countries also forces firms to

retain such workers even in the face of underperformance (Tosi, Werner, Katz & Gomez-

Mejia, 2000). Future research might seek to conduct a comparative study of such laws in the

two countries and beyond to help develop our understanding of the subject.
