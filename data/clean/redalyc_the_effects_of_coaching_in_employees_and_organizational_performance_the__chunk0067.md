# 3.2.5. Sales and productivity growth

We used three indicators from Carlson, Upton and Seaman (2006) to measure the effects of

coaching on indicators of growth. The first variable is “Growth in sales in the past three years”,

with a weight of 0.878. The second is “Productivity growth in the past three years”, which has

a weight of 0.774. The third is “Growth in market share in the past three years”, with a weight

of 0.818. The KMO test value for this factor is 0.775, the variance explained is 68.23,

α=0.746, and r=0.771.
