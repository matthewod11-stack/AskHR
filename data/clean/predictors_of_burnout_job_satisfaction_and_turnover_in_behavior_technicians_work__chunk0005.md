Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is a well-established treat- ment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD; Eldevik et al. 2009; Reichow 2012; Reichow et al. 2012). ABA has been found to effectively improve performance on measures of intellectual functioning, language, adaptive skills, and social skills for individuals with ASD (Eldevik et al. 2009; Makrygianni and Reed 2010; Peters-Scheffer et al. 2011; Reichow 2012; Reichow and Wolery 2009; Virues-Ortega 2010). Availability of behavioral providers to assist all those in need of services is an area of concern (Wise et al. 2010). Considering the intensive and one-to-one nature of ABA- based services, (Behavior Analyst Certification Board 2014; Eldevik et al. 2009; Reichow et al. 2012) as well as the latest reported prevalence rates of ASD, which estimate that 1 in 59 children in the USA are diagnosed (Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network 2018), there is an increasing need for behavior technicians, the direct-care staff that conduct ABA-based treatment.

Typically, ABA-based treatment is supervised by master’s or doctoral-level licensed and/or certified clinicians (e.g.,

Board Certified Behavior Analyst, marriage and family ther- apists, speech and language pathologist, etc.), who are respon- sible for assessing skill deficits, developing treatment plans, tracking progress, and adjusting treatment goals among other responsibilities (Behavior Analyst Certification Board 2014). Supervisors oversee behavior technicians, sometimes referred to as other titles (e.g., therapists, paraprofessionals, tutors, etc.), who are responsible for providing direct services to in- dividuals with ASD. Behavior technicians typically have high school or bachelor’s-level educations and are increasingly be- ing required to obtain certification as they gain experience (e.g., Board Certified Autism Technician, Registered Behavior Technician; Behavior Analyst Certification Board 2014, Behavioral Intervention Certification Council 2015). Behavior technicians are responsible for implementing treat- ment plans, which are developed by the supervising clinician. It is often assumed that behavior technician turnover is high; however, estimated rates of turnover for behavior tech- nicians have not been reported. Examining turnover rates in similar professional fields may offer some insight. Rates of turnover for community-based direct-care staff working with individuals with developmental disabilities (DD) have been reported as high as 70.7% to 77% per year (Mitchell and Braddock 1994; Seninger and Traci 2002).
