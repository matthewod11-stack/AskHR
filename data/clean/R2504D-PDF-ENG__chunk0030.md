# model for a lasting peace agreement.

When Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, in 2016, many

commentators expected to see another failed tech megamerger. Instead,

CEO Satya Nadella pursued an approach that would become a master

class in building positive peace between corporate cultures. Rather

than rushing to integrate the social media platform into Microsoft’s

operations, he took the counterintuitive step of maintaining LinkedIn’s

independence while carefully cultivating collaborative opportunities.

He established the Connected Apps initiative, which created speciﬁc

projects where Microsoft and LinkedIn teams could work together

voluntarily, allowing relationships to develop organically. Teams began

discovering natural synergies, from integrating LinkedIn proﬁles with

Microsoft Oﬃce to creating joint AI projects.

The result? LinkedIn’s revenues grew from $2.9 billion at acquisition

to $16 billion by 2024. More remarkably, LinkedIn retained its unique

culture while gaining access to Microsoft’s vast resources.
