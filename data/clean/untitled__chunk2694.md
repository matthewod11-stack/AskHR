# VERA S. PASTER

The shifting status of African American people in this coun- try has been mirrored by our changing positions in the pro- fession of psychology. It was not until the Emancipation in 1865 that enslaved persons could be taught to read except under penalty of imprisonment, ﬂogging, or other severe punishments. In the south, schools for slaves were out of the

question, and colleges were unthinkable. In the free states, there were a handful of colleges, including Berea and Oberlin, that opened their doors to black persons. After the Emancipation, in the former slave-owning states, colleges for African Americans began to be established by missionary groups (historically black colleges). Later, in 1890, the

government land grant acts provided states throughout the country with funds for colleges for their students. Many of these admitted African Americans. But except for the histori- cally black colleges which were located mostly in the south, African Americans have always had to struggle to gain an education in this country.

Even though psychology is a relatively recent scholarly subject in academia, it has been a prominent contributor to the country’s complex struggle with its attitudes about race. An index of the difﬁculties is the fact that between 1920 and 1966, the APA reported, the 10 highest ranking gradu- ate departments of psychology awarded just eight PhDs to African Americans, while during the same period of time these universities granted over 3,700 PhDs to others (Wispe et al., 1969). During the ﬁrst part of the twentieth century, there were no welcome mats for African Americans at the psychology department doors of the major universities (Jay, 1971).

Further, “respected” psychological research and the best trained psychologists used their studies, tests, and theories to “prove,” in turn, that African American, Hispanic, Asian, Mediterranean, and Irish peoples were socially undesirable, mentally inferior, and corrupting of the nation’s potential for advancement. This “science” included using African Americans as guinea pigs in the Tuskegee study, sterilizing “undesirable” young women, relegating members of some racial/ethnic groups to an “uneducable” category, and similar oppressions.

Considering this history, it is not a surprise that the inﬂu- ences of the racial/ethnic psychologists are directed toward challenging traditional “rules” like those for research that lead to invidious comparisons of African Americans to Euroamerican. Ethnic-minority inﬂuence also includes prac- tices that emphasize serving the unserved, understanding the stereotyped, and expanding the scope of the theoretical in- quiry. Following are two examples of contributions, led or inspired, by these previously excluded people of color.

The ﬁrst example is a primary prevention focus for a men- tal health center. The center was developed in a poor, work- ing class, mostly African American and Latino section of New York City. The idea was to use professionals and trained community residents to provide treatment and other services according to community need and priority. Some examples: dialogues between neighborhood supermarket managers and householders; legal advice sessions with volunteer attorneys; counseling older people at the sites of senior housing; tenant organization to force landlords to provide needed services like heat and sanitation; advocacy for children with the schools, and liaisons with the police. The management of the center was open to everyone who lived in the community
