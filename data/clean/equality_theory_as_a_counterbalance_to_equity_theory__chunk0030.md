# D. A. Morand, K. K. Merriman

superiors by title plus last name (Mr./Ms./Dr. Smith), while superiors used ﬁrst name speaking ‘‘down’’ (e.g., Bill, Mary; Brown and Levinson 1987). In contrast to this, many corporations (e.g., UPS, Hewlett Packard, Corning Inc., Xerox Corp, Mars Corp) have extinguished such differen- tial usage—through formal policies or strong norms of ‘‘universal ﬁrst naming’’ (Morand 2005), whereby all employees (irrespective of one’s formal title in the orga- nizational hierarchy) enjoy (and employ) the right to address one another by ﬁrst name. Here again, the ‘‘redis- tribution’’ of these linguistic appellations (the reapportion- ment of role-related linguistic rights and obligations) is amenable to conceptualization through a distributive and existential equality lens.
