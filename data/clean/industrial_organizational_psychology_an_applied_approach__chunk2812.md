# Organizational Climate

Another situational theory, known as IMPACT theory, was developed by Geier, Downey, and Johnson (), who believed that each leader has one of six behav- ioral styles: informational, magnetic, position, affiliation, coercive, or tactical. Each style is effective in only a particular situation, or in what the researchers call an organizational climate. As shown in Table ., the six styles are similar to the five bases of power suggested several years ago by French and Raven (; Raven, ).

Informational Style in a Climate of Ignorance The leader who has an informational style provides information in a climate of ignorance, where important information is missing from the group. For example, if a car containing four college professors and a mechanic broke down on the side of the road, who would become the leader? Almost certainly it would be the mechanic because he would probably be the one who had the most knowledge or information needed to solve the problem.
