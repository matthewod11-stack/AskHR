# Cultural Learning

Questions to ask yourself:

- What are the unwritten rules that would be helpful for someone

coming in new to our company?

- What insights into decision-making, collaboration, and working

together would help someone integrate faster?

- What are the culture-speciÔ¨Åc expectations or landmines that an

incoming leader needs to know?

- What acronyms are common in our company?
