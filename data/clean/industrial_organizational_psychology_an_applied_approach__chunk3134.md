Confront conflict as it occurs. Don’t wait, thinking that “it will go away.” If you have concerns with another person, speak to that person about how your feel. Don’t be accusatory. Just explain how you interpreted the events and then ask if you and the other person could discuss how to resolve the situation. Be willing to ask for mediation, if necessary. When two or more members of a group or team are in conflict, everyone suffers, and you get a bad reputation for being a poor group/team member.
