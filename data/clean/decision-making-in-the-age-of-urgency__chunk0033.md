decisions, n = 243; and for all respondents, n = 1,212.

decisions fast, executing them quickly, and demonstrating higher growth and/or overall returns from their decisions, relative to their peers (see sidebar “Our survey methodology”). What’s more, the data suggest that respondents at winning organizations are twice as likely as others to say their most recent decisions have delivered financial returns of at least 20 percent (Exhibit 4).8

Our research indicates that the quality and speed of decision making are both strongly associated with overall company performance. For example, having high-quality big bets can deliver substantial increases in the returns from recent decisions.9 The same is true of speed: faster decision-making processes and faster execution of decisions both link to higher returns.
