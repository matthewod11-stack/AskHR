# Team-based role descriptions

Lastly, instead of giving each team member a job description, some

companies assign individuals to teams that are given a collective set

of objectives, outcomes, and deliverables. It is then up to the team to

collectively decide how each member will contribute.

A well known example is Spotify, where employees are part of small,

cross-functional teams called “squads,” each of which has a speciﬁc

mission. Each squad autonomously decides how to meet its objectives

best, relying on collective decision-making and their deep knowledge of

each member’s strengths and preferences. The teams meet frequently

to discuss challenges, assess progress, realign goals, and resolve any

conﬂicts or bottlenecks that result from the task distribution.
