Most current corporate diversity goals are very diﬀerent from quotas,

which have long been illegal. Yet even lawful aspirational goals may

well be targeted in the current environment, even if they were carefully

framed to ensure their legality. Nevertheless, they may not be worth hanging onto, because these goals are often ineﬀective. One inﬂuential

study found that managerial diversity goals alone didn’t predict

increased diversity.
