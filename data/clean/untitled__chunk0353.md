## Postwar Growth of the Practice of Psychology 37

counselors within secondary schools. And, the selection du- ties that had occupied many in vocational guidance became more exclusively the property of industrial psychologists. In place of these activities, “psychotherapy” came to counseling psychology, initially through the writings and teachings of Carl Rogers, who trained many counseling psychologists after the war in “non-directive” counseling and therapy techniques.

The 1950s proved to be a decade of crisis for counseling psychologists. It was a crisis of identity, or at least role con- fusion. Counseling psychologists who previously garnered most of their identity as vocational counselors had been called on in increasing numbers to provide a range of services to military veterans both in hospital settings and community service centers. Rehabilitation took on a broader meaning, and in addition to vocational planning, counselors were working on general issues of adjustment with service person- nel seeking to integrate into the general society. Likewise, the role of student personnel workers in higher education began to focus more broadly on student adjustment.

Changes for the counseling profession in the 1950s were evidenced by several clear markers. “Counseling psychol- ogy” became the appellation of choice at the Northwestern Conference of 1951, a meeting speciﬁcally organized to explore changes in the ﬁeld and to make plans for the future. Out of that conference came several initiatives that affected Division 17, the APA, and the VA.

In 1952, Division 17 changed its name from “Counseling and Guidance” to “Counseling Psychology.” The Veterans Administrationestablishedtwonewpsychologicaljobdescrip- tions: Counseling Psychologist (Vocational) and Counseling Psychologist. In that same year, the APA began accrediting doctoral programs in counseling psychology, partly in re- sponse to a doctoral training curriculum recommended by a Division 17 committee (APA, 1952). The ﬁnal identifying component of a profession was added in 1954 with the establishmentofanewpublication,theJournalofCounseling Psychology.

It might seem that counseling psychology had arrived as a profession. Such professionals had an organizational home, a journal, doctoral training programs, and jobs. There were, however, continued difﬁculties in deﬁning the ﬁeld that led to a Division 17 Committee on Deﬁnition report in 1956 (Amer- ican Psychological Association, 1956) and a “crisis” report on counseling psychology as a profession, written in 1960. This latter report was initiated by the APA’s Education and Training (E&T) Board, which appointed a three-person committee to prepare a report on the status of counseling psychology as a professional specialty (Berg, Pepinsky, & Shoben, 1980).
