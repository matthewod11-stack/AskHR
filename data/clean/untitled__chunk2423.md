# EARLY DEVELOPMENTS

The ﬁeld of community psychology began formally at a con- ference in Swampscott, Massachusetts, on May 4 to May 8, 1965. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) invited 39 psychologists to attend the “Swampscott Confer- ence” to discuss training in community mental health, a rapidly emerging health movement. A major impetus for this conference was that Congress was directing federal funds to create new opportunities for mental health professionals to staff community mental health centers. For conference par- ticipants, the guiding question was, “What were the roles for psychologists in such centers?”

Rather than focusing on this question, something unusual happened at the conference. Participants shifted the agenda and instead discussed how psychologists could play broader and more active roles in communities. The conference par- ticipants advocated for a new ﬁeld of psychology on the

Many persons took the time to comment on early and ﬁnal drafts: Khari Hunt contributed to the prevention topics. James Dalton, Paul Dolinko, Jack Glidewell, Rob Jagers, Chris Keys, Don Klein, Murray Levine, Betty Lindemann, Thom Moore, Bob Newbrough, S. Darius Tandon, Susan Ryerson-Espino, Ed Trickett, Dana Wardlaw, Rod Watts, Rhona Weinstein, and Chris Wellin gave help- ful suggestions on early drafts.

premise that such a ﬁeld required additional roles than those present in the community mental health movement (Bennett et al., 1966; Meritt, Greene, Jopp, & Kelly, 1997). In the 35 years since Swampscott, community psychologists have continued to expand the ways in which psychologists impact communities through theory, research, and action.

With this chapter we will frame the development of the ﬁeld of community psychology in a historical and social con- text. The history of community psychology is not just a his- tory of professional developments but also a history of the interaction of social events and the development of commu- nity psychology. The evolution of community psychology has been coupled with events in U.S. history beginning at least 20 years before the ﬁeld was founded. In viewing the emergence of the ﬁeld, we will underscore historical events such as World War II, the growing malaise of the 1950s and 1960s, and the increasing discontent with the postwar ideals of economic opportunity, personal fulﬁllment, and happiness. We will examine professional movements such as the com- munity mental health movement and note expanding con- ceptualizations of mental health and the delivery of health services. We will also present a sampling of events in the United States that stirred the nation’s awareness of social problems, such as racism and sexism. These topics, in partic- ular, will illustrate how social conditions and social problems can serve as catalysts for citizens and policy makers to cope
