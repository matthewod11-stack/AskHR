# member’s engagement and retention.

Which pieces of a project might leverage someone else’s strengths?

If you feel uncomfortable handing oﬀ an entire project to someone else,

consider what pieces of a projects might require skills that your team

members are experienced in. You can identify these skills by observing

people in action or asking questions during one-on-one conversations

such as: “What kind of work makes you feel energized?”; “What do

you consider your greatest strengths?”;“What makes you feel most

accomplished?”
