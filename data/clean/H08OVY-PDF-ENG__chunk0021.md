# Focus on the future

When you’re disagreeing with something your boss has already done—

like pointing out a misstep during a client call—don’t rehash the past.

Instead, Wilding advises focusing on the future. She suggests saying,

“I’d like to touch base about that last meeting and discuss how we

can improve moving forward.” This shifts the conversation to solutions,

using the earlier situation as a “springboard to the future.” For example,

you could say, “Next time, it might help to clarify who’s speaking when

so we can both showcase the value we bring to the client.” And never

say, “That was a bad move,” Bordone says. “That puts your boss in a

crummy position as the bad decision-maker. No one wants to be there.”

Be prepared for defensiveness

Despite your best eﬀorts, your boss might react badly. So, take a beat.

“Even a brief pause can make a diﬀerence when you feel pressured,”
