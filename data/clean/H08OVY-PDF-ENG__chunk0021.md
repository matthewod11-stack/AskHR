# Appeal to values

When you disagree with a big-picture decision, Wilding suggests

framing it around your role and responsibilities. Try: “I want to make

sure this project succeeds and that you have all the information to make

the best call.” This shows you’re acting in the team’s best interest and

oﬀering your perspective in service of the larger goal. For example: “As

a product manager, I see it as my job to steward our road map and

ensure we’re prioritizing the right features. To do that, here’s what I

think.” Acknowledging your vulnerability can help, too, says Bordone.

He suggests: “Part of me knows a lot of thought has already gone into

this decision, but I also feel it’s worth bringing up my concerns because

we might miss something important. So let me share my perspective.”
