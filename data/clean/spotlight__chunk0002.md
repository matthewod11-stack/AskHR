# The Performance Management Revolution

The focus is shifting from accountability to learning. BY PETER CAPPELLI AND ANNA TAVIS

W hen Brian Jensen told his audience of HR

executives that Colorcon wasn’t bother- ing with annual reviews anymore, they were appalled. This was in 2002, dur- ing his tenure as the drug maker’s head of global human resources. In his presentation at the Wharton School, Jensen explained that Colorcon had found a more effec- tive way of reinforcing desired behaviors and managing perfor- mance: Supervisors were giving people instant feedback, tying it to individuals’ own goals, and handing out small weekly bo- nuses to employees they saw doing good things.
