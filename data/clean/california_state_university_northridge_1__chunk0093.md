# means.

In short, courts have ruled that employers can be held bound by their handbooks.

The exception to this rule is based on the use of adequate disclaimers that state, this is not

a contract and can be changed at any time by the employer without notice. However, if a

prior handbook exists without a..ny disclaimers, then leg::il issues :rn::iy arise. Failure to

print a disclaimer and notifying employees of any changes may place a company in the

same situation as ITT Cannon, being bound by its contents. The ITT case is the latest

development regarding an employee handbook, which was written several years ago

without a disclaimer. Furthermore, if certain procedures are spelled out a particular way,

it is imperative that they are followed accordingly. At the same time, a handbook can be

extremely instrumental in disseminating critical company policy, if well written and

reviewed by a human resource representative.
