Some companies are already moving in this direction. One national

retailer uses compliance management software to monitor non-compete

enforcement laws, updating its hiring practices as laws evolve. This

proactive approach ensures the organization remains compliant while

minimizing operational disruptions.

- 2. Standardize policies while keeping ﬂexibility.

Organizations must strike a balance between standardization and

ﬂexibility when managing diverse state laws. Standardized policies promote fairness and eﬃciency across company locations, while

successful strategy involves developing a core set of policies aligned

with the strictest requirements across states while creating addendums

tailored to local laws.
