# Communication is Key to Engagement

Many of the studies reviewed indicate that effective communication between management and employees creates greater employee

engagement, and that communication is a leading indicator of organizational financial performance. For example, a 2006 survey of British employees found that allowing workers the opportunity to share their views and opinions with management was the single most important driver of engagement and that when management keeps employees informed about what is going on in the organization it builds more employee engagement.22

Watson Wyatt Worldwide also conducted a series of in-depth studies to explore the link between the nature of management communication practices at companies, employee engagement, and the future financial performance of the business. A key finding was that companies that communicated effectively with their employees were four times more likely to have high levels of employee engagement than firms that communicated less effectively.23 Thus, greater employee engagement was associated with better corporate communication practices. In one study, the group of companies with the most effective employee communication programs (based on use of nine kinds of communication practices) had a 91 percent total return to shareholders from 2002 to 2006, compared with only a 62 percent return for the comparison group of firms that had communicated least effectively.23 Moreover, a significant improvement in communication effectiveness over time (increased use of more of the nine practices) was associated with a 16 percent increase over time in market value of the company.

The results of Mercerâ€™s 2002 People at Work Survey provide some insights into why better communication by management is related to employee engagement and company financial success.24 The survey queried over 2,500 U.S. workers and found that the effectiveness of senior management in communicating with employees related to levels of employee satisfaction, job commitment, and loyalty to the organization. When senior management communicated a clear vision for the future direction of the organization, fewer employees were dissatisfied with the organization compared to when senior management did not communicate its vision effectively, (7% vs. 39%, respectively); fewer employees said that they did not feel a strong sense of commitment to the organization (6% vs. 32%); and fewer employees said that they were

seriously thinking about leaving the organization (16% vs. 40%). Thus, better communication from company executives was associated with better engagement from employees.
