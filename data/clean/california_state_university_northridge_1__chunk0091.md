## The University Student Union, Inc., at California State University at Northridge

recently revised its employee handbook, since it was outdated. The union has a practice

of providing each newly hired employee a copy of the employee handbook. The primary

workforce of the union are students who worked part time, not to exceed 20 hours, unless

23

their particular unit had an exemption based on the hours of operation. Just like

employees in the corporate sector, they read the portions that pertain to their particular

situation or interest. For example, overtime, holiday pay, jury duty, benefits and other

issues. At the time the current Executive Director, Debra L. Hammond was hired, she

later formed a committee (comprised of student supervisors and executive staff members)

that would review the current handbook and prepare to write a new one. The current

handbook had a clause that had to be suspended immediately, that is permanent employee.

Before the correction, it stood in place that after an employee passed the

probationary period; they became a permanent employee of the union, entailed to benefits.

A newly hired employee was on probation for six months; before she or he could acquire

benefits or the ability to transfer to another depart of their choice. During this sixth month

process, the employee could be terminated, if the jobs duties were not canÂ·ied out

according to the standards. After the sixth month, the employee became a permanent

employee of the union. Permanent employee implies that an employee could never be

fired. A student employee reading this clause has a reasonable expectation of job security,

as stated in the handbook.

Aware of the legal ramifications, Debra made sure the committee took permanent

employee out of the handbook and made additional adjustments as needed. Also,

numerous other factors of the handbook were reviewed as to quash any possible legitimate

legal action taken against the union. The author determined since the currently

probationar1 period was six montl1s, and our semester was four months, it needed to be

altered. 75% of the student employees went home for the summer and or winter breaks.

24

The author rewrote the probationary period to be duration of three months. Three months

was sufficient for a supervisor to determine if the employee on probation was a suitable

match. Did the employee like his or her job and from the employer perspective, did he or

she cany out the duties assigned in an efficient and ethical manner. Also, within the

handbook was a section regarding layoffs notices, which occurred at the end of each

semester. In the university environment, most student employees went home or found

jobs near home, working full time. The change in probationary period now coincides with

the semester. This also allows for nonsatisfactory employees during a probationary period

to be discharged.

Previously, this study addressed progressive discipline procedures that are

contained with the employee handbook. As an operations assistant, assisting the associate

director of operations was responsible for the student-building manager. They are student

mangers that run the facility dnring the day, nights a.mi weekends in absence of foll tin1e

staff member. These employees had to versed in union policies and procedures. Once a

new manager was hired, he or she had three weeks to be trained, longer if needed by

existing managers. There was one employee during his training process that did not want

to follow the training program in place and on several occasions wanted to go against the

norm. His fellow managers, who were training him, stated he was not complying with

procedures we had in place that had a track record for producing excellence, efficiency

and professionalism. Based on the repeated concerns of his trainers, there was a need to

25

The authors first step was to speak with him and determine from his perspective

what was going on before any action was taken. After listening to the employee, the

author informed him he would have the opportunity to manager his own style after his

training has been completed. The author urged him to follow the direction of his trainers

and to learn the union's policies and procedures, which he did not comprehend.

Unfortunately, this did not work, the author spoke with said employee again a warned

him, should he continue to not comply with his trainers and his training program, a verbal

warning going to be issued. A verbal warning bad to be issued, which was documented as

a verbal warning and placed within his file. The employee was still within his probationary

period and continued not to comply with request in a reasonable amount of time made by

other employees in the union, which his interaction was required. Next, was a written

warning based on the infraction, which ended with the clause this may lead up to

termination. After this failed attempt to rectify the situatio!l..., the employee was issued a

memorandum of counseling; this was within the handbook as a tool for addressing

problems. Again employee continued to show disregard for procedures and policies,

therefore another written reprimand was issued.

The last phase of that process for his constant insubordination was termination.

Employee was still in his probationary period (the six month period, before the handbook

was adjusted). The author entered into a discussion with the Associate Director of

Operation, Kristen Pichler, about employee's performance and it appeared this was not a

suitable n1atch. An option to exterid the probationary period was entertained however,

based on past performance and insubordination, it was in our (union) best interest to

26

terminate the employee. Employee in questions showed no attempt to rectify any

problems addressed, so there was no reasonable expectation that if the department

extenuated the probationary period a behavior change would occur. No extension was

granted and he not was taken off probation to transfer to an employee without

probationary status. The author, consulted with the Personnel Director, Ana Snowden (at

that time) at each and every step to ensure the department had complied with company

guidelines and any applicable law(s). At the time of termination, Kristen Pichler and the

author met with the employee and informed him, he was he being terminated, which was

supported by documentation. Employee began to argue this was wrong and made other

remarks. The author began to counter those remarks and was stopped by Kristen, for fear

what may have been said could have a future impact.

The progressive discipline process was followed as stated in the handbook with

continual consultation with the perso11..nel director. With1r1 the ha.11dbook it clearly states

the union has the option to by pass any of these steps if the infraction is so sever it

becomes essential. Only once was a probationary period extend, when an employee had

made successful attempts in correcting the problems presented. The author had a

reasonable exception that the employee knew the job and the requirements and wanted to

stay. This employee passed the extended probationary period and later transferred to the

business services department, utilizing his business skills acquired within his major.

The union went above and beyond most organization in regards to handbooks or
