# Penalties/Sanctions

Section 601(a) of the LMRDA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to investigate "in order to determine whether

any person has violated or is about to violate" any provisions of the Act (except the Bill of Rights of Union

Members and amendments made by the LMRDA to other laws), and to "enter such places and inspect such

records and accounts and question such persons" as may be necessary to determine whether a violation has occurred. The Secretary may issue subpoenas to compel testimony or to obtain records and other materials

needed to complete an investigation.

The Secretary may ﬁle civil actions in Federal district court to restrain or correct violations and to bring about

compliance with the LMRDA. The embezzlement of union funds is subject to a ﬁne of up to $250,000 and/or

imprisonment up to ﬁve years. Criminal penalties also apply to other Title V provisions as well as to certain reporting violations under Titles II and III.
