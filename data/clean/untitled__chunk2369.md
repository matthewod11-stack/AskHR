# The Hybrid Years

York and Pennsylvania, other states began credentialing school psychologists so that by the mid-1940s, 13 states had done so. That number increased to 23 states by 1960, and per- haps 40 by the end of the period. Few of these states followed the two levels of training, titles, and practice recommended by Division 16, choosing instead to require training below the doctoral degree, sometimes to include a bachelor’s degree with additional graduate work or a master’s degree with spe- ciﬁc training, and in some instances requiring a teaching credential and/or experience. By the end of the period, how- ever, the master’s degree with training in school psychology was typical of credentialing requirements from state educa- tion agencies, and few states were requiring prior training as a teacher.

Credentialing for nonschool practice (e.g., community clinics, independent private practice) followed closely upon the success of the state education agencies. The ﬁrst psychol- ogy credentialing by a state board of examiners in psychol- ogy (SBEP) occurred in 1945 in Connecticut. By 1960, 15 states achieved this, and 40 states had done so by 1969. These laws tended to follow closely the APA’s expectations for the doctoral degree, with some states allowing the title “psychologist” at the master’s level. Most states employed the term “psychological examiner” or “associate” for non- doctoral persons and restricted their practice or placed their work under doctoral supervision. The differing requirements of the SDE and SBEP restricted or barred the practice of most school-based school psychologists in nonschool set- tings. This set the stage for numerous state-level conﬂicts in the future.
