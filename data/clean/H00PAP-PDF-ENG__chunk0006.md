I sometimes ﬁnd it hard to believe that America’s current immigration

systems weren’t designed by our enemies. More liberal policies

and streamlined procedures would bring technical talent and

entrepreneurial energy at a time when we clearly need them. Yet these

reforms remain out of reach.

Overwhelmingly, the best and brightest in the world still want to come

here to study, work, and start companies; a worldwide 2012 Gallup

poll revealed that the US “holds the undisputed title as the world’s most

desired destination for potential migrants.”

We make it overwhelmingly diﬃcult for them, however. As Darrell West

of the Brookings Institution summarized, “For many immigrants, it is virtually impossible for them to aﬀord the fees, handle the paperwork,

and navigate a complex bureaucratic process…. American immigration

is a 19th century process in a 21st century world.”

We’ve made some small progress recently but a recent bipartisan

attempt at comprehensive reform, which includes such great ideas

as a separate ‘startup visa‘ category to foster entrepreneurship,

is languishing in the house after passing the Senate last year.
