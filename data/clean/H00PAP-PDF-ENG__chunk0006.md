## HBR / Digital Article / The U.S. Immigration Debate Isn’t Left vs. Right

There’s a belief in some quarters that this reform will hurt low-wage

American workers (who are already hurting enough) by exposing them

to more competition from immigrants and thus lowering their job

prospects and wages. But the evidence is mounting that this threat is

at worst pretty small, and most likely nonexistent. As the American

Enterprise Institute (among many others) has found, immigrants tend to take diﬀerent jobs than natives, and so are not rivals.

I spoke recently at two events in California organized by FWD.us, a

tech industry advocacy group that has to date been squarely focused

on immigration (FWD.us covered my travel expenses, but did not

pay me anything). At the events themselves, and at the meals and

other gatherings around them, the accents varied greatly but the

stories didn’t. They were all about enthusiasm and love for America,

a deep desire to build a life and make contributions here, and intense

frustration at how hard it was to do this.

My favorite quote from the trip was from a very successful (US-born)

technologist who said that immigration reform was “not about the right

vs. the left; it’s about smart vs. dumb.”

Which side are you on?
