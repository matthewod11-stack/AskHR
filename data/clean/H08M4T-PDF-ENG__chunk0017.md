## HBR / Digital Article / 7 Habits to Stay Focused in a World Full of Distractions

Replenish your attention reserves.

Negative space, an art term that refers to the empty areas around the

main subjects in an image, oﬀers a metaphor for an essential focus skill:

managing mental energy. Just as artists use negative space to create

balance, you can learn to strategically recover your cognitive resources

by taking purposeful breaks, says Mark. “We tend to pack our days with

tasks,” she notes. “We don’t realize we have to build in time for when

we’re not working that will help us refuel.” When your reserves are

running low, give yourself permission to rest and reset. “But resetting

does not mean scrolling socials,” says Montminy. “Consuming content

is not taking a break.” Instead, she recommends stretching, meditating,

reading poetry, or taking time to stare out a window. “Give your brain

time and space to regroup.”

Recognize the value of your attention and make conscious choices

about how you allocate it, adds Mark. “You have limited cognitive

resources. They’re very precious.” The crucial question is: “How do you

want to distribute them over the course of your day?”
