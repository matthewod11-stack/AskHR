When we asked managers why they didn’t try to establish these connections, they often responded that the links were self-evident: Of course improvements in customer loyalty, em- ployee retention, new product introductions, or other common nonfinancial measures lead to higher profits and shareholder value. But unfortunately, our research indicates that such assumptions are often half-baked or wrong. Consider the fast food chain discussed earlier. Before creating its causal model, the company chose employee turnover as a key perfor- mance indicator, believing that high employee retention indicated a high level of satisfaction and motivation, which would in turn improve customer service and eventually boost profits. This set of assumptions led the chain to con- sider implementing a series of costly initia- tives, such as cash bonuses and increased bene- fits at employees’ one-year anniversaries, to reduce voluntary turnover. Subsequent analy- sis, however, found that the profitability of res- taurants with identical turnover rates varied dramatically. That’s because a 150% annual turnover rate at one restaurant could include turnover of cooks and cashiers as well as man- agement and supervisory personnel, while that same 150% turnover rate in another restaurant could reflect 200% turnover among lower-level workers but only 30% turnover among supervi- sors. What distinguished profitability was the turnover among supervisors, not among lower- level workers. The company was not wrong in believing that turnover was important. But a
