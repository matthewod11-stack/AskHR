5 The source that details the derivation, training of observers, proce- dures, and reliability and validity analysis of the observation system used tn the real managers study 1s Fred Luthans and Diane L_ Lockwood's “Toward an Observation System for Measuring Leader Behavior in Natural Settings,” inJ Hunt, D Hosking, C Schnesheim, and R Stewart (Eds) Leaders and Managers International Perspectives of Managerial Behavior and Leader- ship, New York Pergamon Press, 1984, pp 117-141

6 For more background on the success portion of the study and the formula used to calculate the success index see Fred Luthans, Stuart Rosen- krantz, and Harry Hennessey, “What Do Successful Managers Really Do?
