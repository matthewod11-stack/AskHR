# Look to Your Own Leadership Behaviors

As a leader, your day-to-day behaviors can inadvertently cause your

employees undue stress and anxiety. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic put

together a list of ﬁve common behaviors to watch out for. For example,

are you adding unnecessary complexity by making employees guess at

what you’ll do next? Are you telegraphing pessimism, leading them to

assume a situation is worse than it is? Being more aware of how your

actions aﬀect your employees can help you “bring out the best in people

even in the worst of times,” according to Chamorro-Premuzic.
