The reasons which influencetheintention of employeetostay in theresearchedorganization, with support of the open question, which contained a question made in the opposite way to the general objective of this research, this is, the responders might write in few words the reasons that leaded them to remain in the organization. The responders were separated in two groups made from the result of the variable turnover intention. The Group A was made by those who do not have intention to leave and the Group B by those who demonstrate a strong intention to leave. The responders who obtained an average between these values were not considered for the content analysis. The creation of these two groups had, as objective, to identify the reasons which lead the responders to stay in organization and compare the difference that exists between Group A (intention to stay) and the Group B (intention to leave).

The answers of these two groups were separately submitted to the content analysis with the technique thematic category. In total 214 units of registry were generated. Group A (with no intention to leave) generated 164 units of registry that generated 31 themes and eight categories, only eight participants of this universe did not answer this question. Group B (with intention to leave) generated 50 units of registry, 14 themes, and 7 categories, only 4 responders of this universe leave this question unanswered (Table IX).

It is worth noticing that many themes did not fit in the generated categories, as to Group A and Group B. For this reason, a category denominated “others” was opted for creating each group, which included several speeches. The percentage of these categories in both groups was significant (Group A – 23 percent and Group B – 26 percent), surpassing the percentage of the most cited category.
