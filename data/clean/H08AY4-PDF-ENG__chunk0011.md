# the feedback.

- You made a mistake in the feedback and need to ﬁx it.

This will make feedback easier in the short term when you can free

yourself from needing to get it perfect right out of the gate. It can also

make it easier in the long run, when your colleague learns that that

you’re going to give them the opportunity to share their perspective.
