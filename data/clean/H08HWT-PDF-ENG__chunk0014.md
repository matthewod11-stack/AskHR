There’s a saying that you’ve probably heard many times and will

probably hear many times more, “AI won’t likely take your job, but

people who use AI will.”

AI empowers you to take what you do today and make it more eﬃcient, more scalable, less expensive, and more automated. More so,

AI supercharges your capabilities to do what you couldn’t do yesterday

to augment your performance. It’s this part that requires imagination,

creative and repetitive training, and a willingness to step beyond your

comfort zone and explore the unknown (and have fun while you’re at it).
