# across the business.

Sadly, this is not an isolated example. In a recent CEO research study

we conducted, we interviewed a dozen CEOs of mid- to large-size

companies. There was one key challenge every CEO mentioned: their

frustration at not being able to get their executive teams to work

together. “I’m the only one who thinks about the entire company,” one

CEO lamented, “and despite my best eﬀorts, each of my executives is

only concerned with their own function or team.”

It’s long been recognized that cross-functional collaboration is

essential. Still, stubborn silos that bog down execution, hamper

innovation, and slow decision-making are still a common and persistent

challenge. In our work with company leaders, we’ve found that without

leaders working together at the top, silos and dysfunction are inevitable.

The onus is therefore on senior leaders to knock down these silos —

moving beyond their ability to lead their own teams to also prioritize

leading across the organization.
