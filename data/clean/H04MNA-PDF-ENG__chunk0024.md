# and my level of inﬂuence?”

Bystanders in the workplace can defuse harassing or oﬀensive language

or situations with humor, she said, or verbal or nonverbal expressions

of disapproval. They can interrupt a situation by changing the subject,

or inserting themselves into the situation. “If it’s the ﬁrst time you hear

someone say something oﬀensive, you might try humor as a way of

getting their attention, making a caustic remark, or saying, ‘What year is

this? 1970?’ as a way of getting their attention,” Sepler said. Even so, she

cautioned that bystanders must weigh whether the colleague has the

reputation for being a jerk. Another option bystanders could consider is

having a conversation after the fact, when tensions have cooled, laying

out why the behavior was oﬀensive.

For a harassing boss or someone who holds power over your career

or livelihood, where direct confrontation could be riskier, defusion,

distraction, or interruption are still possible tools for bystanders in the

moment. And after the fact, bystanders can also seek out a supervisor or

inﬂuencer, make a report, or help a target make a report.

At a minimum, bystanders can always show support to targets, who

often feel isolated, humiliated, diminished, and alone after a harassing

incident. “Going to someone and saying, ‘I saw how they were treating

you. I didn’t like it. Is there anything I can do to help?’ Or, ‘It’s not your

fault, let’s go talk with human resources.’ That might be all you can do,”

Sepler said. “That’s not nothing.”
