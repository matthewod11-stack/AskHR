measure of personal maturity, a construct reflecting self-efficacy, coping skills, positive assertiveness, and locus of control. Blinde and Greendorfer (1992) report that student-athletes find it difficult to interact with peers outside athletic groups. In addition, Spreitzer (1994) contends that the transfer effects from the playing field to the larger game of life receive little support.

In addition to the mixed conclusions reached by previous studies of the relationship between sports team participation and leadership development, the measures used in many of these studies also may be questioned. Some of the leadership measurement instruments used in those studies focused on leadership within a sports team, and thus may not be generalized to leadership in a different context. Other measures included self, peer, or coaching staff perceptions of the individual athlete’s leadership abilities and as such, the validity of the construct measured can be challenged. Sample size in many of the studies is very small. No previous study of sports and leadership has used a behaviorally based, validated measure of leadership.

The current study examines the relationship between organized sports team participation and leadership skills, employing a valid means of measuring several dimensions of leadership. The study addresses the following research questions.

Q1: Do organized sports team participants differ in their leadership skills from those who did not participate in similar teams?

Q2: Are increasing levels of participation in school-sponsored sports teams associated with increasing levels of leadership skills?

Q3: Does the nature of the sport have an effect on the level of leadership skills developed?
