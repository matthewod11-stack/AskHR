- Lack of Alternative Assessments: Many AI-driven evaluations assume a “one-size-fits-all” model, disregarding cognitive and physical limitations tha t require alternative assessments (Marshall et offer alternative al., 2024; Tilmes, 2022). Few regulatory measures require AI hiring tools to assessments, leaving it up to individual employers to implement accommodations as needed.

- Bias in Training Data: AI models trained on historically biased data continue to underrepresent individuals with disabilities, thereby reinforcing exclusion (Binns & Kirk ham, 2021; Kaminski, 2023).

Ideal Candidate Stereotypes: AI hiring tools often prioritize able-bodied profiles, forcing disabled applicants to conform to biased norms that overlook diverse competencies (Burrell & McAndrew, 2023; Sánchez-Monedero et al., 2020).
