# prospects.

Furthermore research has shown that multiple stars may not work

together smoothly, as they jostle for status and compete for resources,

ultimately resulting in the group failing to take full advantage of its

collection of exceptional individuals. As such, when hiring stars ﬁrms

risk triggering non-cooperative and even hostile forms of behavior

which undermine the integration of the star and the ability of the ﬁrm

to capture the full value of the move.

It is not surprising therefore that a lot of lateral hires (upwards of

50% according to some estimates) fail within a few years, with the star

moving to new pastures.

When does hiring stars work (or not)?

Our ﬁndings lend support to the arguments above, as they show that

in the ﬁrst-year post-hiring, those practice areas that hired star lawyers

have lower performance than comparable practice areas that didn’t do

so. This relative underperformance is approximately 10%.

Yet our results also show some variability in outcomes, including two

scenarios when hiring stars may actually work.
