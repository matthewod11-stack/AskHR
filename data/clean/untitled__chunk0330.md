# OF PSYCHOLOGY 35

There was a profession of psychology long before there was a science of psychology and even before the term “psycholo- gist” came into public use. In early nineteenth-century America (as in centuries before throughout the world), there were practitioners who counseled people about their mar- riages, advised individuals about possible careers, aided par- ents in the rearing of their children, advised companies about employee selection, and offered to cure a host of psychologi- cal illnesses through myriad treatments. These practitioners worked under various labels, including phrenologist, charac- terologist, spiritualist, graphologist, mental healer, physiogn- omist, mind reader, and psychologist.

Thus, there were individuals practicing in most of the venues in which psychologists practice today and offering many of the services that are provided today by clinical,

counseling, school, and industrial-organizational psycholo- gists. However, whether such individuals were “psycholo- gists,” and whether they represented a “profession” at that point, are different matters.

WHAT DEFINES A PROFESSION?

Originally, there were three professions: law, medicine, and the clergy. These ﬁelds of endeavor were distinct from “trades” in that they required highly specialized areas of edu- cation, created their own languages—generally not under- stood by the populace at large—and developed their own sets of practices, ethics, and so forth. As opposed to science, which traditionally published its newfound knowledge, pro- fessions kept their knowledge to themselves. For example, the priests of the Mayans knew by their sophisticated astron- omy when the eclipses of the sun and moon would be and used their predictive powers to ensure that citizens paid their appropriate taxes.

In time the word profession was not used exclusively for the three original ﬁelds but for any career requiring higher
