# economic organization.

Behavioral economics modifies the standard economic model to account for psy-

chophysical properties of preference and judgment, which create limits on rational

calculation, willpower, and greed (see, for example, Rabin 1998; Mullainathan and

Thaler 2001; Camerer and Loewenstein 2004). The modified economics theory aims

at providing parsimonious and psychologically sound explanations for empirical

findings that the standard model has a tough time explaining. From a methodolog-

ical perspective, behavioral economics is simply a humble approach to economics,

which respects the comparative empirical advantages of neighboring social sci- ences and sees neighboring sciences as trading partners. The empirical regularity and constructs carefully explored by those neighboring fields are presumed to be an

important input which should often trump the seduction of mathematically elegant

economic theories that are empirically unmotivated.

Thinking about organizations naturally extends the definition of behavioral eco-

nomics to include how socialization, networks, and identity shape individual behav-

ior in organizations (see, for example, Akerlof and Kranton 2005; Gibbons 2004b).

As such, the behavioral economics of organizations involve both a special challenge

and opportunity. Consider how behavioral finance has developed as an academic

discipline, and how behavioral organizational economics could develop. Until 1990

or so, finance was arguably the area of economics most hostile to the idea that psy-

chological limits matter for the focus of the field’s attention—-namely, stock price

movements. Since then, there has been a dramatic shift in the amount of careful
