over time, the methodological conveniences of job performance(results) do not overcome the fundamental differences that exist between job performance(behaviors) and job performance(results). To advance our under- standing of how the construct of job performance(behaviors) changes with time, dynamic performance research must place a greater emphasis on this criterion and forgo the conveniences associated with ‘‘objective’’ measures. Researchers will either need to deal with the difﬁculties associated with gathering subjective ratings of performance or accept and acknowledge the imprecision and unreliability of objective ratings of performance results.

Missing Data In addition to measurement error, missing data is also a ubiquitous problem for research studying employee performance over time. While missing data issues are common for longitudinal research in general because of attrition in multiwave studies (Goodman & Blum, 1996; Newman, 2003), it is a particular problem in longitudinal studies of job performance because there are systematic relationships between job performance and attrition. First, extensive evidence reveals a relationship between job performance and voluntary turnover (e.g., Harrison et al., 1996; Sturman & Trevor, 2001; Trevor et al., 1997; Salamin & Hom, 2005; Williams & Livingstone, 1994). Second, companies use such mechanisms as probationary periods to ﬁre low performers, creating a relationship between job performance and involun- tary turnover (e.g., De Corte, 1994). Third, companies may promote high performers to other jobs, thereby creating another mechanism that can create a relationship between performance and the likelihood of missing data. The consequence of the systematic relationships between performance and attrition not only will cause data to be missing in longitudinal studies of job performance, but it will restrict the range in observed performance scores (Sturman & Trevor, 2001).

Research on missing data (e.g., Little & Rubin, 2002) has identiﬁed three types of missing data: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and not missing at random (NMAR). For data to be MCAR, it must both be ‘‘observed at random’’ (OAR) and ‘‘missing at random’’ (MAR). That is, (1) the pattern of missing data must not depend on the values of data that are observed (i.e., it is OAR), and (2) the likelihood that data is missing must not depend on the values of the data that are missing (i.e., it is MAR). If these conditions are met, then missing data will not likely bias population mean estimates (Little & Rubin, 2002). For predicting job performance (Pt), data is classiﬁed as MAR if the probability
