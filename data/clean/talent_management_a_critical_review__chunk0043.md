# 6.1. TM decision architecture

The typical research study in the large body of strategic HRM literature begins with an examination of the HR practices and/or talent investment decisions of an organization and determines the strength of the relationship with strategically relevant (profitability, share price) or tactically relevant (turnover) outcomes. The decisions that led to that initial state – why the organization chose (or chose not) to invest in strong selection systems or leader development systems in the first place – are left unexamined. Yet, understanding these initial conditions is crucial for interpreting the HR practice-outcome linkage. At least one frequently cited study found a negative relationship between a common HR practice (the use of multi-rater feedback tools) and organizational performance (Watson Wyatt Worlwide, 2001).
