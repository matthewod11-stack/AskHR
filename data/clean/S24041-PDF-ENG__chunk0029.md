## who practice it demonstrate humility and a belief in the power of

collaboration. Using active listening skills, they draw out the ideas of

followers and meld them with their own, perhaps by saying, “I’m going

to tell you everything I can about what I think we need to do and why

it’s important. Then I need your help. I can’t do this by myself. Each of

you has diﬀerent abilities, ones I don’t have. Together we can solve this

problem and achieve something really special.”
