# Types of Harassment

Legally, sexual harassment can take one of two forms: quid pro quo or hostile environment.

Quid Pro Quo With quid pro quo, the granting of sexual favors is tied to such employment deci- sions as promotions and salary increases. An example of a quid pro quo case of harassment is a supervisor who tells his secretary that she must sleep with him to keep her job. In quid pro quo cases, a single incident is enough to constitute sexual harassment and result in the organization being liable for legal damages (Gutman, ).

Hostile Environment In a hostile environment case, sexual harassment occurs when an unwanted pattern of conduct related to gender unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance. Though men and women differ in their perceptions of what constitutes harassment (Rotundo, Nguyen, & Sackett, ), the courts have ruled that such conduct can include comments, unwanted sexual or romantic advances, or the display of demeaning posters, signs, or cartoons (Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co., ).

Pattern of Behavior. For conduct to be considered sexual harassment based on a hos- tile environment, the U. S. Supreme Court has ruled that the conduct must be a pattern of behavior rather than an isolated incident (Clark County School District v. Breeden, ). It would not be harassment to ask a coworker for a date, even if the coworker does not agree to the date. It becomes harassment if the coworker continually makes unwanted romantic or sexual overtures or repeatedly makes inappropriate remarks.

Based on Gender. To be considered sexual harassment, conduct must be due to the sex of the employee. That is, but for the sex of the employee, would the conduct have occurred? For example, in Christopher Lack v. Wal-Mart (), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a supervisor’s lewd and vulgar language and

jokes were not sexual harassment because they were made both to males and to females. The Courts of Appeal for the Seventh (Holman v. Indiana Department of Transportation, ) and Eighth (Jenkins v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty, ) Circuits have made similar rulings. Members of a police department con- sistently referring to female officers as “babes” or “honey” would be an example of sexual harassment because the comments are based on gender and are demean- ing to the female officers. A male officer calling a female officer “stupid” would be an example of rude behavior, but not sexual harassment because the nature of the comment was not based on gender.

In , the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether an employee can sexu- ally harass a member of the same gender. That is, if a male makes sexual com- ments or improperly touches another male, is this a case of sexual harassment? In the case of Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (), the Supreme Court said yes. As a roustabout on an oil platform, Mr. Oncale was subjected to sexual threats and battery by other male roustabouts. After getting no help from his supervisor, Oncale quit his job and filed suit, eventually reaching the Supreme Court. The key to the Oncale ruling was that the harassment was due to Oncale’s sex (he was harassed because he was a male), not his sexual orientation. It should be noted that in states that have not added sexual orientation as a protected class, harassment on the basis of sexual orientation is probably not illegal because sex- ual orientation is not a federally protected class (Bibby v. Coca Cola, ; Rene v. MGM Grand Hotel, ; Spearman v. Ford, ).

It should be pointed out that employers should not tolerate harassment of any type. Protected classes are a legal concept rather than a moral one, and few HR professionals would argue against the idea that employers have a moral obli- gation to provide a workplace free of harassment.

Negative to the Reasonable Person. Any pattern of behavior based on gender that causes an employee discomfort might constitute sexual harassment (Egler, ). In Har- ris v. Forklift Systems (), the court found that a male supervisor’s comments such as, “Let’s go to the Holiday Inn and negotiate your raise” and “You’re just a dumb-ass woman” constituted harassment, even though the female employee did not suffer any great psychological damage or “have a nervous breakdown.”
