# Academy of Management Review

nism as a principle driving force in behavior. Individuals were seen as focusing their efforts on seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. This principle was later refined and further devel- oped in the works of philosophers like Locke, Bentham, Mill, and Helvetius, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

nism of the past. Past actions that led to positive outcomes would tend to be repeated, whereas past actions that led to negative outcomes would tend to diminish. Thorndike (1911) re- ferred to this as the law of effect, while Hull (1943) suggested that effort or motivation was largely determined by drive (cid:1) habit.

Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the issue of motivation began to migrate from the realm of philosophy to the newly emerging sci- ence of psychology. Challenges immediately arose over the use of hedonism as the basis for the study of motivation. As Vroom explains, he- donism had

no clear-cut specification of the type of events that were pleasurable or painful, or even how these events could be determined for a particular individual; nor did it make clear how persons acquired their conceptions of ways of attaining pleasure or pain, or how the source of pleasure or pain might be modified by experience. In short, the hedonistic assumption has no empirical con- tent and was untestable (1964: 10).

As a result, behavioral scientists began search- ing for more empirically based models to ex- plain motivation.

Among these early models were instinct the- ories, such as those proposed by James, Freud, and McDougall. Instead of viewing behavior as highly rational, these theorists argued that much behavior resulted from instinct, defined by McDougall as

â€œan inherited or innate psychological predisposi- tion which determined its possessor to perceive, or pay attention to, objects of a certain class, to experience an emotional excitement of a partic- ular quality upon perceiving such an object, and to act in regard to it in a particular manner (1908: 4).

James identified a list of such instincts that in- cluded locomotion, curiosity, sociability, fear, jealousy, and sympathy.

Beginning around the 1920s, however, as in- creased limitations of the theory began to emerge, instinct theories began to be replaced by models based on drive or reinforcement. Led by such psychologists as Thorndike, Wood- worth, and Hull, drive theorists introduced the concept of learning in motivated behavior and posited that decisions concerning present or fu- ture behaviors are largely influenced by the consequences of rewards associated with past behavior. Allport (1954) referred to this as hedo-

Skinner (1953) and others later built on these principles with the introduction of operant con- ditioning (referred to by some as reinforcement theories), arguing that, over time, individuals learn contingent relationships between actions and their consequences and that these contin- gencies guide future behavior. Reinforcement models continue to thrive today as explanatory vehicles for understanding work motivation and job performance, as well as in the workplace in various performance management programs (e.g., Komaki, 2003).

While psychologists were focusing on in- stincts and drives, managers were focusing on more pragmatic issues. A key development here was the work of Frederick Taylor and his col- leagues in the scientific management move- ment. Coming from an industrial engineering background, Taylor (1911), along with many of his associates, focused his attention on the in- efficiencies of factory production in an increas- ingly industrialized age. These colleagues pro- posed a new and paternalistic approach to managing workers that relied on a combination of job training, pay-for-performance incentive systems, improved employee selection tech- niques, and job redesign, including the intro- duction of ergonomics. Far from being exploit- ative in intent, Taylor and his associates saw scientific management as an economic boon to both workers and management through the use of improved manufacturing techniques, in- creased operating efficiency, and shared re- wards. However, the subsequent rise of an in- creasingly sophisticated workforce, coupled with company efforts to maximize productivity without simultaneously increasing employee re- wards, eventually served to discredit this sys- tem, leading to the widespread rise of unioniza- tion efforts in the 1930s.

Meanwhile, social scientists and managers began to consider the role of social influences on behavior in the 1930s. The role of group dy- namics and the need to view employees as com- plex beings with multiple motivational influ- ences were recognized as powerful influences
