article was written in the WashingtonPost about potential decoy effects in the 2008 presidential election (Vedantum, 2007).

I am not sure IOOB has taken note of these ﬁndings as much as would be suggested by the number of publications on these topics. Nor am I sure why this is the case; perhaps it is because of the fact that many of the studies are based in the laboratory or because they involve experimenter-constructed scenarios or vignettes so they may be dismissed as contrived situations. On many submissions in which the decision was a rejection (and some in which the submission was eventually accepted), reviewers on these papers have wondered aloud whether the situations presented in these scenarios are realistic or whether they could actually happen in a ‘‘real organization.’’ This is always interesting to me because that from opinion seems to be very different the opinions I have heard expressed by practitioners at SIOP poster sessions and by working managers in courses I have taught. Susan Mohammed: There are some JDM ﬁndings that do get cited in IOOB venues. The work on team cognition and team mental models, in particular, had its origins in decision making (e.g., Klimoski & Mohammed, 1994) and has preserved some of this focus over time (e.g., Kellermanns, Floyd, Pearson, & Spencer, 2008). Similarly, that sense-making and framing effects have traditionally been investigated at the individual level have also been examined at (e.g., Mohammed & Ringseis, 2001). In addition, the program of research by Hollenbeck and colleagues on hierarchical decision-making teams with distributed expertise (e.g., Hollenbeck et al., 1995) was featured in IOOB journals. Although more the exception than the rule, the multidisciplinary work by Cannon- Bowers and Salas (1998) on improving team training in tactical decision-making teams under stress is an example of the merging of JDM and IOOB research.

However,
