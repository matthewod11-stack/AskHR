# Conversational Media Search Agent

The Conversational Media Search Agent is specialized in helping users find and play music,

audiobooks, and podcasts. This agent retrieves media from local databases or streaming

services, uses web search for additional content when necessary, suggests media based on

contextual factors like mood, weather, and time of day, and handles voice commands such

as "Play a relaxing playlist for my drive." It also identifies similar artists or content when users

ask questions like "Who sounds like John Coltrane?"
