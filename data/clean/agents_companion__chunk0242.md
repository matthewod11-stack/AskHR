# it from the motorway?"

Navigation Agent: "Gasthaus Alte MÃ¼hle has a dedicated parking area with about 40

spaces. It's only 1.2 kilometers from the A9 exit at Ingolstadt-Nord - about a 2-minute drive.

They're known for their Schweinebraten and homemade dumplings. It gets busy around

noon, but it's currently showing moderate occupancy. Would you like me to set this as your

destination and guide you there? You'll arrive around 12:15 if we head there now."
