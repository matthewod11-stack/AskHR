# On the question of whether or not

performance improvements were related to frequency of feedback, the study findings reveal that the incremental R2 resulting from entering the number of times the manager had received upward feedback was not significant, thereby indicating that improvement from time 1 to time 4 was not related to the number of times managers had received feedback. The findings for the third question showed a trend toward a smaller discrepancy between self and subordinate ratings with successive administrations of feedback.

Therefore, the Hegarty (1974), Atwater et al. (1995) and Reilly et al. (1996) findings support the view that providing individuals with upward feedback can lead to a perceived positive change in performance from the subordinates' perspective. However, Smither et al.'s (1995b) and Atwater et al.'s (2000) findings contradict those reported in these earlier studies.

Smither et al. (1995b) conducted a

longitudinal study to explore the effect of upward appraisal on performance. They report that there was an increase in the ratings in time 2 compared with time 1 overall but this improvement was small (d = 0.16). This improvement was found regardless of whether the manager received an individual report or not. Therefore, Smither et al.'s finding that managers improved irrespective of whether the individual received a feedback report or not suggests that providing individuals with written individual upward feedback does not predict that subsequent performance levels will improve.

Walker and Smither's (1999) study is

significant for two reasons. First, the study was longitudinal (five years), which is twice as long as that examined in previous studies. Second, theirs is the first study to examine whether managers' responses to upward feedback are related to subsequent performance improvements. Their findings indicate that managers did improve their performance over the five-year period. Managers who responded more positively to the feedback by conducting feedback sessions with their raters improved their performance more than managers who did not engage in this activity. This is a very important finding since it highlights that what managers do with their upward feedback significantly influences the nature of the outcomes.

Atwater et al. (2000) set out to examine the

outcomes associated with an upward feedback programme in a policing agency in the USA. Like Smither et al. (1995b), they too used a longitudinal study in their research design. They found that leadership scores at time 2 for participants in the feedback group (subjects who received written feedback at time 1 and time 2) were not significantly higher than the scores for participants in either the control group (subjects who were surveyed at time 2 and received feedback at time 2) or the survey only group (subjects who were surveyed at time 1 and time 2 but only received written feedback at time 2).

These findings highlight that

individualised feedback reports may not be the significant factor leading to enhanced performance following the implementation of an upward feedback system. Rather, as Atwater et al. (2000) suggest, it may be the ``hype'' that goes on in the organisation about the introduction of an upward feedback programme that results in a ``Hawthorne effect''. This ``Hawthorne effect'' results in everyone in the organisation paying more attention to their leadership because of the emphasis that is being placed on such skills by top management. Therefore, the issue of better communication between management and employees of the skills and competencies that are rewarded by the organisation might be as effective as introducing an upward appraisal system.

Supervisor attitudes towards upward appraisal ``Research on performance appraisal has found that attitudes toward the appraisal system and its characteristics can have a substantial effect on the ultimate effectiveness of that system'' (Bernardin et al., 1993, p. 316). Considering that
