## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 175

the issue of Conscientiousness as a moderator of the relationship between stress, dissatisfaction, and justice and CWBs. However, the stress-response literature once again suggests a reasonable hy- pothesis. In general, this literature suggests that in response to stressful life events, conscientious individuals engage in more ac- tive planning, less maladaptive coping, and more support-seeking behavior than do nonconscientious individuals (Jelinek & Morf, 1995; Vollrath et al., 1994; Vollrath, Torgersen, & Alnaes, 1995; Watson & Hubbard, 1996). These Ô¨Åndings suggest that conscien- tious individuals will seek out more constructive ways to deal with stress, dissatisfaction, and injustice than will nonconscientious in- dividuals, resulting in fewer counterproductive behaviors.
