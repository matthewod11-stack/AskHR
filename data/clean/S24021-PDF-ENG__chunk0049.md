## semiconductor industry. From 2015 to 2020, the top 10 semiconductor

companies grew at an average annual compound rate of 9.2%. However,

excluding the two fastest growers during this time (Nvidia, with a

CAGR of 27%, and Taiwan Semiconductor, with a CAGR of 12.3%),

the average dropped to 6.5%. Nvidia’s rapid growth stems from its

capabilities in the design of powerful graphics processing units, or

GPUs. Those capabilities helped Nvidia capture a 61% market share in

the fast-growing market for chips used to power machine-learning and

other artiﬁcial intelligence applications; the next closest rival is Intel,

with a 16% share. The AI chip market oﬀers high growth potential only

to companies with the R&D capabilities to compete there—for others, it

is not a particularly attractive opportunity.

The basic question that companies must address is: In which markets

do our capabilities and other unique resources (such as brand, customer

relationships, reputation, and so on) provide us with a competitive

advantage? A scale-focused strategy will tend to revolve around deep,
