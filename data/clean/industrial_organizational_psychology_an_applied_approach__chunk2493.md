being treated unfairly, provide examples, and discuss what you need. A fact of life at work is that supervisors are rarely in touch with their employ- ees’ feelings, and if you don’t speak up, they will never know. If the behavior continues after your discussion, you may need to think about options such as talking to a higher-level manager, ignoring your feelings (easier said than done), or changing jobs. However, remember that there is some truth to clichés such as “Life is rough” and the “Grass is always greener on the other side of the hill.” If you leave an organization to find one where “nobody plays politics,” you will probably be disappointed.

During your annual performance appraisal, discuss your needs for challenge and growth. If you want to advance in the organization, find out what you need to do and work with your supervisor to develop a plan for you to get the necessary training or experi- ence. Again, don’t wait for someone to come to you. You need to take charge of your own career.

If you are unhappy, keep it to yourself. This advice may seem a bit harsh but the reality is that other employees don’t want to hear your complaints, and if they do, they will probably use your words against you at some point. Identify the reasons you are unhappy at work and create a plan for change. Whining without rational action will not help your career or make you any happier.

According to the intrinsic satisfaction theory and job characteristics theory, we will be more satisfied with our jobs if the tasks themselves are enjoyable to perform. What makes a task enjoyable varies across individuals. For some, work- ing on a computer is fun, whereas for others, nothing could be more boring. Many people enjoy making decisions, solving conflicts, and seeing a project through from start to finish, whereas others don’t.

Overall satisfaction can be affected by our satisfaction with individual fac- ets of the job. For example, an incompetent boss, terrible coworkers, low pay, or limited opportunities for advancement can lessen overall job satisfaction. Even trivial things can lessen job satisfaction. I once worked at a job where the vend- ing machines never worked and supplies such as paper and pens were often not available. These factors were irritants for most employees—enough to lessen job satisfaction but certainly not enough to make any of us dissatisfied with the job. According to social learning theory, we will be more satisfied if our coworkers are satisfied. If everyone else is whining and complaining, it is difficult to be the only person at work who loves his job.

No matter how much we intrinsically like our work, equity and justice theories predict that we will become dissatisfied if rewards, punishments, and social interactions are not given equitably. If you work harder than a coworker, yet she receives a bigger raise, you are less likely to be satisfied even though money may not be the reason you are working.

On the basis of job characteristics theory and Maslow’s level of self- actualization, lack of opportunity for growth, challenge, variety, autonomy, and advancement will decrease satisfaction for many people.

The results of these factors are summed to indicate an employee’s current level of satisfaction. As conditions change, so will the level of satisfaction. To apply what you have learned about job satisfaction, complete Exercise . in your workbook.
