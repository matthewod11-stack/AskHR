are socialized to perceive behaviours differently. Thus, it is suggested that those employees who are disadvantaged by the distribution of opportunities, treatment, and conditions are likely to perceive both societal and workplace gender inequality to a greater extent than those employees who are not disadvantaged. Since in most cases the disadvantaged employees are women, gender is expected to have an impact on employees’ perceptions of both societal and workplace gender inequality in a way that female employees are likely to perceive both types of inequality to a greater extent than male employees.

Hypothesis 1: female employees are more likely to perceive higher levels of (a) societal and (b) workplace gender inequality.

According to Shapiro’s and Kirkman’s (2001) anticipatory injustice model, people’s perceptions match their schemata, which are based on their prior experience. The older an individual is, the more experience he/she obtains, the more is the likelihood that he/she has experienced injustice and, thus, continually sees it. In contrast, the younger an individual is, the less experience he/she has, the less formed opinions he/she possesses, and the less is the likelihood that he/she will perceive societal and workplace gender inequality. Consequently, based on anticipatory injustice model, age is hypothesized to have an impact on employees’ perceptions of both types of gender inequality. Older employees are suggested to perceive gender inequality to a greater extent than younger ones.

Hypothesis 2: there is a positive relationship between age and employees’ perceptions of (a) societal and (b) workplace gender inequality.

Relative deprivation theory (Crosby, 1982) claims that a married individual may differ from an unmarried one in the relative value he/she places on various outcomes and characteristics of his/her marriage. According to the theory, while married individuals tend to value stability and harmony in their relationships, unmarried individuals are likely to appreciate independence and autonomy. In addition, empirical evidence has shown that married and cohabiting individuals may be less critical towards gender inequality than those who are not (Cohen and Korchmeyer, 1995; Davis and Robinson, 1991). Thus, based on relative deprivation theory, married employees are expected to perceive both societal and workplace gender inequality to a lesser extent than unmarried ones.

Hypothesis 3: there is a negative relationship between marriage and employees’ perceptions of (a) societal and (b) workplace gender inequality.

Education may also have an impact on whether and to what extent employees perceive societal and workplace gender inequality. Employees who are more highly educated are likely to be more critical of the traditional labour distribution where women’s work is considered to be less valuable than men’s because these employees have a tendency to adjust their attitudes on the basis of evidence they come across rather than on historical and traditional norms (Judge and Livingston, 2008). Accordingly, employees who have high education are more likely to have knowledge about cases involving gender inequality. They are, thus, expected to be more aware of gender inequality than individuals with lower education (Davis and Robinson, 1991). Consequently, education is hypothesized to influence employees’ perceptions of both societal and workplace gender inequality in a way that
