## HBR / Magazine Article / Life’s Work: An Interview with Ketanji Brown Jackson

You clerked for judges with different management styles. You described one as a master nurturer, another as meticulous and scholarly. What kind of leader are you?

I try to draw from both sets of qualities. I am very warm and open

with my staﬀ. I have a small group that works directly for me, my law

clerks and my assistants, and we do fun things together. I try to be a

nurturer in that sense. But I also ensure that we are doing the work

necessary to lay out my opinions in a clear and thorough fashion. I

have pretty high expectations for the drafts that we generate, and I’m

a very substantial editor of the opinions coming out of my chambers. I

work very, very hard to prepare for arguments, to ask questions that I

think will be meaningful in helping understand the issues and shape the

debate. So I do think that I exhibit a number of qualities of my former

bosses—hopefully the best qualities. But you’d have to ask my staﬀ what

they think!
