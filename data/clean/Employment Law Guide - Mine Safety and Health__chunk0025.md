# appeal to a U.S. Court of Appeals.

The Mine Act requires MSHA to promulgate new or improved mandatory safety or health standards to protect life and prevent injuries. Under the Mine Act, mine operators must notify MSHA when they open or close a

mine. In addition, operators may request the modiﬁcation of the application of a safety standard at a mine.

MSHA may grant a modiﬁcation if it determines that the operator's proposed alternate method of compliance

with the standard guarantees no less than the same measure of protection aﬀorded the miners by the standard, or application of the standard at the mine will result in a diminution of safety to the miners.
