What happens when organizations don’t take kindness seriously?

People leave or are absent, trust erodes, teams stop communicating

well, time is lost to tension and conﬂict, and customers feel the impact.

One study of more than 500 of the world’s leading companies during the

Great Resignation found that an unkind workplace culture was over 10

times more likely than compensation to be the reason why people left

a job. Another study found that Fortune 1000 managers spend nearly

In contrast, workplaces with cultures and systems that support kindness

have been shown to have stronger relationships, greater collaboration,

and higher engagement and retention. Staﬀ are more likely to help each

other, speak up, share ideas, and stay. Customers are more likely to trust

the service and recommend it to others.

Kindness isn’t soft. It’s not optional and it can’t be left to chance.

Like safety protocols and performance reviews, kindness must be

built into how people work. That means expectations, systems, and

accountability. It’s part of the social infrastructure that builds trust,

## collaboration, and connection within and across an organization.

To make this real, organizations need a shared, clear understanding

of what kindness looks like so that employees know when they are

doing it well and consistently between colleagues, across teams and

# organizations, and with customers.

Let’s start with what kindness is and isn’t. Kindness is something we

do, not just something we feel. It shows up in the choices we make and

the ways we behave. The research of one of us (Nicki Macklin), whose

aim was to distinguish between kindness, compassion and empathy in

healthcare services, came up with this deﬁnition of kindness: The

proactive effort to support someone else’s growth, well-being, or success;

it is a set of observable, intentional actions.

Kindness often means doing hard things like giving tough feedback.

Imagine someone on a team you’re managing keeps missing deadlines.

When things are busy, it’s tempting to swoop in and ﬁx it yourself, let

it slide, or get angry or frustrated and snap at the person. Kindness

means taking a diﬀerent approach. It means creating space and time

to ask that person: “What’s going on?” Maybe he is unclear about the

task priorities. Maybe he is overwhelmed at work or at home. Whatever

the reason, your best response may be to work with him to reset

expectations, improve communication, or change his workload. This

isn’t about making excuses or lowering standards. It’s about helping

people to meet them and doing so in a way that builds trust and respect.

Niceness is about avoiding discomfort, staying agreeable, sidestepping

hard conversations, and letting things slide. Kindness means the

opposite. It doesn’t require agreement or even liking each other.
