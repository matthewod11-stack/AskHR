a signiﬁcant number of new skills. To determine whether a move is

bold, we use a measure we call “skill distance”—the percentage of new

skills needed in the new job. The median skill distance for all job moves

is roughly 25%, meaning that a quarter of the required skills were not

used in the person’s previous role. When a job move has a skill distance

higher than 25%, we consider it to be bold.

One way to increase your experience capital is to make bold moves

throughout your career. Your pay tends to go up the most when you take

a new job that requires novel skills, which is when your learning curve

is the steepest. When you make multiple bold moves during your career,

move later on, it can take some work to ﬁnd the right opportunity. Here

are a few steps you can follow:
