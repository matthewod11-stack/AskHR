In the fall of 1967, I began my pursuit of a masterâ€™s degree in I-O psychology at the Geor- gia Institute of Technology. The I-O faculty, most of whom had served in the military as

psychologists during World War II, instilled in students the desire to make a difference as sci- entist-practitioners. I was assigned to work with William Ronan as his research assistant. Ronan was a former student of Flanagan (1954), the developer of the critical technique noted above.
