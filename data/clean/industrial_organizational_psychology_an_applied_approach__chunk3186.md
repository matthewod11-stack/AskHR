# Managing Change

514

chapter 

You learned about increasing an individual employee’s skills through

training in Chapter . In this chapter, you will learn about organization development—the process of improving organizational performance by mak- ing organization-wide, rather than individual, changes (Burke, ). Though there are many aspects to organization development, this chapter will focus on four major issues: managing change, empowering employees, downsizing, and implementing innovative work schedules.

In organizations, change occurs for many reasons and takes on many forms. Some changes are due to such organization development efforts as downsizing, reorga- nization, or the introduction of teams. Some changes are the result of external mandates like managed care or new government regulations. Still other changes occur due to new leadership or new personnel.
