## a persistent underinvestment in our own development.

We sometimes think that engaging in learning will detract from

performance, but that is shortsighted. Research in many domains shows

the opposite: The highest performers are those who regularly engage in

the learning zone. It doesn’t need to take more time. It’s about how we

go about our daily work and life while getting things done.

When we explore others’ ideas, leap beyond the known, try new ways

of working, ask questions, experiment, examine mistakes, and solicit

feedback, we discover ways to work smarter and achieve greater impact.
