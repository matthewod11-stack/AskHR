knowledge, skills and ability required for a particular job are determined by interviewing the incumbents, focus groups and collecting data from ``job-task information questionnaires''. The rating instrument is then designed based on the skills and knowledge that an employee needs to possess to be effective in that role.

2 This model is competency based. Rather

than simply measuring KSAs, this approach is more concerned with measuring the competencies associated with a particular job. Wexley and Klimoski (1984, p. 79) define managerial competence as ``characteristics of an individual that lead to behaviours that meet the job demands within the parameters of the organisational environment and that, in turn, brings about desired results''. For this purpose, competencies are identified by comparing behaviours of high performing individuals with those of the low performers. Thus, the differences form a set of ``best'' competencies and these competencies form the basis for developing the rating items in the questionnaire.

3 This model focuses on strategic planning. This type of 3608 assessment measures KSAs based on an organisation's strategic plans. It is espoused that these behaviours will facilitate the organisation in the achievement of its strategic goals and plans. Nowack (1993) terms these KSAs as ``strategic'' and they are identified through interviews and focus groups with key senior executives.

4 This model is derived from

developmental theory. This is based on theoretical and conceptual models of employee growth and development. It is closely correlated with career development and management development. The basic is that 3608 feedback leads to enhanced self- awareness, which in turn leads to more effective career development processes (McCarthy and Garavan, 1999).

5 A fifth model is based on personality theory (Nowack, 1993). This model measures KSAs that are associated with personality such as qualities, traits, temperaments, communication styles, interpersonal relations and cognition. The emphasis of the rating instrument is on personality traits and the recipient receives feedback on his/her personality. This is one of the least common models used for designing and developing 3608 assessments.

The particular model utilised is determined to a large extent by the purpose that the feedback system serves. For example, if the multi-source feedback is used solely for training and development, then it follows that the system will be developed with greater awareness of developmental theory. Currently, it is the tenets of developmental theory that form the foundation on which the majority of 3608 feedback processes are based.

Potential benefits of 36088 feedback Commentators propose that the use of 3608 feedback brings many advantages to the adopting organisation. Some commentators merely propose advantages but others have conducted empirical studies to support their propositions and hypotheses.

It is widely accepted that multi-source appraisal enhances two-way communication in the host organisation (London and Beatty, 1993; Garavan et al., 1997; Bernardin and Beatty, 1987). London and Beatty (1993) argue that 3608 feedback can call attention to important performance dimensions heretofore neglected by the organisation and at the same time convey organisational values to employees. They argue that 3608 feedback can build more effective work relationships; increase opportunities for employee involvement; uncover and resolve conflict and demonstrate respect for employee opinions on the part of top management.

Garavan et al. (1997) highlight some other organisational and individual benefits of the 3608 feedback process. Organisational benefits include employee involvement and better working relationships within the organisation. Essentially, the organisational benefits revolve around an improvement in employee relations. Where the individual recipient of the feedback is concerned, it is espoused that the feedback data will be more valid, fair and reliable because they come from a number of sources. As a result of the 3608 feedback, the individual may have a better guide for his/her career development because the feedback that the recipient receives increases his/her self-awareness and this enhanced self-awareness is an initial step in the career development process (McCarthy and Garavan, 1999).

Hazucha et al. (1993) highlight some of the

advantages of feedback from an individual perspective. They suggest that recipients receive valuable information which they may use to identify and address their
