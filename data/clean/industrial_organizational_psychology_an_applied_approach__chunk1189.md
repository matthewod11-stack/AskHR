# Drug Testing

Drug testing certainly is one of the most controversial testing methods used by HR professionals. The reason for its high usage is that .% of employees admit to using drugs in the past month (Larson, Eyerman, Foster, & Gfroerer, ) and HR professionals believe not only that illegal drug use is dangerous but also that many employees are under the influence of drugs at work. Their beliefs are supported by research indicating that compared with non–drug-users, illegal drug users are more likely to miss work (Bahls, ; Larson et al., ; Normand, Salyards, & Mahoney, ), are  times as likely to use health care benefits (Bahls, ), are more likely to be fired and quit their jobs (Larson et al., ; Normand et al., ), and have . times as many accidents on the job (Cadrain, a). One consulting firm estimates that a substance-abusing employee costs the employer $, per year in lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical costs (Payne, ). Though the few available studies conclude that applicants testing positive for drugs will engage in some counterproductive behaviors, some authors (e.g., Morgan, ) believe that these studies are terribly flawed.

Because of such statistics, organizations are increasing their drug testing before applicants are hired. The increase in drug testing has resulted in fewer applicants testing positive for drugs; .% in  compared to % in  (OHS, Inc., n.d.).

.% of employers test applicants for drug use .% of adults admitted to using drugs in the previous month and .% reported to recent alcohol abuse men, people without college degrees, the unemployed, and employees with low-paying jobs were the most likely to have recently used drugs food preparation workers (.%), restaurant servers (.%), construction workers (.%), and writers, athletes, and designers (.%) are the most common drug users, whereas protective services (.%), social services (.%), and people working in education (.%) were the least common users of drugs.

Ninety-eight percent of the time, when applicants test positive for drugs, their job offers are withdrawn. When current employees test positive, % of organizations fire them and % refer them for counseling and treatment (Greenberg, ).

In general, applicants seem to accept drug testing as being reasonably fair (Mastrangelo, ; Truxillo, Normandy, & Bauer, ). Not surprisingly, com- pared with people who have never tried drugs, current drug users think drug testing is less fair, and previous drug users think drug testing is less fair if it results in termination but not when the consequence for being caught is rehabili- tation (Truxillo et al., ). Regardless of their popularity, drug testing programs appear to reduce employee drug use (French, Roebuck, & Alexandre, ).

Drug testing usually is done in two stages. In the first, an employee or applicant provides a urine or hair sample that is subjected to an initial screening test. The most common initial drug screens for urine are the enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). EMIT uses enzymes as reagents, while RIA uses radioactive tagging. Both cost approximately $ per sample. Hair-follicle testing costs two to three times as much per sample.

If the initial test for drugs is positive, then second-stage testing is done. The urine sample undergoes a more expensive confirmation test, such as thin-layer chromatography or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis.

When both stages are used, testing is very accurate in detecting the presence of drugs. But drug tests are not able to determine whether an individual is impaired by drug use. An employee smoking marijuana on Saturday night will test positive for the drug on Monday, even though the effects of the drug have long since gone away. Most drugs can be detected  to  days after they have been used. The excep- tions are the benzodiazepines, which can be detected for  to  weeks after use; PCP, which can be detected for  to  weeks; and marijuana, which can be detected up to  days for the casual user and up to  days for the frequent user. Testing conducted on hair follicles rather than urine samples can detect drug usage over longer periods, whereas testing using blood, saliva, or perspiration samples detect drug usage over shorter periods of time. A disadvantage to testing hair follicles is that it takes a few days before drugs will be detected in the hair; thus it is not a good method to determine whether an employee is currently under the influence. Because positive drug tests have a certain degree of uncertainty, if an appli- cant fails a pre-employment drug test, he can usually reapply  months later. With such a policy, there are few legal pitfalls.

In the public sector or in the union environment, however, drug test- ing becomes complicated when it occurs after applicants are hired. Testing of employees usually takes one of three forms:

. All employees or randomly selected employees are tested at

predetermined times.
