4 We did not report the individual components in our primary analysis, because many of the primary studies reported the data for composites only. We analyzed the existing data on components that did exist. The correla- tions of the components from the scale of Podsakoff et al. (1990) and colleagues are as follows: individual consideration, r (cid:1) .70 (k (cid:1) 7; N (cid:1) 4,035); role modeling, r (cid:1) .67 (k (cid:1) 3; N (cid:1) 2,304); goals, r (cid:1) .57 (k (cid:1) 3; N (cid:1) 2,304); intellectual stimulation, r (cid:1) .55 (k (cid:1) 6; N (cid:1) 3,852); vision, r (cid:1) .54 (k (cid:1) 4; N (cid:1) 2,387). These results should be considered as exploratory given that data on components were not reported in all studies.
