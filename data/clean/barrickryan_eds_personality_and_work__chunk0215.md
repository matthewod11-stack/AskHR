# 62 PERSONALITY AND WORK

theoretical and empirical work linking individual differences (cog- nitive abilities, personality traits, and interests) with job behavior con- structs (delegating and coordinating, exchanging information, operating machines), particularly through well-grounded theories of motivation. According to social cognitive theory, an understanding of relationships between individual differences and job behavior re- quires an understanding of the cognitive processes that link them.

As Davis and Luthans (1980, p. 285) have pointed out, a main focus of social cognitive theory is “to investigate the mediating ef- fects that covert cognitive processes have on an otherwise observ- able sequence of events.” Cognition thus becomes the mediator that explains how situational factors and individual differences get translated into behavioral responses (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Manz & Stewart, 1997). A major purpose of this chapter is to advance re- search focusing on work behavior by explicitly describing the cog- nitive processes that link personality traits to that behavior. These cognitive processes reﬂect cognitive-motivational work intentions, which reﬂect basic goals that people pursue at work. These inten- tions provide a goal-focused explanation of why certain personal- ity traits are associated with high levels of work performance.

Figure 3.1 presents a social cognitive model that we will de- velop to describe how traits, situations, and cognitive-motivational work intentions relate to each other and thereby inﬂuence behav- ior. As shown, personality traits link to work intentions, which in turn inﬂuence performance. These relationships are moderated by situational demands associated with competitive and coopera- tive settings. To develop the model, we discuss the cognitive moti- vational work intentions through which personality affects behavior, speciﬁcally deﬁne and explore the mediating mechanisms of mo- tivation on the personality-performance relationship, and then dis- cuss the inﬂuence of situational demands and opportunities on these relationships.
