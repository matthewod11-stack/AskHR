## Impact of inclusiveleadershipon employeeinnovativebehavior

recognized and trained employees by respecting and focusing on employee training and prais- ing achievements rather than displaying jealousy [30]. (3) Leaders treated employees fairly, considered their needs and interests, showed a fair attitude towards employees, and ensured that they share earnings.

Compared with the other forms of leadership that may be conceptually related, inclusive leadership held unique nature of acceptance, belongingness, uniqueness, and inclusiveness [18]. Specifically, transformational leadership focused on motivating and developing employ- ees based on the organization’s needs [31], and transformational leadership centered in the leader, without active employee involvement, reciprocal influence, and rewards [28]. In con- trast, inclusive leadership emphasized on accepting employees for who they were, allowing them to contribute their unique abilities and views, and encouraging them to involve in orga- nizational activities. Although, servant leadership focused on helping employee grow and succeed [32], inclusive leadership focused on tending to member’s needs for work group open- ness and availability. While empowering leadership focused on leading by example, sharing power, teaching and coaching [33] inclusive leadership facilitated the perception of inclusive- ness and accessibility. Based on above differences, the overlap between inclusive leadership and existing conceptualizations of leadership was minimal, and other types of leadership could not fully capture key tenets of inclusive leadership [18]. Despite the unique and critical role of inclusive leadership in the leadership research, to date, few studies have investigated the link between inclusive leadership and employee innovative behavior. The aim of this paper was to investigate how supportive conditions in an organization affected employee innovative behav- ior through POS. Fig 1 showed the research model developed for this purpose.
