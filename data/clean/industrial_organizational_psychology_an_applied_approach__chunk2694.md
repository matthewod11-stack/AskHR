Show the speaker you want to listen by using nonverbal cues such as making eye contact and nodding your head. Remove or resist distractions that will keep you from listening. Be silent for a few seconds after the person has finished speaking. This will encourage the person to continue to talk, you will be sure when they have finished talking, and it will give you time to respond calmly.

Emotional State The interpretation of a message can certainly be affected by the receiver’s emo- tional state. When we are mad, anxious, depressed, elated, or upset, we do not think as clearly as when our moods are more moderate. Think of the last time you had an argument with someone. How rational and intelligent was your con- versation? After the argument was over, did both of you remember what was said in the same way?

Likewise, have you ever attended a class when your mind was somewhere else? My guess is that neither your attention span nor your comprehension of the material was as high as normal.

Cognitive Ability Cognitive ability is another factor than can affect the way in which a received mes- sage is interpreted. That is, a person can receive a message exactly as it was sent, yet not be bright enough to understand it. For example, have you ever attended a class where you had no idea what the professor was talking about? You heard her words and saw her diagrams, but the message still made no sense. Likewise, have you ever told a great pun, only to be disappointed that the person at the receiving end of the joke did not understand it? If so, then you have firsthand experience in understanding how cognitive ability can affect the way in which information is interpreted.

Bias Our biases obviously affect our ability to interpret information we receive. For example, we can hate a political candidate so much that we can refuse to process any of the positive information we hear about her. We do, however, process every piece of information that is consistent with our opinion.
