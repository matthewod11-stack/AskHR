This study compliments the exiting literature by providing empirical analysis on South Asian countries only as the exiting studies contain large number of countries but do not have China and South Africa in their list which is the major recipient of FDI in the world. In this study the dependent variable is FDI, net inflow (BOP in current US $ and independent variable is Export and import of goods and service, GDP per capita (current US$), official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average / consumer price).Real effective Exchange rate is taken for the more accurate results.

and to provide more efficient estimation and information of the parameters. Panel data technique is used because of its advantage over cross section al and time series analysis in using all the informati on available,which are not detectable in pure cross sections or in pure time series. Battag and kao (2000), Hsiao (1958, 1986) and Baltagi (1995) argued panel data sets posses several major advantages.Panel dat a suggests individual heterogeneity to deducted the risk of producing biased result and revised a large number of data points to enhance the degree of freedom and variability and to be able to study the dynamic of adjustments. The panel data model includes three different methods.

Based on the above hypotheses posed, the estimation model is as follow:

Where, LFDI : Log value of Foreign Direct Investment LGDP :: Log value of Gross Domestic Product Per capita LE &I :: Log value of Export and Import of goods and services LOER: Log value of Official exchange rate This study comprise analysis of eight emerging economies of the world know as South Asian countries

- 4. Panel Data Analysis The panel data estimation is employed in the study to capture the dynamic behavior of the parameters

- 1) Random effects 2) Fixed effect

- 3) Common constant method

The panel data estimation is employed in the study for the SAARC to capture dynamic behavior of the parameter and to provide more efficient estimation and information of the parameter. Here the Hausman test (1978). Prove that we have to use the random affect model for the analysis. Random affect model assist in controlling for unobserved heterogeneity when the heterogeneity is constant over time and not correlated with independent variables. This constant can be removed from the data through differencing, for example by taking a first difference which will remove any time invariant components of the model.
