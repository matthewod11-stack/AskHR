## HBR / The Big Idea / How to Weigh the Risks of Disclosing a Disability

disability needs; this is why a network of other potential advocates

might be necessary.

Human resources. Discussing your health challenges with HR usually

maximizes the likelihood that your rights under disability laws like the

ADA will be protected. In many organizations, HR is best positioned

to provide guidance on available accommodations and resources.

Unfortunately, in others HR accommodation procedures are extremely

diﬃcult to navigate; getting assistance from some of the oﬃces below

might be useful.

Accessibility ofﬁce. At some organizations, ensuring that work

environments meet employees’ needs is the responsibility of a separate

oﬃce. The accessibility oﬃce or oﬃcer can help you navigate

the accommodation process, ensure that your needs are addressed promptly and eﬀectively, and provide resources and guidance.

DEI or DEIA ofﬁces. While disability is not always prominent among

DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives, it is a form of diversity,

and disability inclusion is a DEI responsibility. The DEI team can serve

as an advocate and ally to promote your well-being and professional

growth. This is particularly likely if your DEI oﬃce is explicitly

responsible for “A,” the accessibility part of DEIA.

Coworkers. Disclosing your health challenges to at least some of

your colleagues allows them to understand any accommodations or

adjustments you may need, and this understanding may help them

develop a more empathetic perspective. Sharing your experiences with coworkers can also create a network of allies who can oﬀer support

when needed.
