# alarm.” (G14)

This informant also noted that the employee has been kept for more than a year, not

because of his contribution to the business, but because of his contacts which helped them to

maintain the government contract. In this informant’s experience, the worker came to be

designated as part of the “protected group” of workers, who in theory could not be fired

because of the risk of losing contracts and connections with government officials to the

business. To some co-workers, the continuous employment of such individuals is shrouded in

mystery into which they have limited insight.

By the same token, the data from Nigeria also suggest that many of those interviewed

pointed to corruption as one of the main reasons why organisations persist with

underperforming employees in Nigeria. Many pointed out that underperforming employees

are not only retained in employment, but promoted because of their loyalty in paying

“homage” and presenting gifts as bribes to those in leadership positions. When the

interviewer told them that corruption existed in all parts of the world, virtually all the

informants retorted that it is a norm rather than an exception in Nigeria.

Another aspect of our findings indicates that some of the workers were recruited by

the new executive teams and portrayed as the up-and-coming star performers. Over time such

workers failed to deliver and eventually came to be seen as underperforming. However, some

of the top management often fail to admit defeat and worry that firing such workers could

damage their reputation and judgement. Consequently, the executive persist with such

workers to protect their reputation. As one informant noted:

“They just want to save face … XXX employed him two years ago but we haven’t seen

anything yet … XXX won’t fire him.” (G14)

A director of a major automobile marketing company in Lagos (N39) referred to some

aspects of organisational culture as being responsible for the persistence of underperforming

employees in his organisation. He said the fear of diffusion of business secrets, especially by

senior managers, has led to keeping them as employees even when they have begun to

underperform. Table 3 provides a summary of how underperforming workers have come to

be viewed as “imposed workers” and possessing “unfulfilled potentials”. As illustrated in the

table, persistence with underperforming workers can stem from their imposition from an

external force over which management have limited or no control. In some of the case of the

oil multinationals, persistence were at time attributed to governmental contracts requiring

foreign firms to have a quota of local employees. As one government official (N36) in

Nigeria with several years of experiences noted,

“We make it clear to them (Western multinationals) that they have to hire more local workers

not only labourers, but also as senior managers, if they want to succeed here”.

This guideline was noted to have influenced demand for executive-level and blue-collar
