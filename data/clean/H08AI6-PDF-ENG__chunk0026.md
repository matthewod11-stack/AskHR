## Since feelings of ﬁnancial precarity create pressure, beneﬁts such as

savings programs and mortgage assistance can help, as well as making

payments toward employee student loans, or allowing employees to

choose their beneﬁts and perks so that compensation is customized to

their individual needs. Second, to encourage family-motived employees

to take risks, organizations could strive to create a psychologically

safe environment in which employees do not feel they will be viewed

negatively and at risk of losing their job if they speak up or take creative

risks. Leaders could explicitly assure employees that such risks are

valued and will not threaten their job’s stability.

The poet Maya Angelou wrote, “I sustain myself with the love of family.”

As a key force in life, love of family drives the choices we make at work

and shapes how we spend our work time. Organizations that embrace

family at work stand to beneﬁt from attracting and retaining employees

who are highly motivated and engaged.
