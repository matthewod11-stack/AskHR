# the asymptotic model

(DeJong, 1957),

Even with the variety of possible approaches to modeling learning curves that have been created, the Wright model is the basis for all other developments, and remains the most popular approach. While abundant research has worked at improving, extending, and applying Learning Curve Theory and learning curve models, it is unquestionable that the basic premise of the theory has received extensive support, and the application of the theory has proven extremely valuable to many different industries (Belkaoui, 1986; Muth, 1986; Teplitz, 1991; Yelle, 1979).

The work on Learning Curve Theory from the operations literature has shown that organizational productivity tends to follow a speciÔ¨Åc functional form over time. As reviewed earlier, the dynamic performance literature similarly has suggested that there exist systematic and predictable relation- ships between individual-level job performance measures and time (e.g., Day et al., 2004; Deadrick et al., 1997; Ployhart & Hakel, 1998; Stewart & Nandkeolyar, 2006; Thoresen et al., 2004), but has not sought to propose a basic theoretical form for this relationship. My purpose of reviewing Learning Curve Theory in this article is that it may prove useful for the dynamic performance literature. Although individual-level performance curves of interest to dynamic performance researchers and the aggregated results-based performance curves from the operations literature are not the same, if the two are related such that evaluative performance is an unbiased indicator of results-based performance, then aggregation of evaluative
