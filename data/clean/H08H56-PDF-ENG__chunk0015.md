If the outcome remains unclear and we face a prolonged period of

and then pivoting to your business needs. You might say: “It’s stressful

for all of us that there’s no clarity about the election results. No matter

how it ultimately turns out, having a deﬁnitive outcome would provide

some comfort, allowing us to strategize and paint a picture of what the

next four years might look like. For now, though, we ﬁnd ourselves in

a state of uncertainty, which can be uncomfortable. While we all want

certainty, it’s important to set those feelings aside for the moment so we

can be there for our colleagues and customers.”
