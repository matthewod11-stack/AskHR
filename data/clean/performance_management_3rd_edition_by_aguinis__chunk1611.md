rewards it, and that creates a sense of enthusiasm for your work, and a sense of mission.”

Another program that Eaton describes as empow- ering employees at Chrysler includes requiring all employees, including executives, to participate in the process of building a new vehicle. Eaton explains that this shows all of the em- ployees in the plant that executives are concerned about the proper functioning of new cars, and it gives executives the opportunity to understand and solve problems at the factory level. Eaton states, “When we’re done with our discussions, these guys know where we want to go and how we want to get there, and they go back and put the action plans together to do that. This goes for every single thing we do.” He con- cludes, “Clearly at a company there has to be a shared

vision, but we try to teach people to be a leader in their own area, to know where the company wants to go, to know how that affects their area, to benchmark the best in the world, and then set goals and programs to go after it. We also encourage people not only to go after the business plan objectives but to have stretch goals. And a stretch goal by definition is a fifty-percent increase . . . . If we go after fifty percent, something dramatic has to happen. You have to go outside of the box.”
