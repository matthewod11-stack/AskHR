## Figure 13.3 Negotiating territory and confl ict resolution

506

chapter 

Collaborating Style An individual with a collaborating style wants to win but also wants to see the other person win. These people seek win-win solutions—that is, ways in which both sides get what they want. Though this style is probably the best to use when- ever possible, it can be time-consuming and may not be appropriate in emergen- cies (e.g., determining how best to treat a person having a heart attack).

Compromising Style The final strategy is the compromising style. The user of this type adopts give- and-take tactics that enable each side to get some of what it wants but not every- thing it wants. Most conflicts are resolved through some form of compromise so that a solution benefits both sides. Compromising usually involves a good deal of negotiation and bargaining. The negotiation process begins with each side making an offer that asks for much more than it really wants. For example, union leaders might demand $ an hour, while management offers $ an hour. Each side understands what the other is doing, so the union might lower its demand to $ and management might raise its offer to $. This process continues until an acceptable compromise has been reached.

An acceptable compromise is one that falls within the settlement range for both sides (Acuff, ). According to Acuff, a settlement range is between the least acceptable result (LAR) and the maximum supportable position (MSP) for each side. The LAR is the lowest settlement that a person is willing to accept; it must be realistic and satisfy the person’s actual needs. The MSP is the best pos- sible settlement that a person can ask for and still reasonably support with facts and logic. The MSP is usually the negotiator’s initial offer. A short-order cook’s proposal for $ an hour would not be reasonably supportable and thus would not be a proper MSP.

As shown in Figure ., negotiations usually begin with each side offering its MSP as an opening bid. The actual negotiating territory is the area between both sides’ LARs. Each side then bargains for a settlement closest to its own MSP and the other’s LAR. The final settlement will be a function of the skill of each nego- tiator as well as of time pressures. Such pressures may be exerted by customers who cannot wait for a settlement or by union members who cannot financially afford prolonged negotiations.
