## reports to the CEO and board members with conﬁdence and poise.

Because of the added responsibilities required of a level three CoS,

it is crucial that onboarding include a careful review of the culture,

including who has inﬂuence and why, the leader’s style and personality,

and the board’s expectations for change.

When ﬁrst establishing the CoS position, it is also important to prepare

the organization. The CEO’s executive assistant should understand the

CoS role, because she or he sits upstream in the ﬂow of information and

will continue to handle routine duties that support the chief of staﬀ’s

activities. More critical is ensuring that the leader’s other direct reports

understand why the role was created, how they and the company will

beneﬁt from it, and what the CEO expects from them in terms of

support. If these issues are ignored, adding a CoS can upset the balance

of working relationships at the most senior level of the company—a

place where status, power, and access are always delicate matters and

are carefully calibrated.

Two ﬁnal factors will determine whether incorporating a CoS into the chief executive’s oﬃce will improve things. First, is the leader willing

to make some changes to his or her routine once the chief of staﬀ is

aboard? If the CEO is used to being his or her own chief of staﬀ and

continues to act in that way after hiring one, not even the best aide will

succeed. Second, will the two of them have a relationship that allows

the eﬀective giving and receiving of feedback? From the very outset,

the CEO should make a deal with the new CoS: If she hones her ability

to give feedback, the CEO will be open to it and listen carefully. The
