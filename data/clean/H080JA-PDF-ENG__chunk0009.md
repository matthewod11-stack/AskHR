## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Redefine Our Gendered Idea of “Ambition”

Women typically make the sacriﬁce for the couple by reverting to

but they can’t or won’t submit to the grind.

ignored, or because the culture only supports a one-size-ﬁts-all

approach to ambition, it’s a loss not only for them but the companies

they work for.
