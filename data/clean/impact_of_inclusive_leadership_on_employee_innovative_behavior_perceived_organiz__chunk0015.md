## Impact of inclusiveleadershipon employeeinnovativebehavior

[34–36]. Employee innovative behavior focused on the innovation process, (i.e., engaging in innovative activities) rather than the innovation outcome (i.e., new products) [6,37], which was beyond the concept of creativity [7]. In this study, we followed Shin, Yuan, and Zhou’ (2017) research, “draw from the literature about innovative behavior in general, including the literature on creativity”, to develop our theoretical model [7]. For decades, several types of leadership have been demonstrated to influence employee innovative behavior in organiza- tions [38]. Amabile et al. (1996) proposed that freedom, supervisory encouragement, and orga- nizational support were closely related to innovation [39].

From theoretical perspectives, inclusive leadership can stimulate employee innovative

behavior in multiple ways. First, inclusive leaders can energize employees to engage in innova- tive process [40]. Conger and Kanungo considered inclusion as a process of improving inter- nal perception of organization employees and as a concept related to intrinsic motivation [41]. Increasing motivation leaded to more involvement in innovative behavior [40,42]. Second, based on organizational support theory [43], employees’ work outcomes relied on organiza- tional support. Inclusive leaders were able to provide resources including information, time, and support necessary for innovative behavior [44]. “Leader inclusiveness is directed toward encouraging and valuing the different viewpoints of diverse members within team interac- tions” [27]. When employees were supported by their leader, they would get more autonomy and freedom to engage in innovative behavior [45]. Boren argued that inclusion was based on employees’ basic trust, explaining that managers use various skills to improve the capacity and potential of subordinates’ behavior [46]. In addition, Randel et al (2018) stated that the inclusive leadership might facilitate organization employees perceiving belongingness (by supporting team members, ensuring justice and equity, and sharing decision-making) in the organization while maintaining their uniqueness (by encouraging diverse contributions and helping team members fully contribute) within the organization as they fully contribute to the organization processes and outcomes of innovation (i.e. creativity) [18]. Third, inclusive lead- ers could serve as role models for innovative behaviors [47]. Nembhard and Edmondson sug- gested that leader inclusiveness was positively related to engagement in quality improvement work [24]. Carmeli et al. argued that inclusive leadership demonstrated a specific relationship exhibited through openness and harmony in communication, accessibility, and offering [17]. Through appropriate inclusiveness, leaders created an environment where employees had a greater sense of responsibility [48], had more decision-making autonomy, and received more information and feedback as well as support and encouragement [49]. General openness, avail- ability, and accessibility facilitated employee involvement in innovative work [17]. Innovative behavior was often noted as “discretionary behavior” [34]. Inclusive leadership’s unique fea- tures reshaped followers’ perception of support and enhanced more innovative behavior [18]. Thus, based on organizational support theory [43], we formulated the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: Inclusive leadership is positively related to employee innovative behavior.

Perceived organization support

Eisenberger and Stinglhamber proposed that POS referred to "employees develop global beliefs concerning the extent to which the organization values their contributions and cares about their wellbeing" (1986: 501) [43]. POS was grounded in the theory of organizational support, underlining the importance of viewing employees as valued organizational assets [23]. New areas of research emphasized organizational support as an important factor affecting employ- ees’ willingness to contribute to the organization [50]. Inclusive leadership represented an important organizational aspect that can assist in creating a more innovation-supportive work environment [17,51], but our conceptual understanding of the supportive mechanisms
