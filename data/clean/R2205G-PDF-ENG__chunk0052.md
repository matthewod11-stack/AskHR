# WORK/LIFE BALANCE

So the question is: Would you rather have to cope with the disruption of a planned leave or the disruption of a sudden resignation?

With a little ingenuity, managers can cover for workers on leave. At Tennessee’s First Horizon Bank, for example, to make up for a person’s absence on a team under a deadline, managers might ask a junior staﬀ member to take on a chal- lenging, visible part of the assignment. Or they might look for someone who is coming oﬀ another project and has time to spare. Not giving a staﬀ member time oﬀ for a pressing family need is considered unacceptable.

on Black men and Hispanic and Asian American women are not statistically signiﬁcant.) That men as well as women beneﬁt from leaves attests to the needs and wants of work- ing fathers. Paid leaves would have even broader eﬀects, because more workers could aﬀord to take time oﬀ. Again, it’s no surprise that as these programs enable more women and people of color to move into management, the share of white men decreases.
