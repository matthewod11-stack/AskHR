# Training Coaches at Hallmark

Hallmark (http://www.hallmark.com) sought to improve management communications with employees and initiated a training program that has been well received and viewed as a strategic benefit to the company. U.S.-based Hallmark is a retailer and wholesaler of greeting cards, stationery, flowers, and gifts with operations in the United States and Great Britain. The company initiated train- ing to help managers become more effective in communications, enhancing their ability to provide leadership and coaching to employees. The training program sought to provide skill development in increasing two-way communication, with a greater frequency of communication and increased inter- action of managers with employees. Training sessions included self-assessment, small group role-play- ing, and viewing video clips to enhance understanding of the role of communication. Engagement training focused on gaining the trust of employees as well as their involvement and ownership in busi- ness outcomes. Follow-up resources were also made available for managers to continue to improve their leadership competency. Following the training in this area, managers gave positive feedback, and employee surveys have shown that employee engagement has increased at all levels of the organiza- tion. In summary, Hallmark provides an example of a company that made a commitment to leadership and coaching through training managers and focusing on communication skills that has translated into a more engaged workforce and enhanced strategic business results.16

Chapter 8included a discussion of developmental goals and developmental resources and strategies. Letâ€™s discuss the two remaining components of the coaching model: observ- ing and documenting developmental behavior data and giving feedback.
