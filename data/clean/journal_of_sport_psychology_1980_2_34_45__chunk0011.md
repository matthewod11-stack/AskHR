# Internal Consistency and Reliability

As an index of internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha was calculated for each subscale. These coefficients are presented in Table 2 and are considered accepta- ble. Though the coefficient was lower for Autocratic Behavior preferred by the athletes (.45) it was adequate for the other two sets of data. It should also be noted that the other coefficients are generally higher in the case of the athletes' perception of leader behavior than in the other two data sets.

For the estimation of test-retest reliability, 53 of the physical education majors responded to the revised questionnaire a second time after an interval of 4 weeks. The composite factor scores (i.e., the sum of the selected items in each factor) were used to calculate the reliability coefficients. These reliability coeffi- cients were adequate and ranged from .71 (Social Support) to .82 (Democratic Behavior).
