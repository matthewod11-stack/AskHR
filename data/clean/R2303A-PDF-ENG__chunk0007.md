# than 400 people with disabilities.

The mission of our business is to put people with disabilities—either

congenital or acquired—to work. We’d love to see more entrepreneurs

follow in our footsteps. But we also believe that any organization can

open its doors to people with disabilities—and can regard them as

a competitive advantage. In fact, all corporate diversity, equity, and

inclusion (DEI) strategies should include a commitment to broadening

the talent pool in this way. We’ve learned through experience how

to overcome challenges, get the best from our team members, and

capitalize on all the value they provide. Our kids motivated us to make a

diﬀerence. We hope we can do the same for you.
