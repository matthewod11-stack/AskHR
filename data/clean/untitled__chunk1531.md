# 264 Psychology of Women and Gender

remains, however, to translate that evidence into a form that will be effective and persuasive.

Every movement for social change meets resistance. The ﬁeld of the psychology of women and gender is no exception. Such resistance is an inevitable reaction to any struggle for change. In psychology, the resistance includes disdain for work on “women’s” topics and for feminist journals. Women, the majority of humankind, are still considered a special pop- ulation; research on women is seen as failing to contribute to psychological knowledge about human behavior. An analysis of psychology journal articles showed that when researchers used an all-female (versus an all-male) sample, they were more likely to provide a justiﬁcation for a single-sex sample and to point out that their results could not be generalized to the other sex (Ader & Johnson, 1994). Finally, many feminist psychologists value collaboration and interdisciplinary work, research with applied potential, and the use of innovative re- search approaches. All of these draw further antipathy.
