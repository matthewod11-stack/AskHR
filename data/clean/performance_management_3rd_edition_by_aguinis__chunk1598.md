# Part III • Employee Development

- Be empathetic.

It is important for the supervisor to put herself in the shoes of the employee. The supervisor needs to make an effort to understand why the employee has performed at a certain level during the review period. This includes not making attributions that any employee success was caused by outside forces (e.g., a good economy) or that employee failures were caused by inside forces (e.g., employee incompetence). • Be open-minded.

If the employee presents an alternative and different point of view, be open-minded, and discuss them directly and openly. There is a possibility that the employee may provide information that is relevant and of which you are not aware. If this is the case, ask for specific evidence.50

- Observe verbal and nonverbal cues. The supervisor should be able to read verbal and nonverbal signals from the employee to determine whether further clarifica- tion is necessary. The supervisor should be attentive to the employee’s emotions and react accordingly. For example, if the employee becomes defensive, the super- visor should stop talking and allow the employee to express her point of view regarding the issue being discussed.

- Minimize threats. The performance review meeting should be framed as a meet- ing that will benefit the employee, not punish him.

- Encourage participation. The employee needs to have her own conversational space to speak and express her views. The supervisor should not dominate the meeting; rather, she should listen without interrupting and avoid confrontation and argument.

In spite of these suggestions, defensiveness may be unavoidable in some situa- tions. In such situations, supervisors need to recognize that employee defensiveness is inevitable, and they need to allow it. Rather than ignoring the defensive attitude, super- visors need to deal with the situation head on. First, it is important to let the employee vent and to acknowledge the employee’s feelings. To do this, the supervisor may want to pause to accept the employee’s feelings. Then, the supervisor may want to ask the employee for additional information and clarification. If the situation is reaching a point where communication becomes impossible, the supervisor may want to suggest suspending the meeting until a later time.51 For example, the supervisor may say, “I understand that you are angry and that you believe you have been treated unfairly. It’s important that I understand your perspective, but it’s difficult for me to absorb the information when you are so upset. This is an important matter. Let’s take a break, and get back together at 3:00 P.M. to continue our discussion.” To be sure, if the relationship between the supervisor and the employee is not good, the performance review meeting is likely to expose these issues in a blatant and often painful way.

Consider the following vignette. Jason is the manager at a large accounting firm, and Susan is one of the employees on his team. He chooses a conference room with privacy away from the other offices.

JASON: Hi, Susan. I wanted to meet with you today to discuss your performance

appraisal for this quarter. At any time, please offer your input and ask questions if you have any.

SUSAN: OK.

JASON:

You did meet two important objectives that we set this quarter: sales and customer service. Thanks for your hard work.
