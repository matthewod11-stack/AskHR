## discussions with 50 global professionals, and interviews with leaders

and those they lead—shows that employees looking to excel worry that shifting into spacious mode can be interpreted as a lack of eﬃciency

or urgency. As a result, it feels career-limiting, and like it requires

permission from a manager, so few employees do it regularly.

While all employees have some agency to shift to spacious mode,

leaders play a crucial role in making it more accessible at work because

they can legitimize it as a good way to spend precious time (or not).
