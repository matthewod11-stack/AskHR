# 226 Social Psychology

self as a functional property, his social was not a singular self but rather plural selves: “Properly speaking, a man has as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize him and carry an image of him in their mind” (p. 294). When he added that “To wound any one of these images is to wound him,” plurality became the essence of the individual. James claimed, for instance, that the personal acquaintances of an individual necessarily result in “a division of the man into several selves; and this may be a discordant splitting, as where one is afraid to let one set of his acquaintances know him as he is elsewhere; or it may be a perfectly harmonious division of labor, as where one tender to his children is stern to the soldiers or prisoners under his command” (p. 294). James’s social self is complex, fragile, interdependent, and diachronic: The social self is “a Thought, at each moment dif- ferent from that of the last moment, but appropriative of the latter, together with all that the latter called its own” (p. 401). The social self constitutes an object that is not readily acces- sible to scrutiny using scientiﬁc methods or explicable in simple deterministic laws of action.

James’s mercurial, complex social psychological actor bearsstrikingsimilaritiestoJamesMarkBaldwin’s(1897)so- cialindividualrenderedjust7yearslaterinSocialandEthical Interpretations in Mental Development: A Study in Social Psychology. Baldwin asserted the fundamental nature of the individual and posited that psychological phenomena could be explained only in relation to the social. In other words, the individual selfcan take shapeonly becauseof andwithin aso- cial world. Baldwin’s conceptualized “self” at once has agency to act in the world as well as being an object of that world. Delineating a “dialectic of personal growth” (p. 11), wherein the self develops through a response to or imitation of other persons, Baldwin challenged late-nineteenth-century notions of an authentic or uniﬁed self and proposed, instead, that “A man is a social outcome rather than a social unit. He isalwaysinhisgreatestpart,alsosomeoneelse.Socialactsof his—that is, acts which may not prove anti-social—are his because they are society’s ﬁrst; otherwise he would not have learned them nor have had any tendency to do them” (p. 91). Baldwin’s self was more deeply rooted in society than was James’s; yet, they shared an overriding distrust of society and consequently created a central place for ethics in their social psychologies.And like James, Baldwin was a methodological pluralist, insisting that social psychology demanded multiple methods: historical and anthropological, sociological and sta- tistical, and genetic (psychological and biological). Baldwin ultimately held that individual psychology is, in fact, social psychology because the individual is a social product and could be understood only by investigating every aspect of society, from institutions to ethical doctrines. It is in this

broader conception of the individual as a fundamentally social being that Baldwin differs most strikingly from James: His model directly suggested psychology’s social utility through its enhanced knowledge of the individual in society, and in this sense he shared closer kinship with John Dewey in the latter’s call for a practical social psychology (Collier, Minton, & Reynolds, 1991). However, in a gesture more nineteenth century than twentieth, Baldwin placed his intel- lectual faith in human change not in psychology’s discovery of techniques of social regulation but rather in a Darwinian vision of the evolution of ethics.
