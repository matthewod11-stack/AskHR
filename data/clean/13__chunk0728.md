The various direct outcomes (i.e., discretionary behavior, power, job performance and compensation) of reputation discussed above are not totally independent of one another. Those individuals responsible for making decisions about performance ratings also may be in charge of assessing promotability and salary for a particular individual. Therefore, there is inevitably going to be cross-decision biases.

in an overlapping manner, one can argue that they can be viewed as a form of resources to be gained by reputation. Because a strong, positive reputation may result in such reserves, reputation can be viewed as a manner of conserving such resources, because once a reputation is built, less energy may be spent maintaining it. The ability to replenish such resources has been shown to affect all aspects of well-being, such as burnout (Wright & Hobfoll, 2004), emotional exhaustion (Ito & Brotheridge, 2003), and stress (Hobfoll, 2001). Indeed, a powerful reputation not only helps replenish resources, but also provides opportunities to defend one’s resources.
