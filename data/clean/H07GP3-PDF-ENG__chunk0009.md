## — Interview with a male investor, August 2015

Venture capital is a man’s game. Women are massively under-

represented among both venture-backed entrepreneurs and VC

investors, with companies founded solely by women receiving less

than 3% of all venture capital investments and women accounting for

less than 15% of check-writers. It’s a vicious cycle: If VCs are more

comfortable “betting on somebody that looks like them,” it’s hardly

surprising that investors — who are majority male — are much more

likely to bet on startups led by men.

In response to these disheartening statistics, policy makers, business

leaders, and investor groups have advocated for getting more women

involved in venture ﬁnancing. The idea behind these eﬀorts is that if

men won’t invest in women, then women will do it themselves — and

will ultimately reap the beneﬁts of investing in female talent that would

otherwise have been overlooked.

At ﬁrst glance, this approach makes sense. Studies have shown that

female investors are indeed more likely than male investors to invest

in female entrepreneurs. But our recent research suggests that support

from female investors may be a mixed blessing, because it may actually

make it harder for female founders to raise additional rounds of

ﬁnancing.

We analyzed more than 2,000 venture-backed ﬁrms in the United States

and found that women-led ﬁrms whose ﬁrst round of VC funding was

raised exclusively from female VC partners were two times less likely

than those whose ﬁrst round included male partners to eventually raise
