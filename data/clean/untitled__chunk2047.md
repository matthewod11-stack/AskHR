# 362 Counseling Psychology

Northwestern brought important dividends. The VA re- sponded by creating two new positions for psychologists, Counseling Psychologist (Vocational) and Counseling Psy- chologist (Vocational Rehabilitation and Education). Under the leadership of Robert Waldrop, the VA sought to help uni- versities establish counseling psychology doctoral training programs that would complement existing clinical psychol- ogy training programs. The APA followed suit and began to accredit counseling psychology doctoral training programs in 1951. Along with this would come the need for counseling psychologists to pass through those rites of passage that de- Ô¨Åne a profession, including issues of professional ethics, li- censure, and the like. All in all, it seemed that counseling psy- chology was starting to come into its own.
