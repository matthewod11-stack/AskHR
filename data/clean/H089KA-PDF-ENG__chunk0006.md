The underrepresentation of women of color in technology continues to

be a persistent issue. “While 27% of computing roles in the U.S. market

are held by women, just 3% and 2% are held by African-American and

Hispanic American/Latina women respectively,” according to a research

report from Accenture. And “women overall leave tech roles at a 45%

higher rate than men.” Given these dismal statistics, tech companies

must invest in ensuring women of color are retained in the workplace.
