weaknesses. Feedback helps the recipient to identify strengths which he/she can build upon. The use of 3608 feedback instruments provides peers/co-workers with the opportunity to praise or criticise their colleagues anonymously. A number of studies have been undertaken to assess whether productivity and performance actually improve as a result of adopting a multi-source assessment system. Edwards and Ewen (1996) report that there were productivity improvements among university faculty and improved customer satisfaction ratings following the implementation of 3608 feedback.

Bernardin et al. (1993) suggest that a multi-rater system that incorporates a number of raters such as one's boss, subordinates and peers is more useful for the feedback recipients than only one source of feedback. The aim of this research was to explore the attitudes of supervisors to subordinate appraisal and they found that several of the managers who participated in the study argued that subordinate appraisal can only be clearly interpreted in the context of other information such as appraisals from other sources. Therefore, it follows that, if an organisation has subordinate appraisal or peer appraisal in operation, a more useful and more effective system of feedback is a 3608 process involving a number of raters rather than relying on one source.

The Handy et al. (1996) study found that

users of the 3608 feedback process were positive about the tool's value reporting that 75 per cent of respondent organisations judge it to be successful. Of managers who had experienced the 3608 feedback process, 92 per cent found it helpful because it is a more effective form of performance appraisal than the traditional top-down model. They conclude that 3608 feedback can address some of the deficiencies which impede the effectiveness of the top-down approach to performance appraisal.

Hoffman (1995) enumerates several reasons

why companies should adopt 3608 feedback. These include: .

an increased focus on customer service; the promotion of team-building and team- work; the creation of a high-involvement workforce; the detection of barriers to success; assessment of developmental needs; the identification of performance thresholds; and the definition of corporate competencies,

thereby highlighting what the organisation values and rewards. However, these espoused advantages of 3608 feedback have not been empirically tested.

Hazucha et al. (1993) found that participants

in their study report that particular developmental activities are most effective for the enhancement of skill development. Particular dimensions include: reviewing plans and progress, obtaining input into development plans from co-workers and receiving feedback and coaching. Therefore, 3608 feedback, brings with it a number of advantages which range from more open communication channels at an organisational level to an excellent career development strategy at an individual level. However, there are problems and limitations associated with the process. These problems and limitations are discussed below.

Difficulties associated with 36088 feedback

One of the major challenges facing the introduction of multi-source feedback is that employees may feel threatened by the assessment (London et al., 1990). This is especially true if the organisational culture has traditionally been bureaucratic and hierarchical. A move away from traditional methods and processes that employees are used to can lead to fear and rejection of the new initiative. Murphy and Cleveland (1991) claim that hierarchical organisations present difficult contexts for 3608 feedback programmes and consequently subordinate and peer appraisals in these organisations are generally not well received.

An inevitable issue with multi-source appraisal is that the feedback ratings may not always be positive and may even be quite negative (London et al., 1990). Some managers when presented with negative feedback about their performance become defensive and the feedback demotivates them, which in turn has negative consequences for the organisation (Kaplan, 1993). London and Beatty (1993) highlight that multi-source feedback raises the stakes for a manager and that the process places pressure on the employee's self-concept.

Survey fatigue is another problem that arises with the adoption of 3608 feedback (Bracken, 1996; Kaplan, 1993; London and Beatty, 1993). It is common for organisations to utilise numerous surveys and questionnaires to evaluate, for example, customer and/or employee satisfaction. A fundamental element of the 3608 feedback process is that the feedback recipient is rated
