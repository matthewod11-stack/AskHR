ABSTRACT:

A key component of human resource management, employee selection and recruiting is crucial to the success of an organization. This multidimensional process entails finding, luring, and employing people who have the abilities, credentials, and characteristics required to thrive inside the company's culture and contribute to its objectives. Various phases, including job analysis, sourcing, screening, interviewing, and decision-making, are included in efficient recruitment techniques. Aligning candidates with job needs and assessing their potential for long-term growth and flexibility are two competing objectives that employers must manage. The incorporation of technology, social media, and data-driven approaches has also greatly changed the recruitment scene in recent years. While these developments have sped up the process, they have also raised issues with privacy and diversity. In the end, personnel selection and recruitment have an impact on an organization's performance, productivity, and overall competitiveness in the changing global labour market. They also affect immediate employment needs.
