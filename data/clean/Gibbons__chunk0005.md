### **Stage 4: Creating feedback loops**

Static human-AI teams quickly become obsolete as both technology and
business needs evolve. You need deliberate feedback mechanisms that
enable continuous improvement of the collaboration.

This means tracking not just outcomes but the process of collaboration
itself. Which types of prompts generate the most useful AI outputs?
Where does human intervention most improve AI recommendations? When does
AI assistance actually diminish human performance by creating
overreliance?

A legal firm discovered through systematic tracking that junior
associates using AI for research became better at identifying relevant
precedents but worse at constructing novel arguments. They adjusted
their workflow to use AI for discovery but required human-only sessions
for strategy development.
