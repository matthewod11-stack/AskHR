## HBR / Digital Article / The Art of Setting Expectations as a Project Manager

Yet training on “expectations management” is fairly limited within

professional development curriculum and new hire onboardings. It’s

a diﬃcult concept to package into a single educational experience

because everyone’s expectations are unique and often deeply personal.

PMs need to use a combination of intuition, listening, iterating, and

learning on the ﬂy to address them successfully.

I’ve spent the past few years gaining a deep understanding of

how people work through setbacks while interviewing leaders across

industries and researching the psychology behind this phenomenon

for my book, The Setback Cycle. Part of working through that cycle is

developing a clear understanding of expectations.
