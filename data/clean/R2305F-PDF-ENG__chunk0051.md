Zoomers (in their teens to mid twenties) were the ﬁrst generation to

grow up surrounded by social media. With YouTube channels and

TikTok platforms they came of age in a world of constant informal

feedback. Zoomers learned to post something on social media in the

morning and watch reactions come in all day long. They are more

likely to expect to give and receive frequent, real-time feedback in all

directions (subordinate to boss, peer to peer, and so on).

The cross-generational tensions these diﬀerences engender are

captured nicely by the experience of Richard, a business writer in his

late ﬁfties who works in a major media group. Recently he attended a

session where all the members of his department took turns giving one

another feedback on their current projects. First a couple of other senior

colleagues gave Richard both praise and tips for improving his work.

Then it was Connor’s turn.
