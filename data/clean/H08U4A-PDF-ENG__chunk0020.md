# A Management Discipline

Beyond senior leaders, kindness should become part of everyday

management throughout the organization. All managers must

understand it’s not optional. They should treat it as part of the job, and

they should be held accountable for doing so.

Ultimately, managers are responsible for how their teams perform

and collaborate across the organization. In a study of 51 work teams

at a manufacturing company published in 1999, one of us (Amy

Edmondson) and her team found that psychological safety was the

single most important factor in team performance—measured by two

surveys: of the teams, who were asked to assess their own performance,

and of the recipients of the teams’ work (either a manager or a

downstream internal customer), who were asked to rate it. This ﬁnding

was echoed by Project Aristotle, a Google initiative that explored what

made that company’s 180 teams eﬀective or not: It found that the

highest-performing teams—in terms of metrics related to productivity,

achieving deadlines, and work quality—had exceptional levels of

psychological safety. All team members were aﬀorded opportunities

to speak and share ideas and demonstrated that they cared for and

supported one another.
