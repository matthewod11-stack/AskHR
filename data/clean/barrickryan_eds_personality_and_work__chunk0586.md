# Directions for Future Research

Alternative theoretical perspectives provide some interesting ideas for future research. One is the notion that in a team setting, an individual’s environment is predominantly composed of other team members. An interesting question is whether the traits of a team member inﬂuence the behavior of other team members. Ev- idence that this occurs is found in theory developed by LePine and Van Dyne (2001). In their model, team member responses to a low performer depend on attributions. A team member low in Consci- entiousness evokes an internal attribution of high controllability. Teammates see the low-conscientious person as able but unwilling to perform at a higher level and thus respond with behavior aimed at providing either encouragement and motivation or rejection in the form of criticism. In contrast, a highly conscientious team mem- ber who is not performing well evokes either external attributions or peer behavior directed toward training. The conscientiousness of team members thus inﬂuences the behavior of their teammates.
