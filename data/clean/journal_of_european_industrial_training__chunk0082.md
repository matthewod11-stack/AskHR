# Fourth, a formalised self-appraisal

component on the appraisal process can help to reduce subordinate ambiguity regarding performance standards/goals and managerial expectations (Farh et al., 1988; Keeping et al., 1999). Keeping et al. (1999) do, however, suggest that there are a number of

other potential benefits of including the ratee in the rating process such as greater perceptions of fairness, accuracy, acceptance and satisfaction with the system.

While the advantages outlined are considerable and tend to support the adoption of self-rating in the performance management process, a number of disadvantages are associated with self- appraisal. Keeping et al. (1999) highlight that there are relatively few experimental investigations to support these arguments. Roberson et al. (1993) suggest that many of the potential benefits of self-appraisal are speculative rather than definitive.

Rating error is particularly salient in the

context of self-appraisal. Fox et al. (1994) argue that self-appraisal is particularly prone to leniency and halo errors. Leniency bias refers to the degree to which raters hand out undeservedly high scores to themselves. Studies suggest that self-ratings are much more inflated than are ratings from any other sources such as subordinates, peer and supervisors (Klimoski and London, 1974; Holzbach, 1978; Fox and Dinur, 1988). Farh and Werbel (1986) and Thornton (1980) report that self-appraisals that are conducted for administrative purposes are more lenient than those used for non-administrative purposes (e.g. research). Halo bias refers to ratings which do not demonstrate appropriate differentiation between rating dimensions (Holzbach, 1978).
