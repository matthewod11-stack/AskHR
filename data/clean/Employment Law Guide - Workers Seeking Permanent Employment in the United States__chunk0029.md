# Employee Rights

All appropriate protections under U.S labor laws apply to workers who received their permanent residency based on a permanent labor certiﬁcation from the Department of Labor.

There is no poster requirement. However, employers must provide notice of the ﬁling of the application and be able to document

that notice was provided, if requested. Notice must be provided between 30 and 180 days before an application is ﬁled.

Notice must be given to:

The bargaining representative, if any, of the employer's employees in the occupational classiﬁcation for which the certiﬁcation is being sought in the employer's location of intended employment;

Employees at the facility or location of employment, if there is no bargaining representative; and

Household employees, only if one or more U.S. worker is employed.
