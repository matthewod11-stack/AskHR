# Autonomous Agents

The new AI agents take kaizen to a new level, not only oﬀering advice

but making decisions, taking action, and improving processes on their

own. They range from simple chatbots to self-driving cars to robotic

systems that can run complex workﬂows autonomously.

Consider DoNotPay, a company that aims to help consumers save

money by performing a range of tasks from contesting parking tickets

to canceling time-share memberships. Until recently, DoNotPay simply

identiﬁed opportunities for customers to save money and encouraged

them to act. But then the company integrated GPT-4 and AutoGPT into

its software. The ﬁrst user of these new features was DoNotPay’s CEO.

He gave the agent access to his ﬁnancial accounts and prompted it with

a concise yet complex command: Find me money. The agent discovered

$81 in unnecessary subscriptions and an unusual $37 in-ﬂight Wi-Fi fee. Then it oﬀered to automatically cancel the subscriptions, drafted

a letter to contest the Wi-Fi charges, and checked in with the CEO

for review. As icing on the cake, it even drafted and sent emails that

negotiated a 20% reduction in the CEO’s cable and internet bill.

Gen AI is transforming the ways humans interact with complex physical systems, from robots to the human body to organizations like hospitals.

Traditional software is driven by precise, rule-based instructions and

programmed to produce predictable outcomes. That signiﬁcantly limits

its ability to act autonomously. It lacks the capacity for humanlike
