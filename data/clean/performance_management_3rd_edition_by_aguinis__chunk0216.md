matrices and forms is now spent talking with the employees about how they can improve their performance, allowing for progress on an ongoing basis. This serves a developmental purpose.

Although multiple purposes are possible, a survey of industrial and organizational psychologists working in HR departments in more than 100 different organizations reported that the two most frequent purposes are administrative (i.e., salary decisions) and developmental (i.e., to identify employees’ weaknesses and strengths). Overall, in the organizations that participated in this study, performance management served at least two of the purposes mentioned earlier.42 As will be discussed in Chapter 9, these purposes place conflicting demands on the raters because they must be both judges (i.e., make salary decisions) and coaches (i.e., provide useful feedback for performance improvement) at the same time.

Now, think about the performance management system implemented in your organization or the last organization for which you worked. Table 1.4 summarizes the various purposes served by a performance management system. Which of these purposes are being served by the system you are considering?
