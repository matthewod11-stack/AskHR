# Job Sharing

Job sharing is offered by % of organizations (Burke, a) and involves two employees who share their work hours. Rather than one person working  hours each week, two employees combine their hours so that they total . At first glance, job sharing may seem to be little more than part-time work. There are, however, big psychological, if not administrative, differences.

First, part-time work usually involves lower-level jobs such as those found in the retail and restaurant industries. But job sharing allows people in such com- plex occupations as teaching and accounting to enjoy the advantages of fewer work hours.

Second, with part-time work, the performance of one employee rarely affects the performance of another. That is, the work completed by two part-time employees results from two separate jobs. But with job sharing, the work may be done by two different employees who share one job title and one position. Poor-quality work by one employee must be corrected by the other.

From a psychological standpoint, the main difference between job sharing and part-time employment is the level of employee commitment, both to the organization and to the other employee. Job-sharing programs are targeted at employees who have family responsibilities. Thus, an organization can attract a highly qualified employee who would not be able to work full time.

Furthermore, an increasing trend is for husbands and wives in similar pro- fessions to share the same position. One such situation recently occurred with a high school teaching position: The wife teaches three morning classes while her husband takes care of their two children; the husband then teaches three after- noon classes while his wife cares for their children.
