Some of my favorite sabbatical stories come from people of modest

means who were determined to make it work. One couple, both

teachers, saved up for a decade in order to travel with their children

from Arizona to the tip of Argentina — four people crammed into a

50-year-old Land Rover — on the cheap. The trip had such a big impact

on the father that he quit his teaching job to start a small business

restoring old Land Rovers.

Of course, there are many legitimate reasons not to take a sabbatical at certain points in your life. If you lack suﬃcient time or ﬁnancial

resources to fully step away from your work and routine life for

months, you’d be better oﬀ postponing until you can fully commit. In

the meantime, you can identify ways to take smaller breaks to help

you recover more regularly. But know that these comparatively brief

moments are not shortcuts to the outsize beneﬁts around purpose and

happiness that I’ve observed among sabbatical alumni.
