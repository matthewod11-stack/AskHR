# Summary Points

- A team is in place when two or more people interact dynamically and inter- dependently and share a common and valued goal, objective, or mission. Indi- viduals can be members of the same team even if they work in different organizations and different geograph- ical locations. Teams are pervasive in today’s organizations, and it would be difficult to find an organization in which some type of work was not done by teams.

- Including team performance as part of the performance management system is a natural extension of a system that focuses on individual performance only. The general principles that we have discussed in this book thus far still apply; however, teams differ based on the tasks they perform (from routine to nonroutine) and based on mem- bership configuration (from static to dynamic). Measures of team perform- ance need to take into account the type of team being evaluated.

- Because teams are so pervasive, it is important that the performance manage- ment system focus not only on individ- uals but also on teams. Organizations should take proactive steps to make sure that teams perform well, that their performance improves on an ongoing basis, and that individuals are active and motivated contributors to their teams.

- We must consider six basic principles in including a team component in a performance management system: Make sure teams are really teams, make the investment to measure, define measurement goals clearly, use a multi- method approach to measurement, focus on process as well as outcomes, and measure long-term changes.

- Including a team component in the performance management system has some unique challenges. The system needs to achieve a good balance between individual and team perform- ance measurement and reward. In other words, it is not sufficient to measure and reward overall team performance. There also needs to be a way to measure and reward the contribution that each individual makes to the team. In this way, individuals are held accountable for contributing to team performance. • A performance management system that includes a team component needs to focus on three types of performance: (1) individual performance, (2) individual performance that contributes to team
