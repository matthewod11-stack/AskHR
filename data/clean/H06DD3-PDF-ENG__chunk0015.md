# Creating a Culture of Mobility

Give managers incentives. The ﬁrst key to changing this dynamic is to

reevaluate how an organization recognizes and rewards its managers. In a

select percentage of some of the best companies in the world, it’s

understood that to consistently rotate talent — especially high-potential

talent — they need to build it into a manager’s performance objectives and

make this part of the performance review process. These organizations

often loudly provide internal recognition and compensate managers for

their ability to both develop people and provide them opportunities for

further development. In short, they build a culture where mobility is

expected, and an environment that relies on this movement.
