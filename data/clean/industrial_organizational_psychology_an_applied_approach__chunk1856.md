designing and evaluating training systems

True, not everyone needs training in that dimension, but concluding that train- ing should not be conducted would be incorrect. The correct interpretation is that training should be conducted for the few employees who scored low for that dimension.

Third, the current performance appraisal system may not provide the type of information needed to conduct a training needs analysis (Herbert & Doverspike, ). As discussed in Chapter , performance appraisal systems must be specific to be useful. To practice using performance appraisal scores to conduct a person analysis, complete Exercise . in your workbook.

Surveys Another common approach to determine training needs is to design and admin- ister a survey that asks employees what knowledge and skills they believe should be included in future training (Kroehnert, ). Surveys offer several advan- tages. First, they eliminate the problems of performance rating errors, which were discussed previously. Second, employees often know their own strengths and weaknesses best. Thus, to determine what employees need, ask them. Finally, training needs can be determined with surveys even when the organization has not previously made an effort to design an effective performance appraisal sys- tem or adequate job descriptions. The main disadvantages of surveys are that employees may not be honest and the organization may not be able to afford the training suggested by the employees.

As with any type of survey, training needs surveys can be conducted in many ways. The most common method is a questionnaire that asks employees to list the areas in which they would like further or future training. Perhaps a better method is to provide a list of job-related tasks and components of knowledge and have employees rate the need for training on each. The results of these ratings are given to supervisors, who then “validate” the results. This process is used to determine whether the supervisors agree with their employees’ perceptions and to prioritize training needs.

Interviews The third method of needs analysis is the interview, which is usually done with a selected number of employees. Interviews are not used as extensively as surveys, but they can yield even more in-depth answers to questions about training needs (Patton & Pratt, ). The main advantage of interviews is that employee feel- ings and attitudes are revealed more clearly than with the survey approach. The main disadvantage of interviews is that interview data are often difficult to quan- tify and analyze (Brown, ).

Skill and Knowledge Tests The fourth way to determine training needs is with a skill test or a knowledge test. Some examples of areas that could be tested to determine training needs include knowledge of lending laws for loan officers, knowledge of company policy for new employees, free-throw shooting for basketball players, and the dreaded midterm exam for this course.

If all employees score poorly on these tests, training across the organization is indicated. If only a few employees score poorly, they are singled out for individual training. The greatest problem with using testing as a method to determine train- ing needs is that relatively few tests are available for this purpose. An organization

that wants to use this method will probably have to construct its own tests, and proper test construction is time-consuming and expensive.

Critical Incidents The fifth method for determining training needs is the critical-incident technique discussed in Chapters , , and . Although not a commonly used method, it will be discussed here because it is relatively easy to use, especially if a proper job analysis is available. To use this technique for needs assessment, the critical inci- dents are sorted into dimensions and separated into examples of good and poor performance, as discussed in Chapter . Dimensions with many examples of poor performance are considered to be areas in which many employees are performing poorly and in which additional training is indicated.
