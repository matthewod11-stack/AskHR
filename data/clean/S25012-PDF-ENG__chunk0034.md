optical sensor. “The algorithms do need a

human eye. Human intuition knows what

looks right,” McClelland notes. “Left to itself the algorithm can

sometimes make structures too thin.” Under the supervision of expert

human engineers, the AI then produces complex structure designs in as

little as an hour or two. In traditional mechanical design, coming up

with a design and analyzing it might take a week, followed by more

iterations until an expert assesses the design for manufacturability. So it

can take months of work to arrive at a solution. The structures designed

with AI may look a little weird, but they are two-thirds lighter and 10

times less subject to stress than components created by the traditional
