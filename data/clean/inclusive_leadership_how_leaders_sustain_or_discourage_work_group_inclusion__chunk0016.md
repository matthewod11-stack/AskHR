inclusive leaders enhanced identiﬁcation with the team which in turn im- proved team performance. Zheng, Diaz, Zheng, and Tang (2017) examined leader inclusion in China and found that leader inclusion moderates the re- lationship between deep-level similarity of the supervisor and subordinate (personality, interests, and values) and taking charge such that leader inclusion was especially important when deep-level similarity was low. Finally, Adams, Meyers, and Sekaja (2019) combined authentic, inclusive, and respectful leadership into a single measure they called positive leadership and concluded that such leaders are particularly good at fostering an employee’s work group inclusion and simultaneously reducing discrimination in both Western and non-Western contexts.
