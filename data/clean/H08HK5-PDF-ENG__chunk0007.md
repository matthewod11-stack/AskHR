## ran two experiments with more than 600 online gig workers across

multiple industries. Our ﬁnding: when you express gratitude to others

before they engage in a distressing task it helps counteract some of

the negative emotions associated with the task. Expressing gratitude early also makes employees more likely to persist through diﬃculty and

bounce back and be resilient following failure.

Our ﬁndings oﬀer insight into ways to provide meaningful gratitude

and create a culture where your employees feel their work is seen,

supported, and valued.
