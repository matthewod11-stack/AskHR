# HBR / Digital Article / 4 Ways to Meaningfully Support New Mothers Returning to Work…

- Asking for photos of the baby, inquiring about the transition to

parenthood, and sharing one’s own parental experiences are behaviors

that signal to a non-birthing parent that their new parent identity is

both recognized and valued.

These behaviors can have signiﬁcant positive implications for non-

birthing parents, even enabling them to neurologically adapt to

parenting. Thus, we encourage colleagues and managers to recognize

that postpartum allyship is not just for birthing mothers but all parents

reentering the workplace after welcoming a child into their families.

. . .

Working parents — particularly mothers — face the impossible

challenge of simultaneously being a dedicated employee and a

dedicated parent. As our interviewee Lauren explained, “you can’t be

valued as an employee and a mother. You can’t do both, which means

you just lose. You either are working too hard and you’re not taking care

of your kids enough. [Or] you are doing too much with your kids and

you’re not a good enough worker.”

It is against this backdrop that we urge employees across all levels of an

organization, and with diﬀering non-work identities, to be better allies

to parents as they return to work from parental leave. In our view, there

are few costs associated with most of the allyship behaviors uncovered

in our research, yet the beneﬁts are substantial — chief among them

being the retention of working mothers in the labor force and, that too,

in a way that allows them to truly thrive and protect their well-being.
