# 8 EXPLORING EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS IN SEARCH FUND–ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

02 Deciding whether a lawyer is necessary

Even the most thorough preparation cannot guarantee smooth sailing—especially in situations that are unique or unfamiliar. If this is a CEO’s first time navigating a termination or if there are unusual circumstances, consulting a lawyer can help ensure the right steps are being taken. Legal expertise can provide clarity, reduce risk, and help the CEO approach the situation with confidence.

Generally, ETA entrepreneurs engage employment counsel to provide preventive guidance by reviewing employee handbooks, advising on terminations, drafting employment agreements, and setting policies related to performance improvement plans, compensation, and disciplinary actions. They also depend on attorneys for dispute resolution strategies involving severance, separation agreements, or settlement offers. In addition, employment lawyers support training and compliance efforts by helping management and HR teams adopt best practices for hiring, discipline, and termination, thereby avoiding potential pitfalls.

Navigating the legal complexities of an employee termination requires the proper legal support to ensure compliance and alignment with the company’s values. When choosing a lawyer, consider several key factors. Start with general fit—the lawyer should align with the organization’s mission and values, understanding how fairness and compliance shape decisions. Their reputation among peers and clients will provide a strong indicator of expertise, while their style should balance clear, actionable advice with approachability. Availability is crucial, as terminations often require swift action, so ensure they can respond promptly. Look for domain expertise relevant to the company’s industry, as specific sectors, such as healthcare or technology, have unique legal nuances. Finally, consider cost, ensuring their pricing aligns with the enterprise’s budget and the scope of services the organization requires. Balancing these factors will help locate a lawyer who not only minimizes risk but also upholds a commitment to ethical and thoughtful decision-making.

03 Practical preparations – managing system credentials and assets

When an employee leaves an organization, especially under challenging circumstances like termination, one of the most crucial yet overlooked tasks is managing system credentials and reclaiming company assets. This is not just about logistics; it is also about protecting the organization while ensuring the offboarding process is handled professionally and respectfully. A seamless, well-organized process can reduce stress for everyone involved and maintain trust within the remaining team.

The first step is addressing system credentials. Modern businesses rely heavily on digital tools, and an employee’s departure means their access to these systems must be revoked promptly. Using onboarding and offboarding software can make this process far more efficient.24 Tools like Okta Workforce Identity and CyberArk can deactivate email accounts, revoke system access, and update directories with just a few clicks. For companies with more complex workflows, platforms like BetterCloud provide detailed offboarding checklists, ensuring that no system or access point is overlooked.

Think about the sheer number of systems an employee might use: email and communication platforms like Outlook, Slack, or Teams; cloud storage systems like Google Drive or Dropbox; and customer management tools like Salesforce. Each of these must be accounted for and secured. It can feel overwhelming, but having a detailed plan ensures that nothing slips through the cracks.
