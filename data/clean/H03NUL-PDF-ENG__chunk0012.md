Consider how, a few days after Trump’s ﬁrst travel ban, thousands of

Google employees walked out of their jobs in a day of protest. Consider, too, how Uber suﬀered a PR crisis for seeming tone-deaf immediately

following the ban. Despite CEO Travis Kalanick’s statements in support

of immigrants and refugees, many Uber employees and consumers were

furious that he still planned to attend Trump’s meeting of economic

advisors a few days later. In the wake of the #DeleteUber campaign that

followed, Kalanick stepped down from the advisory council.

In recent years technology companies have tried to convey to the public

that they will protect their consumers against government overreach.

For example, Apple has refused to give government authorities a

backdoor key to encrypted iPhones, and Microsoft recently won a

federal case wherein it refused the U.S. government’s demands to hand

over consumer data stored overseas.
