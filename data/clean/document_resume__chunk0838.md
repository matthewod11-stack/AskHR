staistical measures.14 Extremely good results halve been obtained with training pro- grams designed to build observational skills and reduce such common problems as halo effect, first impressions, patterns of leniency and strictness, recency, and similar errors.'5 Raters must fully understand the critical importance of the interpersonal aspects of performance appraisal. They must develop skills in feedback, praise, con- structive criticism, and listening. Raters also must be sensitive to the situations and conditions faced by individuals. Finally, raters must develop skills for identifying, describing, and negotiating performance expectations.

- 10. Administration. The most basic requirement is that

the performance appraisal process should support the system's goals, conflicting multiple uses should be avoided. The system could be cost effective. Expenses should be balanced against the post appraisal impact on motivation and productivity.'6 Performance appraisal admin- istration must ensure that the people who are being rated understand the mechanics, including such issues as performance expectations, how ratings on vanous criteria will be weighted, and who will actually conduct the appraisal. Finally, it is very important that performance appraisal be conducted by raters who have directed and continually observed job performance.17

- 11. Privacy and Due Process. The Federal Privacy Act of 1973 created the Privacy Protection Study Committee (PPSC), which issued a series of recommendations in 1977. Among these was the suggestion that employees should have access to all records relating to their qualifications for employment, promotion, and pay increases and to records relating to discipline and discharge. Many professional groups have recommended voluntary compliance with these recommendations. Moreover, indi- vidual access to records builds confidence in the system's basic fairness, provides an additional means of communicating results, and protects the individual's rights.18. Adverse performance ratings can lead to denial of merit pay and promotions in some cases, dismissal. Due process refers to a systematic, orderly procedure where an indi- vidual has the opportunity to object and be heard.I9 Employee rights in this area are still evolving; however, courts increasingly are requiring employers to jastify their actions.20 Legal questions aside, organizations due process is a good management practice. A formal appeal process should be established to provide an impartial review of ratings that are disputed.

- 12. Audits. Performance ratings should be analyzed periodically for evidence of discrepancies and adverse impact. Statistical tests do not prove that raters are making errors or showing bias. However, properly designed analyses can highlight certain patterns that might not be found merely by reviewing a list of ratings. When such patterns appear, management should determine the cause and, if necessary, correct the problem--particularly when members of protected groups such as blacks and females receive significantly lower ratings. In the final analysis, the effectiveness and legal defensibility of a performance appraisal system will depend on its legitima,y as a tool for making employment deci- sions. The success of any system depends on its effective administration by all levels of management. A common failure of performance appraisal systems is the assumption
