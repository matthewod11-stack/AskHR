Table 1 provides an overview of TCS and Infosys' mean and standard deviation scores on

conformity and openness, respectively. There is no significant difference between TCS and

Infosys on both conformity (0.254) and openness (0.461) as the P-value > 0.05.

The study by Chang, et al. (2023) demonstrates workplace conformance is a vital

characteristic that encourages the transmission of knowledge among Taiwan employees to

enhance their competition and creative potential. In the Indian context, however, Yadav

(2014) discovered that the intended magnitude of OCTAPACE value (usually believed to be

greater) is insignificant for all elements in sample Delhi-NCR universities. In universities

serving as examples, the expected degree of openness is less than the actual level of

openness. The P-value from the preceding table indicates and supports the study's conclusion

that openness and conformity do not differ significantly between TCS and Infosys in the Indian
