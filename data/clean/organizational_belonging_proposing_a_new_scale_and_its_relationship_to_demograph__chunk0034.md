# G. BLAU ET AL.

they did find a significant positive relationship of psychological ownership to supervisor-rated employee performance. Jena and Pradham (2018) also found a significant positive relationship between workplace belongingness and employee self-rated performance. For both samples used, Edwards and Peccei (2007) found their six-item organizational identification scale to be significantly negatively related to turnover intention. Both Davila and Garcia (2012) and Huynh et al. (2012) reported positive relationships between belonging/connectedness and one-item self-reports of intent to stay in the organization.

Based on this prior work, we would not expect significant relationships between demographic or organizational-level variables. However, is important to note that independent sample t-tests on OB-related scales for groups of employees, e.g., by gender or race, were not reported. Prior research supports expecting positive relationships between OB to both productivity and intent to stay. This leads to RQ2:

RQ2 – positive relationships are expected between OB scales to productivity and intent to stay.

Related to RQ2 would be to test if the new OB scales will explain prod- uctivity and intent to stay beyond controlled for demographic and organ- ization variables. This leads to RQ3:

RQ3 – OB scales will contribute to explaining productivity and intent to stay beyond controlled for demographic and organization variables.
