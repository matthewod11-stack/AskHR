I am grateful that I met at the department of Management and Organization so many outstanding and brilliant people: energetic Aino, intelligent Wille, genius Mats. I especially wish to thank truthful Tamara, always in a good mood Tricia, and tremendous Edyta. We are all so different and, at the same time, our friendship is a real synergy. I am also grateful to my magnificent colleagues and excellent scholars Olga, Mikko, Eric, Annamari, Tom, Matte, Hertta, Catarina, Tina, Tanja, Jennie, Jonnu, Jonna, Paulina, Linus, Christoffer, Henrika, Christina, Alexei, Markus, Saku, Pernilla, Marjut, Eero, Lotta, Henri, Heikki, Eva, and Sanne. Our chilly discussions in various places about issues you would never think about, pikkujoulus, joint trips to Jamaica and the Bahamas, conferences and ‘after-conferences’ will stay in my heart for ages.

My sincere gratitude extends to scholars of gender and other academic fields who persist in their intellectual capacity and struggle to enhance human knowledge in so many neglected and hidden areas of research.

My friends played a considerable role in my PhD process. All your jokes and questions about gender equality and the gender pay gap made my dissertation much juicier. Elena, Julia, Milla, Anastasia, Katja, Sveta, Piia, and Noora, I am glad that we are still friends after all our gender-related debates.

Parents of my husband, Sergei and Elena M., deserve a special notice. I am glad that we had so many conversations in Pernå and in many other geographical locations on the topic of ‘getting a real job’, which noticeably stimulated and accelerated my PhD writing process.

Sincere thanks go to my mama and papa for always caring about me, for strongly advising me to write a PhD, for cheering me on with the slogan ‘you can do it!’

Finally, my dear Dmitri, thank you for making my life so flowery, bright, tender, and sweet. Whatever will happen in this world, and we never know what will happen, I will love you all my life. I promise!
