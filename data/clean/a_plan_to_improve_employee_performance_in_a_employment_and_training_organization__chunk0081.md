## of the job; guidelines for performance evaluations; and, the development of key

performance objectives that supervisors can use as a guide to measure employee

performance among counseling technicians at ETR's Intake and Assessment unit.

The new performance evaluation (see Appendix A) will provide the opportunity

for both employee and supervisor to review performance criteria, outline job

expectations, and develop a plan for future improvement. It is also an appropriate time to

clarify work plans and other work processes/procedures which might affect employee

performance or the job itself. The performance evaluation should be a give-and-take

situation, with both parties providing input and feedback. Lastly, this plan proposes some

incentive for employees to improve performance through reward and recognition

suggestions (Included will be ideas management can implement in the public sector).
