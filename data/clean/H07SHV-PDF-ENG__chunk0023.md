# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

During the pandemic people started to become more isolated. They

made the best of that isolation by creating lives that were very, very

convenient, I have to say.

That said, some people do have a way better work-life balance because

they want to spend all that time with their families. The problem is all

of the people that are separated from their family and their friends and

actually not seeing people at work, that’s really catastrophic when it

comes to happiness.

ADI IGNATIUS:

The book in many ways is about agency: happiness and fulﬁllment are

not based on external variables or things that happen to us, but all very

much within our control. The problem is it’s very hard to take dramatic

actions to reorder one’s life. How do you get people who understand

they should be doing this, but who don’t? How do you make that leap?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

Part of the problem is that a lot of people notice that they can manage

their money and they can manage their company, but they can’t

manage their feelings. Or they can manage their home and they can

manage their family life, but they can’t manage their emotions. The

reason is that emotional life is a diﬀerent species of problem.

The stuﬀ around us in our work, these are complicated problems,

meaning they’re hard to ﬁgure out. But once you do, you can master

them and repeat the solutions over and over again.

Life and your emotions, the aﬀairs of the heart and the feelings that

you’re getting, positive and negative, they’re not complicated at all.
