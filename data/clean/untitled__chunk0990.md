# How Many Theories?

Given that different lists of emotions and deﬁnitions seem to appeal to different sets of emotions, one might have to con- sider the possibility that the emotion chapter contains so many disparate phenomena that different theories might be needed for different parts of the emotion spectrum. Such a possibility was hinted at even by William James, who, in presenting his theory of emotion, noted that the “only emo- tions . . . [that he proposed] expressly to consider . . . are those that have a distinct bodily expression” (James, 1884, p. 189). He speciﬁcally left aside aesthetic feelings or intel- lectual delights, the implication being that some other ex- planatory mechanism applies to those. On the one hand, many current theories of human emotion restrict themselves to the same domain as James did—the subjective experience that is accompanied by bodily “disturbances.” On the other hand, much current work deals primarily with negative emotions—and the animal work does so almost exclusively. Social and cognitive scientists spend relatively little time try- ing to understand ecstasy, joy, or love, but some do important and enlightening work in these areas (see, for example, Berscheid, 1983, 1985; Isen, 1990). Must we continue to in- sist that passionate emotional experiences of humans, rang- ing from lust to political involvements, from coping with disaster to dealing with grief, from the joys of creative work to the moving experiences of art and music, are all cut from the same cloth, or even that that cloth should be based on a model of negative emotions? There are of course regularities in human thought and action that produce general categories of emotions, categories that have family resemblances and overlap in the features that are selected for analysis (whether it is the simple dichotomy of good and bad, or the apprecia- tion of beauty, or the perception of evil).

These families of occasions and meanings construct the categories of emotions found in the natural language. The emotion categories are fuzzily deﬁned by external and inter- nal situations, and the common themes vary from case to case and have different bases for their occurrence. Sometimes an emotional category is based on the similarity of external

conditions, as in the case of some fears and environmental threats. Sometimes an emotional category may be based on a collection of similar behaviors, as in the subjective feelings of fear related to avoidance and ﬂight. Sometimes a common category arises from a class of incipient actions, as in hostil- ity and destructive action. Sometimes hormonal and physio- logical reactions provide a common basis, as in the case of lust, and sometimes purely cognitive evaluations constitute an emotional category, as in judgments of helplessness that eventuate in anxiety. Others, such as guilt and grief, depend on individual evaluations of having committed undesirable acts or trying to recover the presence or comfort of a lost per- son or object. All of these emotional states involve evaluative cognitions, and their common properties give rise to the ap- pearance of discrete categories of emotions.

It can also be argued that different theories and theorists are concerned with different aspects of an important and complex aspect of human existence. Thus, animal research is concerned with possible evolutionary precursors or parallels of some few important, usually aversive, states. Others are more concerned with the appraisal and evaluation of the ex- ternal world, while some theories focus on the cognitive con- junction with autonomic nervous system reactions. And the more ambitious try to put it all together in overarching and inclusive systems.

It may be too early or it may be misleading to assume com- mon mechanisms for the various states of high joy and low despair that we experience, or to expect complex human emo- tions to share a common ancestry with the simple emotions of humans and other animals. The question remains whether the term emotion should be restricted to one particular set of these various phenomena. Until such questions are resolved, there is clearly much weeding to be done in the jungle, much cultivation in order to achieve a well-ordered garden.
