# 172 Emotion

Darwin, who had thought so fruitfully about the expression of emotion and who knew that “expression” involved more than the face and that the viscera were crucial in the experi- ence of emotion: “Most of our emotions are so closely con- nected with their expression that they hardly exist if the body remains passive. . . . [As] Louis XVI said when surrounded by a ﬁerce mob, ‘Am I afraid? Feel my pulse.’So a man may intensely hate another, but until his body frame is affected, he cannot be said to be enraged” (Darwin, 1872, p. 239).
