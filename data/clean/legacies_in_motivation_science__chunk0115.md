We did not begin our research with theory building in mind. Because of Herzberg, we were acutely aware of the dangers of premature the- orizing (Locke, 1976, 2007; Locke & Latham, 2005). As we noted earlier, Herzberg’s database was very small, his methodology was dubious, and his results could not be replicated using different and sounder methodologies.

Often overlooked by subsequent researchers are our Appendixes C and D in Locke and Latham (1990), which present guidelines for conducting laboratory and ﬁeld experiments. Ignoring these guidelines can lead to substandard performance and erroneous conclusions. For example, as- signing impossible goals in a laboratory in- creases performance because there are no pen-
