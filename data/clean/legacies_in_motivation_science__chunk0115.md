## nition of its concept or concepts (Locke, 2003).

Key concepts require careful measurement. We discovered empirically that the best goal measure was: “What is the minimum score you would be satisﬁed with?” (An untested alterna- tive would be, “What is the lowest score you would not be dissatisﬁed with?”). Previously such measures had not been used. Usually peo- ple had simply been asked to try for X.

Several meta-analyses had been done on the effects of goals on task performance (Locke & Latham, 1990, Tables 2-1 and 2-2). These anal- yses show that people with speciﬁc, challenging goals reliably outperform those with do-your- best goals because the latter type of goal is interpreted too subjectively. Moreover, the de- gree of goal challenge or difﬁculty is linearly related to performance, given sufﬁcient skill or ability. We concluded that the most effective goals for increasing performance are those that are speciﬁc and difﬁcult. With regard to goal speciﬁcity, we found that it alone does not nec- essarily lead to high performance because a goal can be both speciﬁc and easy to attain. We found that speciﬁc goals in and of themselves affect the variance in performance only to the degree that performance is controllable.
