The study was conducted among client-facing employees in 24 oﬃces

participating in the training, which was rolled out at various times

in a randomized order. Called KPMG Globerunner, the training

was meant to deepen employees’ awareness and understanding of

the ﬁrm’s products and services so that they could better identify

business opportunities. Employees designed a character for themselves

and “raced around the world” answering questions about the ﬁrm’s

oﬀerings. A correct answer earned travel points that enabled players to

progress. Employees could also complete mini-game challenges to earn

additional points and unlock new levels. Participation was optional and

open-ended; employees could engage with the platform as frequently

and for as long as they liked.

To determine the training’s eﬀects, if any, on each oﬃce’s performance,

the researchers analyzed ﬁve measures on a monthly basis over 29

months: fees collected, the number of clients served, total business

opportunities generated, opportunities generated from existing clients, and opportunities from new clients. To measure each oﬃce’s use of

the training, they looked at how much time employees spent playing

Globerunner and the number of questions they answered. To assess

employees’ engagement with their jobs, they calculated the share of people in each oﬃce who logged on to the platform at least once
