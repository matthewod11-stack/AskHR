Even though comparing one pair of employees at a time is easier than simulta- neously comparing a large number of employees, it does have its drawbacks. With large numbers of employees, the time necessary to make all of the comparisons becomes prohibitive. For example, to determine how many comparisons must be made, we can use the following formula:

n(n − ) _______ ,  where n = the number of employees. Thus, if we have  employees to compare:

number of comparisons =

number of comparisons =

() ( − 1) __________ = 2

(10) (9) ______ 2

90 ___ = . 2

=

Thus, we would need to make  comparisons for each performance dimen- sion. Although this number is not extreme, evaluating  employees would result in , separate comparisons! And with five performance dimensions, some unfortunate supervisor would have to make almost , separate comparisons! Obviously, the supervisor would not favor such a task.

The final type of employee comparison system is called forced distribu- tion. With this method, a predetermined percentage of employees are placed in each of the five categories shown in Table .. Forced distribution systems are used by more than % of Fortune  companies (Bates, a). Also called “rank and yank,” forced distributions were a favorite method of Jack Welch, the former chief executive officer of General Electric, who required managers to fire the bottom-performing % of their employees each year. Though such systems seem harsh, the limited research on the topic suggests that rank-and- yank systems result in increased levels of organizational productivity, especially during the first few years in which the system is in place (Scullen, Bergey, & Aiman-Smith, ). Employees, however, consider forced distribution scales to be the least fair method of performance appraisal (Roch, Sternburgh, & Caputo, ).

Forced distribution systems are much easier to use than the other two employee comparison methods, but they also have a drawback. To use the method, one must assume that employee performance is normally distributed, that is, that there are certain percentages of employees who are poor, average, and excellent. As will be discussed in more detail in Chapter , employee performance probably is not normally distributed because of restriction of range. There probably are few terrible employees because they either were never hired or were quickly fired.
