## elements in determining commensurate rates are:

Determining the standard for workers who do not have disabilities - the objective gauge against which the productivity of the worker with a disability is measured

Determining the prevailing wage - the wage paid to experienced workers who do not have disabilities for

the same or similar work and who are performing such work in the area. Most SCA contracts include a

wage determination specifying the prevailing wage rates to be paid for work on the SCA contract

Evaluating the quantity and quality of the productivity of the worker with the disability

All commensurate wage rates must be reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at periodic intervals. At a

minimum, the productivity of hourly paid workers must be reevaluated every six months and a new prevailing

wage survey must be conducted at least every twelve months.

Any employee paid a subminimum wage (or his or her parent or guardian) may petition the Secretary of Labor,

under FLSA Section 14(c)(5), to have the commensurate wage rate reviewed to determine if the wage is

justiﬁed. The review will be conducted by a U.S. Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge. Such

petitions are completely independent of any enforcement action that may be undertaken by the Wage and

Hour Division. Although the petition does not have to follow a particular format or form, it must be signed by the individual (or his or her parent or guardian) and should contain the name and address of the individual

ﬁling the petition and the name and address of his or her employer

. The Wage and Hour Division's role in the petition process is solely to serve as a conduit—the means through

which the petition is forwarded to the Oﬃce of the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The Wage and Hour

Division does not serve as a party in this matter. It does not represent either the employee with a disability or his or her employer. In all matters relating to the propriety of a commensurate wage rate, the burden of proof

rests with the employer. See 29 CFR Part 525.22 for more information.
