## HBR / Digital Article / Office Politics Don’t Have to Be Toxic

their peers “played the game” that was “all about trying to get the other

person down.”

In response to these toxic cultures, many of the people we talked to

disengaged from politics, keeping their heads down and redoubling their work eﬀorts rather than joining the political melee. For example,

one interviewee told us that participating in their workplace’s oﬃce

politics meant “you’re willing to bend the rules and you’re willing to

bully, you’re willing to step on people, and morally, to me, I don’t

agree with that, so I would not be part of that social club, so I haven’t

[progressed].” Another explained, “I didn’t get involved in the politics;

just did a good job and that was it.” Some even sought to leave their jobs

entirely: “I wasn’t conﬁdent I would succeed because of the cliquiness of

the organization,” a participant shared, “so I looked for jobs elsewhere.”

These reactions are understandable — but the problem with avoiding

the political arena is that it can lead employees to miss out on the vital

development opportunities and relationships they need to get things

done and advance their careers.
