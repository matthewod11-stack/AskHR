about employee loyalty that can benefit organizations, managers, and employees directly. For

example, when employees intend to stay with a company, they often demonstrate high

going beyond whether employees have shown loyalty behaviors and considering their

willingness to recommend the company as a great workplace. Employees with a high eNPS score

are highly engaged and satisfied with their workplace, while employees with a low score have

room for improvement (Legerstee, 2013; Lynch, 2022; Meschke, 2021). Companies can use

eNPS data to identify areas for improvement, increase employee retention, and attract top talent.
