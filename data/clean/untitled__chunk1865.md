## Nervous Diseases—Neurosis and Neurasthenia

The debate about neurological disorders underlying nervous diseases, in particular hysteria and hypochondria, continued well into the late nineteenth century. One important event in the debate was the introduction of the concept of neurasthe- nia (literally weakness of the nerves) by George Beard (1880). The term had already found it way into medical lit- erature (e.g., Kraus, 1831). Charcot’s 1888–1889 modiﬁca- tion (as cited in Lópes-Piñero, 1983) mentioned two major neuroses, hysteria and neurasthenia. Both terms passed into the twentieth century, each carrying the implication of a sep- arate hereditary biological basis. Many psychopathologists claimed a gender difference in these two disorders, hysteria being a female neurosis and neurasthenia a male neurosis.
