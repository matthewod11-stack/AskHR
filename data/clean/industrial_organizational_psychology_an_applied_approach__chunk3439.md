# Empowerment Charts

Organizations never have just one level of employee input and control that applies to every employee. Instead, levels will differ by employee as well as by task. For example, a bank teller might be placed at the absolute level to decide when she will take her breaks, at the advisory level when it comes to hiring new employees, and at the following level when it comes to waiving check fees. To reduce confu- sion, it is a good idea for organizations to develop what I call individual employee empowerment charts. An example of such a chart is shown in Figure ..

In the chart, notice that for each task, a range of control/input is allowed. For example, the task of opening new accounts can be performed at the

following, ownership, or advisory level. Our new employee, Jane (J), is at the following level, whereas our experienced teller, Emily (E), is at the advisory level. In most organizations, a new employee would most likely be placed at the following level until she has demonstrated mastery in performing the task. Individual employee empowerment charts reduce confusion and provide a sys- tematic plan for providing employees with more autonomy as their skills and experience increase.
