## What Makes Someone Choose to Become an Ally?

Those who choose to become allies have many characteristics in common; identify- ing these common characteristics may be helpful for organizations in targeting an audience for allyship development programs. However, it should first be noted that much of this depends on what community the person wants to be an ally for. For instance, women are more likely than men to become allies to the LGBTQ commu- nity (Fingerhut, 2011), but this finding does not make sense in the context of ally- ship and gender (i.e., women would not be thought of as allies for gender equality as they are considered the minority group in this context). Overall, though, there are some characteristics that have been identified as somewhat common across all types of allyship.
