## HBR / The Big Idea / Everyone Deserves a Season to Step Back

a promotion, moving to a role with less travel and more-predictable

hours, or trimming back a workload to allow for ﬂexibility or shorter

days. What’s true in all cases is this: It is time-limited; codesigned

by the employee, their team and manager, and HR; has no negative ramiﬁcations for the person stepping back; and oﬀers a seamless

breast cancer (some identifying details have been changed). She

contacted the head of human resources at the venture-backed company

where she worked to discuss accommodations. She didn’t want to

follow the typical solution in the United States of going on short-term

disability leave. Melissa was clear that she didn’t want to stop working.

She liked having something to think about other than her treatment; it oﬀered some normalcy during a tumultuous period. So, she and HR

crafted a set of parameters: She needed to start late on Mondays, end early on Fridays, and be oﬀ camera for meetings for a few months. While

she was undergoing chemotherapy infusions, she would be available

over email and on Slack but would decline or reschedule meetings.

The approach worked well. Melissa was able to take care of her health

on her own terms and ramp back up at work when she was ready.

Equally valuable, the company retained an ambitious, high-performing

employee who had deep institutional knowledge and an even stronger
