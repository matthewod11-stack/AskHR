Although researchers have not agreed on the exact reason for these find- ings, four explanations have each received some empirical support. The first explanation holds that the mere presence of others naturally produces arousal (Zajonc, ). This arousal, or increase in energy, helps an individual perform well-learned tasks but hinders him in performing poorly learned or unpracticed tasks.

The second explanation states that a coacting audience provides a means for comparison. If an individual is working on a task with another individual, he can directly compare his performance with the other person’s. In some jobs, this comparison effect may increase competition and production quantity, whereas in other jobs, comparison effects may cause employees to slow down to be in line with the working norm.

The third explanation—evaluation apprehension—hypothesizes that judg- ment by others causes the differential effects of social facilitation (Cottrell, ). That is, individuals are aware that the presence of others can be rewarding (e.g., when a crowd cheers) or punishing (when a crowd boos). On well-learned tasks, the individual knows that he normally performs well and thus expects a rewarding experience when in the presence of others. When the task is not well learned, however, the individual may believe that she will not perform well and will be embarrassed; thus she performs even worse than if she were alone.

One example of this phenomenon was seen in an experiment by Michaels, Blommel, Brocato, Linkous, and Rowe (), who observed students shooting pool and found that good players increased their shot accuracy from % to % when watched by an audience, whereas poor players’ accuracy decreased from % to % when they were watched (Table .). Thombs, Beck, and Mahoney () found that high-intensity drinkers were more likely than low-intensity drinkers to drink in social situations.

The evaluation-apprehension explanation has special application to indus- try and training settings. Imagine a waiter who must carry five plates of food to a table. For a new waiter, this is not a well-learned task, and in the presence of others he is likely to be anxious. When the lack of practice in carrying plates is combined with a large restaurant crowd, the chance of an accident increases. So what is the solution? The waiter should practice carrying several plates before the restaurant opens. Evaluation apprehension also occurs when performance is being monitored electronically rather than in person (Davidson & Henderson, ). Thus, supervisors who remotely monitor employee performance over a computer must be aware of the potential effects on performance.

The fourth explanation proposes that the presence of others is distracting to the individual who is trying to perform a task (Sanders, ). On well-learned tasks, the individual is able to perform despite the distraction because the behav- iors are almost automatic. On a novel or complicated task, however, the distrac- tion caused by other people’s presence keeps the individual from concentrating and learning the task. For example, Baxter, Manstead, Stradling, and Campbell () found that drivers with passengers were less likely to signal than were drivers without anyone else in the car and a meta-analysis by Caird, Willness, Steel, and Scialfa () found that drivers using cell phones had slower reaction times than drivers not using cell phones while driving.

An example that demonstrates the effects emphasized by both the evaluation- apprehension and distraction theories is that of coaching children in sports. In a typical Little League practice, one coach must teach an eight-year-old how to bat while ten other children stand in the field and wait for a ball to be hit to them.

Each time the child at the plate fails to hit the ball, the others tease him. After a while, the children in the field are bored and begin to throw rocks and talk with one another. What is the probability of success in teaching this child to hit under these circumstances? For the coach to be successful, he must teach the child alone and away from other children.

Effects of social facilitation also have been examined in sports by investigating the advantage that a team might have by playing its game at home. In general, hav- ing a home crowd behind a team or an individual athlete such as a wrestler increases the probability of winning (Carron, Loughhead, & Bray, ; McAndrew, ).

Social Loafing. Whereas the social facilitation versus social inhibition theory explains increases and decreases in performance when others are present and either watching the individual or working with her, the social loafing theory con- siders the effect on individual performance when people work together on a task. Social loafing was first investigated by Ringleman (reported in Moede, ) in a study in which subjects singly pulled as hard as possible on a rope while he measured their exerted force. Ringleman then had his subjects perform the task in pairs. He expected the force exerted by two subjects to be approximately twice that exerted by a single subject, but to his surprise he found that both subjects exerted less force than when they worked alone.

More recent research has supported the theory and has found that social loafing occurs with many tasks. For example, Parrett () found that restau- rant customers left a higher tip percentage when they dined alone than when they dined with others. This explains why tips, or gratuities, often are automati- cally added to a bill when six or more people dine at a table.

Although it is clear that social loafing occurs, especially in poor performers (Hardy & Crace, ), it is not clear why it occurs. One theory is that because group members realize that their individual efforts will not be noticed, there is little chance of individual reward. A second theory, called the free-rider theory (Kerr & Bruun, ), postulates that when things are going well, a group mem- ber realizes that his effort is not necessary and thus does not work as hard as he would if he were alone. If this explanation is true, social loafing should occur only when a group project is going well.

The third theory, called the sucker effect (Kerr, ), hypothesizes that social loafing occurs when a group member notices that other group members are not working hard and thus are “playing him for a sucker.” To avoid this situation, the individual lowers his work performance to match those of the other members. This theory, however, does not explain the loafing of other members.

Social loafing is an important variable to keep in mind; having employees work together on a project may not be as productive as having them work indi- vidually. Fortunately, social loafing can be reduced by evaluating employees on their individual contributions to the group (Karau & Williams, ), explaining the link between individual effort and group performance (Shepperd & Taylor, ), and rewarding those who achieve (George, ; Shepperd, ). Punish- ing social loafers has unpredictable effects—sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t (George, ; Miles & Greenberg, ).
