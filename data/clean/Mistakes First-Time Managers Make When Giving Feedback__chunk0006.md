The first thing you should do as a new manager is to get to knoweach of your team members —including their career aspirationsand goals. In your on-one-one conversations, you can ask: “Whatgoals are your hoping to achieve in your role over the next sixmonths?” or “How do you see your role evolving over the nextyear?” Some of your direct reports may be focused on gettingpromoted, while others may be eager to develop skills that willhelp them take on higher-profile assignments.Once context has been established, and you’re clear about howyou can support your team members’ development, you can beginto link your feedback to their goals. For example, you might say, “Iknow you want to take on more responsibility, so this is an area inwhich you need more development. One thing you can do betteris …” In those two sentences you go from critic to coach. Showingyour direct reports that you care about their growth through yourfeedback will further help instill their trust in you.

Given the

discomfort of sharing feedback with others, it’s notsurprising that your first instinct may be to

avoid it. When you seean opportunity for giving negative feedback, for example, youmay find yourself simply hoping the issue will resolve on its own.Or you may assume it will be easier to wait and deliver yourfeedback during a structured annual review.But delaying feedback, or simply waiting for a situation toimprove, helps no one. By avoiding these conversations, you’redoing a disservice to your direct reports and the overall success ofyour team.
