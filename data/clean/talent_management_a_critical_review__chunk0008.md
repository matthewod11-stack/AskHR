In this paper we review the practitioner- oriented publications that host most of the discussions regarding TM and identify several problems with the way TM is defined, operationalized, and supported. We then draw from the peer-reviewed strategic human resource management (HRM) literature to determine implications for TM. Next, we identify several lines of research and theory that may serve as the basis of a rigorous, scientifically based approach to TM.
