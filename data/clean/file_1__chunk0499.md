# THEORY AND HYPOTHESES

Social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) explains how individuals evaluate their own opinions and outcomes by comparing themselves with others. Individuals look to the images described by others and subsequently make comparisons among themselves, others, and idealized images. The theory proposes that women have a tendency to use different pay comparisons than men so that female employees are likely to compare their rewards with the rewards of other female employees who have similar education, tenure, and other factors rather than with those of males. Since women tend to be paid less than men, they are likely to base their outcome explanations on, and evaluate the fairness of their outcomes against a lower social comparison standard than do men (Major and Konar, 1984).

Differences in pay expectations may also determine why gender plays a crucial role in reactions to pay inequity. According to social comparison theory, individuals with similar attributes and opinions are relevant to each other and are, thus, influential to each other (Suls, Martin and Wheeler, 2002). This may mean that those individuals who have low pay expectations are expected to compare themselves with those individuals who have similar pay expectations (Jackson and Grabski, 1988). In a similar manner, employees with low pay expectations tend to build their pay
