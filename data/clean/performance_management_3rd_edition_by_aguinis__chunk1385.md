possible?” and “What were the conditions that made this success story possi- ble?” It is important to uncover both the personal and contextual factors that led to the success story. This step is similar to conducting detective work to try to understand the various factors that led to success, including the role that the work environment (e.g., technology) and others (e.g., customers, peers) played in the story.

- 3. Extrapolating the past into the future. The third step involves asking questions that will lead to an employee’s ability to replicate the conditions that led to success in the past into the future. So, the supervisor can first note that “The conditions you have just described seem to be your personal code for reaching [insert the key achievement in the story such as happiness at work, optimal performance, and outstanding leadership].” Then, follow up with questions such as, “Think about your current actions, priorities, and plans for the near future (e.g., next week, month, or quarter), and tell me how you think you may be able to replicate these conditions to be able to achieve the same level of [insert satisfaction, achievement, performance, etc.] as you did before.”

Results of the FFI may suggest that there may be resources that the employee needs to achieve his or her developmental goals. Thus, as a second step in terms of a supervisor’s role, he or she has a primary role in referring the employee to appropri- ate developmental activities that can assist the employee in achieving her goals. This includes helping the employee select a mentor, appropriate reading resources, courses, and so forth. Third, the supervisor reviews and makes suggestions about the developmental objectives. Specifically, the supervisor helps assure the goals are achievable, specific, and doable. Fourth, the supervisor has primary responsibility for checking on the employee’s progress toward achieving the developmental goals. For example, the supervisor can remind the employee of due dates and revise goals if needed. Finally, the supervisor needs to provide reinforcements so the employee will be motivated to achieve the developmental goals. Reinforcements can be extrinsic and include rewards such as bonuses and additional benefits, but reinforcements can also include the assignment of more challenging and interesting work that takes advantage of the new skills learned.

Supervisors themselves need to be motivated to perform functions that will support the employees’ completion of their developmental objectives, including conducting FFIs. For this to happen, supervisors must be rewarded for doing a good job in helping their employees develop. Consider how this is done at KLA-Tencor Corporation (www.kla-tencor.com), one of the world’s top 10 manufacturers of semi- conductor equipment. At KLA-Tencor, between 10 and 30% of supervisors’ bonus pay is directly tied to employee development. Employee development is measured in terms of employee training and certification levels. Managers are given at least quarterly updates on the status of their staff development. In addition, employees themselves are rewarded for engaging in developmental activities. In fact, only employees with up-to-date training and certification levels are eligible for bonuses. Thus, employee development is successful at KLA-Tencor because both employees and managers are directly rewarded for employee development. After several years of implementing
