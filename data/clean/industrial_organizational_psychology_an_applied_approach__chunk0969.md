Manpower Incorporated, in Chandler, Arizona, the Chicago Police Department, and the Hackensack, New Jersey, Police Department, formed partnerships with local churches that resulted in successful hires (Tyler, ). Xerox, J. P. Morgan, and American Express developed recruitment strategies and such gay-friendly benefits as domestic partner benefits to recruit and retain gay and lesbian employees (Armour, ). Seventy percent of organizations have reported that hiring welfare recipients has been a successful source of recruitment (Minton-Eversole, ). Due to low wage-and-benefit costs, Jostens Incorporated and Escod Industries are using prison inmates to perform work.

Denny’s and Sheboygan Upholstery have been successful in recruiting ex-cons. In fact, the Kettle Moraine Correctional Institution in Wisconsin held a job fair for  soon-to-be-released convicts.
