## Developing New Research on Humor and Culture in Organizations

Numerous other dimensions of culture have been proposed (see the Chinese Cultural Connection, 1987 and Schwartz, 1994), and are undoubt- edly useful in various contexts. However, we evaluate only one additional dimension, known as cultural tightness (Pelto, 1968), which we believe might be particularly relevant to the examination of humor. In the sections below, we describe the three dimensions of individualismâ€“collectivism, power distance, and tightness in more detail, and note why each dimension has particular relevance for understanding humor use in organizations.
