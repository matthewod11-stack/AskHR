## understanding of the change in employee experience over time. We

also augmented our data with datasets from layoﬀs.fyi. Here’s what we

learned:

After layoffs, companies see a signiﬁcant drop in employee experience in many key areas.

We found that company conﬁdence dropped 16.9 percentage points.

Belief in career opportunities dropped 12.1 percentage points. And

conﬁdence in leadership dropped 10.5 percentage points.

We conducted further research this year, looking at the experiences

of companies that conducted layoﬀs in 2023 to see if these patterns

were consistent with previous ﬁndings, and we found that layoﬀs are

having an even bigger impact on employee engagement. On average,

engagement declined 2 percentage points more than in the 2020–2022
