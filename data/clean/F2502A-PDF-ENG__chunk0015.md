“What employees do with the extra time ultimately depends on how

managers encourage them to use it,” Engeler says. “Employees could

plan to use it for stretching, getting a coﬀee, interacting with colleagues,

or working on a strategic project. Whatever it is, it’s important to

allocate this time purposefully in advance. Without guidance and

preplanned activities, the saved time might easily slip away unused.”

Monitor how the time is redirected. Regular monitoring and feedback

are crucial to help employees make the most of their newfound time.

Managers should stay engaged, observing what their reports do with

time windfalls and promoting eﬀective uses.
