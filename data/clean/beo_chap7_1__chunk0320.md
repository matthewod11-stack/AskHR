From the deviations perspective on “individual behavioral concepts” this blunt sum-

mary is correct. Yet to an organizational theorist it looks odd, since the evolutionary

economics community has produced hundreds of papers about firms stemming from

the treatment of routine in Nelson and Winter (1982). Moreover, the performance

properties of routine action have been linked to “how the brain works” (Cohen and

Bacdayan 1994)-—in this case to the distinction between procedural and declarative

memory (Squire and Kandel 1999). This stark difference suggests that the visibility

of research on routine action in organizations, and of many other important aspects

of the day-to-day performance of firms, will depend crucially on which of the two

contending perspectives future economic researchers have in mind.
