## Mediating Mechanisms: Trust in the Leader and LMX Quality

Trust in the leader and LMX quality represent competing SET based variables that

can explain the link between leadership styles and follower outcomes. While LMX is one of

the most frequent operationalisations of SET, trust and particularly affective trust is among

the most content valid (Colquitt et al., 2014). Overall, the results of our mediation analysis

provided two key findings. Firstly, LMX quality and trust in the leader were distinct

mediators each demonstrating significant indirect effects between leadership and both

performance and OCB. The exception to this overall pattern relates to paternalistic

leadership. Specifically, we found that trust did not mediate the relationship between any of

the dimensions of paternalistic leadership and OCB, while LMX did not mediate the

authoritarian dimension of paternalistic leadership. Taken together these findings highlight

that LMX and trust in the leader provide distinctive exploratory pathways for both other-rated
