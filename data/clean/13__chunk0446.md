It is my belief that this task of performance vectoring presents a new but valuable approach to the applied prediction problem, and a new way to build a connection between research and practice. Fundamentally, the task is that of predicting performance over time; yet, the requirements of the task reveal how all realms of human resource research related to the prediction of job performance need to be combined to provide any hope of being able to make this task feasible. With performance vectoring being just introduced,
