# DISCUSSION

Previous studies on organizational justice have come to somewhat inconsistent conclusions regarding gender differences in the effect of equity (e.g., Graham and Welbourne, 1999) and organizational justice (e.g., Lee and Farh, 1999; Major and Adams, 1983; Major and Deaux, 1982; Sweeney and McFarlin, 1997) on organizational commitment. Gender literature has long been puzzled with the question of why even though female employees tend to earn less than their comparable male counterparts, they continue to be committed to their organizations to the same or even higher extent than their male colleagues (Clark, 1997; Crosby, 1982; Jackson and Grabski, 1988). We contribute to these debates by integrating social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) and the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999) into analysis of gender differences in reactions to organizational injustice. Aligned with the hypotheses, our empirical analysis of personnel at two Finnish universities reveals that gender differences in responses to injustice are such that men’s organizational commitment is more strongly affected by pay inequity than women’s, whereas women’s organizational commitment is affected more strongly by perceptions of procedural justice than men’s. Gender difference in responses to inequity is in part explained by pay comparison and access to pay.
