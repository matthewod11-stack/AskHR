McGinest, a great linebacker during my early years with the Patriots,

was six-foot-ﬁve and 270 pounds. He used his physical presence and

voice as a leadership tool. When Willie said something, people stood

up straight and said: “Yes, Willie, we’ll do whatever you ask us to do.”

Matthew Slater, who I played with in the 2010s, became a leader by

example because of how hard he played on our special teams unit. The

dedication and work he put into his job endeared him to his teammates.

Assistant coaches played important leadership roles, too. Dante

Scarnecchia, who coached our oﬀensive line, combined the tough

discipline that Belichick exuded with a deep personal caring for people.

He got every ounce of eﬀort out of his players, every day. At the

Patriots we talked about leaders as “culture drivers,” and in any given

season there were probably a dozen players who held that role, each

complementing the others with his own style.

people to focus on themselves instead of the team. In professional

sports, agents can be one example. In a perfect world, I’d have three

great receivers who didn’t care which one I threw the ball to, as long as

we won the game. In reality, if receiver A has a great day, receivers B

and C may be happy we won, but then they may hear rumblings about
