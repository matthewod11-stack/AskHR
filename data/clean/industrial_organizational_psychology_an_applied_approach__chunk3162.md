# Chapter Summary

In this chapter you learned: 7

Groups consist of multiple members who perceive themselves as a unit and share a common goal or goals. People join groups due to a need for affiliation, a need to identify with success, a need for emotional support, a need for assistance, common goals, physical proximity, and assignment. Factors that influence a group’s success include its level of cohesiveness, the composition and stability of its membership, and the group’s size, status, and communication structure. Teams go through four developmental stages: forming, storming, norming, and performing. The team approach is not always the best. Conflict usually results from factors such as competition for resources, task interdependence, jurisdictional ambiguity, communication barriers, and personality. People react to conflict by ignoring it through withdrawal, trying to win at all costs, trying to persuade the other side to resolve the conflict in their favor, bargaining for an agreement, or asking for third-party help.
