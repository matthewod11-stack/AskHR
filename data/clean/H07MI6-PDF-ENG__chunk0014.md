# transformations).

Transformations are extremely diﬃcult on a personal level for everyone

involved. In the successes we studied, leaders not only made sure their

teams had the processes, resources, and technology they needed —

they also built the right emotional conditions. These leaders oﬀered

a compelling rationale driving the transformation, and they ensured

employees had the emotional support they needed to execute. This

meant that when the going inevitably got tough, employees felt

appropriately challenged and ultimately energized by the stress.

By contrast, leaders of the unsuccessful transformations didn’t make

the same emotional investment. When their teams hit the inevitable

challenges, negative emotions spiked, and the team entered a

downward spiral. Leaders lost faith and looked to distance themselves

from the project, which led employees to do the same.
