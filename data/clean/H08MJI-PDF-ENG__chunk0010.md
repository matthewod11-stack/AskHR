## HBR / Digital Article / How to Get Better at Delegating

Determine tasks you can delegate (hint: there are a lot)

According to Kerpen, there are only three things a manager can’t

delegate: strategy and vision—which he calls, “the head work, that’s

why you’re the leader”; hiring decisions; and ensuring access to

resources and budget to get the job done. Everything else? Let it go.

When a task lands on your plate, ask yourself: Can someone else handle

this? If it doesn’t fall into those three categories, the answer is probably “yes.” While it’s easier to delegate tasks you dislike, it’s more diﬃcult to hand oﬀ the ones you’re good at and enjoy, says Morgan. “They’re

the hardest things to let go of because they consume a lot of your time

and make you feel important and needed.” But hoarding these tasks

deprives your team members of learning opportunities, she says. “Think

of delegation as a way for them to grow their skill sets.”
