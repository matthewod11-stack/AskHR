# Example Interaction:

[Raw response from Car Manual Agent before rephrasing]: "In the event of a tire

pressure monitoring system alert, the vehicle has detected that one or more tires have

fallen below the recommended inflation pressure of 2.2 bar. The affected tire's pressure is

approximately 1.8 bar, which is 18.75% below recommended levels. This does not constitute

an immediate safety hazard, but prolonged driving with underinflated tires can lead to

decreased fuel efficiency, reduced tire longevity, and potentially compromised handling

characteristics. It is advisable to proceed to a service station at your earliest convenience

to reinflate the tire to proper specifications."

Rephraser Agent: [Adapts for driving context, adjusts information density and urgency]

Final Response to User: "Your front right tire is a bit low - down to 1.8 bar. It's safe to

keep driving, but you'll want to add some air at the next petrol station. Low tire pressure

can affect your fuel economy and make the tire wear out faster. I can help you find a

nearby place to fill up if you'd like."
