Ariely et al. (2004b) use a simple experimental paradigm to calibrate psychic

income for what they call the “meaning” of work. Students proofread pages for a

declining wage schedule (the wage for the marginal page fell) and handed finished

pages to an experimenter. When their work was “ignored” (simply placed on a stack)

or immediately shredded, they finished only about six pages, compared with nine

pages when their pages were signed and filed away. Thus, the subjects traded off

marginal wages for “meaningful” work which was kept rather than shredded.

In discussing our paper at the conference, Holmstrom suggested that what work-

ers fundamentally care about is that their efforts are appreciated. For example,

7Qne form of benchmarking is a tournament structure, which seems to account for some features of

internal labor markets with clear career paths (see, for example, Main et al. 1993).
