# Management Grid:

The programme consists of six phases and lasts between three and five years. It starts with improving managerial abilities, moves on to improving group dynamics and intergroup relations, enters the corporate planning stage, creates an execution strategy, and concludes with an evaluation phase. Numerous potential leadership philosophies are represented by the grid. Concern for people and concern for production are the two fundamental orientations that each style embodies in a unique way.

Conferences: A conference is a gathering of regular people to talk about a topic of interest. Each member's participation is shown in this instance when they build on one another's ideas. This approach works best when a problem needs to be analysed and looked at from various angles. Through this strategy, people can learn, broaden their knowledge, and develop their ability to engage. Everyone is free to express their opinions and thoughts through this approach.

Lectures: The simplest way to convey knowledge is reportedly through lectures. These typically occur in a setting that mimics a classroom. In front of the learners, the instructors speak verbally. Most of the time, they do this by using technology. In the form of Power Point presentations, the principles are presented. Utilising books, documents, and articles is another option. In this approach, the students are asked to take notes while listening to the instructor explain numerous concepts and tactics. Some subjects are just briefly described, so the trainees can improve their grasp by using the internet, books, and other sources. It is a straightforward approach that works for a bigger group of people. The majority of the time, trainees who receive instruction through lecture methods pay close enough attention to what the instructor is saying. There isn't much room for engagement with this approach.
