and can increase pressure even if the quantity of work is not excessive. Additionally, the expectations and standards set by employers or colleagues can affect perceived pressure. Unrealistic expectations or a culture that prioritizes constant overachievement can lead to heightened pressure levels. Furthermore, external factors, such as tight deadlines, resource constraints, and unexpected challenges, can intensify both workload and pressure. These external pressures can be particularly challenging to manage because they are often beyond an individual's control.

Effective time management and problem-solving skills become crucial in these situations to mitigate the impact of external pressures.Individual differences also play a significant role in how people perceive and cope with workload and pressure. Some individuals thrive in high- pressure environments and are motivated by challenging tasks, while others may find such conditions overwhelming. Personal resilience, coping strategies, and stress management skills play a vital role in determining how well individuals handle these demands. Organizational factors, such as company culture, leadership, and support systems, also influence the interplay between workload and pressure. A supportive and empathetic work culture can help employees manage and reduce pressure, while a toxic or unsupportive environment can exacerbate stress levels. Effective leadership can play a crucial role in setting realistic expectations, providing resources, and promoting work-life balance, all of which can alleviate pressure and create a healthier workload[7], [8].

- 2. Interpersonal Conflicts

Interpersonal conflicts with colleagues, supervisors, or clients can create a hostile work environment and contribute to elevated stress levels. Disagreements, misunderstandings, or a lack of communication can all contribute to tension in the workplace.Interpersonal conflicts are a natural and common part of human interaction, occurring when individuals have differing opinions, needs, or interests that lead to tension and discord in their relationships. These conflicts can manifest in various settings, such as personal relationships, workplaces, or social groups, and they can arise from a multitude of factors, including miscommunication, differing values, competing goals, or even personal insecurities. Understanding the dynamics of interpersonal conflicts, their causes, consequences, and effective resolution strategies, is crucial for maintaining healthy and functional relationships.

One key aspect of interpersonal conflicts is their multifaceted nature. Conflicts can occur on a range of levels, from minor disagreements to more serious and deeply rooted issues. These conflicts can be categorized into different types, such as interpersonal, intrapersonal, or intergroup conflicts, each presenting its unique challenges. Interpersonal conflicts, in particular, arise when individuals clash over various matters, including personal preferences, opinions, values, or behaviors. These conflicts may involve differences in communication styles, expectations, or even unresolved past issues that resurface during the course of the relationship. Consequently, understanding the root causes and dynamics of interpersonal conflicts is essential for managing and resolving them effectively. Miscommunication is often a significant factor contributing to interpersonal conflicts. People have diverse communication styles, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of messages.

Some individuals may be more direct in their communication, while others may use indirect or passive-aggressive approaches. These differences can create confusion and frustration, as one person's intention may not align with how their message is perceived by the other party.
