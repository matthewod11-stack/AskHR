# 3.3 Common Method Variance

This study used self-reporting measures for the measurement of managerial coaching and thriving at work; a common method variance may occur in this study. Podsakoff et al (2003) describe the method for diagnosing the common method bias, which is Harman’s single factor test. In accordance to, Mattila and Enz, (2002), as stated in Harmans’s test, “if a single factor emerges from the exploratory factor analysis or one factor accounts for more than 50% of the variance in the items, methods bias is present”. In our study, single- factor showed only 24% of the total variance which revealed that there is no common method bias.
