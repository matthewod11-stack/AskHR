expertise to solve the problem itself. As an example, universities typically form committees whose membership consists of representatives from various colleges (e.g., arts and sciences, education) and departments (e.g., history, psychology, economics). Such a membership strategy makes sense if the issue is one on which various departments might differ. That is, a committee asked to determine general education requirements or summer school offerings should have representatives from each department. However, a committee formed to develop fund-raising strategies would be better served with a membership of marketing and psychol- ogy faculty rather than history and music faculty.

Research on the personal characteristics of team members has revealed some interesting findings. Teams whose members are bright, conscientious, extra- verted, and emotionally stable perform better than teams whose members do not possess such characteristics (Barrick, Stewart, Neubert, & Mount, ; Devine & Phillips, ).

Distrust of the Team Process Many teams don’t succeed because management doesn’t trust the concept of teams. A study by the consulting firm Zinger Miller found that in organizations in which top management was not enthusiastic about the team approach, only % of teams made satisfactory progress. However, in teams with supportive manage- ment, % made satisfactory progress (Moran et al., ). Some of this distrust comes from managers being unwilling to give up any authority. Managers, too, need to be trained in the team process if the team concept is going to survive.

Team members must also be receptive to the team process. Research indicates that job satisfaction and organizational commitment are reduced when members are not receptive to the team process (Kirkman & Shapiro, ). Another source of team distrust is that not all work is appropriate for teams (Drexler & Forrester, ). That is, some tasks (e.g., typing) are better done individually, and others, such as kissing, are performed better with the help of others.

Unclear Objectives Teams work best when they know why they were formed, what they are expected to accomplish (what the team’s “charge” is), and when they are supposed to be finished. Though this would all seem obvious, you would be surprised at how many teams aren’t sure what they are supposed to do. As an example, I was on a university committee entitled “Committee on Student Evaluation of Faculty.” We spent most of the time during our first few meetings asking, “What are we supposed to do?” “Are we supposed to design a new evaluation instrument?” and “Do we make decisions or do we just make recommendations?” It took almost a month to get clarification, and during that time the committee made no progress, its members became frustrated, and attendance dropped.
