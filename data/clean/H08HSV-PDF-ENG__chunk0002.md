No one would argue that having high standards for your work and your

teams is a bad thing. Yet sometimes, extraordinarily high standards can

be unproductive and halt forward movement in your leadership career.

Leadership can be messy. Things often don’t go as planned. Rather

than accepting this as a natural part of life, if your standards are too

inﬂexible, you’ll feel perpetually frustrated because neither you nor

your team live up to your goals.
