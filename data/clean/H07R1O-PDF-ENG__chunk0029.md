# Listen to Professional Advisors.

Particularly when facing a crisis, companies often hire teams of

external advisors and PR consultants. These people bring the beneﬁt

of experience: they understand the arc of a crisis, have seen

which approaches tend to work (and don’t), and often have trusted

relationships with media organizations. This makes them potential

sources of tremendous value, and CEOs should listen to them. At the

same time, CEOs should focus on the root of the word advisor, which

is “advise.” CEOs should be careful not to outsource or delegate in a

way that causes them to lose control or become distanced from the

controversy or challenge. In situations requiring emotional labor, CEOs

should hire and listen to the best advisors they can ﬁnd—but they must

remain in control and make critical decisions.
