Now sketch out your own 2×2; we call it the Strategic Life Portfolio. But

instead of mapping growth against share, you will put the importance

of each SLU on the y-axis and the satisfaction it brings on the x-axis.

Plot each SLU with a bubble, making the size of the bubble roughly

proportional to the percentage of time in a week you spend on it.

In the top-left quadrant, you will ﬁnd the SLUs of high importance

and low satisfaction. These are areas of high urgency, because you care

about these activities deeply but aren’t focusing on them enough to get

the most out of them. The SLUs in the top-right quadrant also deserve

some attention: You want to keep devoting signiﬁcant time and energy
