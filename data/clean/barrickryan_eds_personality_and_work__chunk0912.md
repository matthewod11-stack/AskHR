# 330 PERSONALITY AND WORK

has moderately large ((cid:1) = .50) and generalizable validity (Frei & McDaniel, 1998).

Taken together, this research illustrates there may be a func- tional personality at work. Those who are planful, dependable, and achievement oriented (Conscientious), as well as calm, not de- pressed, and conﬁdent (Emotional Stability), and those who are kind, courteous, and trusting (Agreeable) are likely to be better performers. And again, it may well be that these validities are pri- marily due to the underlying relationship with the common, over- all performance component rather than speciﬁc performance facets.

One other example of the type of question that may focus on a higher-order structure than the Big Five has to do with the rela- tionship between two major individual difference paradigms: per- sonality traits and vocational interests. Prior research has shown that the RIASEC vocational interest types (Holland, 1985) can be explained by higher-order factors, similar to Factors Beta and Alpha found in the Big Five. For example, Hogan (Hogan, 1983; Hogan & Blake, 1999) argues the RIASEC vocational interest types consist of two higher-order dimensions, which he labels Confor- mity and Sociability. In many respects, the deﬁnitions of these two dimensions correspond closely with those provided previously for Factors Alpha and Beta. Consequently, analyses of vocational in- terests and personality traits at the higher-order level may show that the personality factors of Alpha and Beta have counterparts in vo- cational interest. Thus, when the construct that personality is being compared to is broadly deﬁned, as are interests in the RIASEC model, the personality constructs need to be equally broad to en- hance understanding. In the case of understanding structural re- lations between personality and vocational interests, it may be best to use a higher-order model of personality than the Big Five.

Conversely, as a number of chapters emphasize (Saucier and Goldberg in Chapter One, Johnson in Chapter Four, and Hough in Chapter Eleven), it is likely to be appropriate and even neces- sary to use a lower-level model of personality than the Big Five when the goal is to enhance understanding about the relationship between personality and speciﬁc performance facets rather than to predict overall performance. That is, to examine how personal- ity relates to speciﬁc performance components, there is likely to
