# The Cognitive-Contents Approach

In the cognitive-contents approach, one seeks to compare the performances of experts and novices in complex tasks such as physics problems (e.g., Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981; Chi, Glaser, & Rees, 1982; Larkin, McDermott, Simon, & Simon, 1980), the selection of moves and strategies in chess and other games (Chase & Simon, 1973; DeGroot, 1965; Reitman, 1976), and the acquisition of domain-related information by groups of people at different levels of expertise (Chiesi, Spilich, & Voss, 1979). The notion underlying such research can be seen as abilities being forms of developing expertise (R. J.Sternberg,1998).Inotherwords,theexpertshavedevel- oped high levels of intellectual abilities in particular domains as results of the development of their expertise.
