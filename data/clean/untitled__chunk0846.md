# The Cognitive-Training Approach

The goal of the cognitive-training approach is to infer the components of information processing from how individuals perform when they are trained. According to Campione, Brown, and Ferrara (1982), one starts with a theoretical analysis of a task and a hypothesis about a source of individ- ual differences within that task. It might be assumed, for ex- ample, that components A, B, and C are required to carry out Task X and that less able children do poorly because of a weakness in component A. To test this assertion, one might train less able participants in the use of Aand then retest them on X. If performance improves, the task analysis is sup- ported. If performance does not improve, then either A was not an important component of the task, participants were originally efﬁcient with regard to A and did not need train- ing, or the training was ineffective (see also Belmont & Butterﬁeld, 1971; Belmont, Butterﬁeld, & Ferretti, 1982; Borkowski & Wanschura, 1974).
