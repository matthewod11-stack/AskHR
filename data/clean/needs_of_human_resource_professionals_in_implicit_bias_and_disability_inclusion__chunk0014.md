# Abstract

BACKGROUND: Research investigating the implicit bias of employers towards individuals with disabilities emphasizes the importance of increased attention to implicit bias in the workplace. Previous research supports the use of trainings to promote awareness and education of implicit and explicit bias toward people with disabilities among employers.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to better understand employersâ€™ stigmatizing attitudes toward individuals with disabilities and develop effective strategies to increase awareness and knowledge related to these negative attitudes.

METHODS: Two focus groups of HR professionals were conducted to investigate guidelines and content areas that should be included in training. Data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis (QCA) methodology.
