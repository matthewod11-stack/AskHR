# In addition to my work

as an adjunct instructor and consultant, I conduct

workshops on conflict management and do workplace mediations. If conflicts can be acknowledged and addressed quickly, it is much less likely that lawsuits will arise and more likely that employee morale and productivity will remain at an acceptable level. At least 90% of conflict situations that I have handled have been resolved through mediation.

Mediation can work for almost any type of workplace conflict, such as that which occurs between supervisor and employee and between coworkers. However, for mediation to be successful, certain criteria must be met, which include willingness from all parties to try the process, a desire to solve the problem without litigation, and time to

mediate (because mediation may take several sessions). The role of a mediator is to be neutral and not judge who is right or wrong. A mediator is merely a facilitator of the communication process between the parties. If the parties get stuck and can’t think of a solution to their conflict, the mediator can suggest some ideas the parties may want to try. But ultimately, it should be their agreement, not the mediator’s.

A good example of how mediation can be successful in the workplace is a case I handled which involved two coworkers. One coworker was fairly new, eager to try out new ideas, and had an outgoing personality. The other coworker had been at the agency for over ten years, was quiet, and was very unaccepting of change. Their conflict arose because the older coworker felt that the new coworker was overstepping her boundaries and doing tasks that only the older coworker should have been doing. Also, the new coworker was trying to implement some changes that the other person was resistant to trying, mainly because she had not been allowed to provide her input. During mediation, they reached an agreement about what each person expected of the other. That is, they better defined

their job descriptions for each other. They also agreed to hold weekly meetings so that the older coworker could have input on any new ideas that were being proposed.

I often see conflict arise in organizations because of changes being made. Because most of us fear the unknown that change brings, it is easier not to try anything new. The key is to talk about what fears individuals have and then try to determine whether those fears are real and, if they are, how to overcome them. Mediation was very successful between the two coworkers in the previous example because they wanted to maintain a good working relationship. It’s very stressful to work with someone with whom you don’t get along. Mediation provides a safe place for people to discuss their differences and ways to resolve them, often reducing a great deal of this stress. Because parties get to find their own resolution, instead of being told how to handle the problem, it helps them feel more in control over decisions that affect their lives.

Being a mediator is a very

challenging, but rewarding, career. Knowing that I have been instrumental in helping people preserve their relationships and resolve their

differences has made all the hard work and hours I put into training for this position worthwhile.

If the time comes when you are asked to mediate, here are some tips that can help the session be successful. 7

Participate in conflict management training, first!

7

Talk separately to each individual involved in the conflict. Make sure the situation is right for mediation.

7

Make sure everyone is willing to mediate.

7

Assure all parties that you are neutral and will keep the process confidential.

7

Use your active listening skills and let them know you “hear” them.

7

Let the parties come up with ideas to resolve their conflict. I have been seeing more

and more human resource specialists pursue training in this area so they can better manager their organizations’ day-to-day conflicts.
