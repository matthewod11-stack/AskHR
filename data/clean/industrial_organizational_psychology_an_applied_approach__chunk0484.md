Here are some characteristics of well-written task statements:

One action should be done to one object. If the statement includes the word “and,” it may have more than one action or object. For example, the statement “Types correspondence to be sent to vendors” has one action and one object. However, “Types, ﬁ les, and sends correspondence to vendors” contains three very diﬀ erent actions (types, ﬁ les, sends). Task statements should be written at a level that can be read and understood by a person with the same reading ability as the typical job incumbent. All task statements should be written in the same tense. Th e task statement should include the tools and equipment used to complete the task. Task statements should not be competencies (e.g., “Be a good writer”). Task statements should not be a policy (e.g., “Treats people nicely”). Th e statement should make sense by itself. Th at is, “Makes photocopies” does not provide as much detail as “Makes photocopies of transactions for credit union members,” which indicates what types of materials are photocopied and for whom they are copied. For those activities that involve decision making, the level of authority should be indicated. Th is level lets the incumbent know which decisions she is allowed to make on her own and which she needs approval for from a higher level (Degner, ).

It has also been suggested that a few tasks not part of a job be placed into the task inventory; data from incumbents who rate these irrelevant tasks as part of their job are removed from the job analysis due to their carelessness (Green & Stutzman, ). Including “bogus tasks” is probably a good idea. Pine () included ﬁ ve such items in a -item task inventory for corrections oﬃ cers and found that % reported performing at least one of the bogus tasks. For example, a task inventory might include “operates a Gonkulator” or “uses PARTH program to analyze data” even though no such machine or computer program actually exists. A study by Dierdorﬀ and Rubin () found that incumbents who are low in cognitive ability and are confused about their work role (role ambiguity) are the most likely to endorse the bogus tasks on a task inventory.

Step 3: Rate Task Statements Once the task statements have been written (usually including some  tasks), the next step is to conduct a task analysis—using a group of SMEs to rate each task statement on the frequency and the importance or criticality of the task
