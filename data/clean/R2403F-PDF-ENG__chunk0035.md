The downside to decentralizing around autonomous P&Ls is a loss of

synergies, but there are remedies for that. ING, for instance, inspired by

tech companies’ agile models, loosely groups small multidisciplinary

teams into larger collectives for the purpose of coordinating bigger

tasks. When a project ﬁnishes, the team assigned to it disbands.

Functional experts in legal, ﬁnance, and operational risk are not

assigned to teams but can be called on to help out and give objective

advice. The system can ﬂex to meet new demands, but job titles and

reporting arrangements do not change.

Business leaders should also rethink how contract employees and

vendors are used. Almost 50 years ago, Charles Handy and John

Atkinson argued that contractors should do the peripheral work that

shifts when business needs and strategies change, allowing the core

of the business and its employees to remain stable. In recent decades

companies have done just the opposite and have resorted to using

contract workers and to outsourcing entire core functions, such as IT,

to drive down operating costs. In many cases that was a mistake because

the vendor couldn’t deliver or, worse, went out of business.
