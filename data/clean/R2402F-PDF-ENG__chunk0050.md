to establish a joint venture in order to provide more structure,

accountability, and resources for their team. The two founders believed

that was the only way for them to scale up. The ﬁrst collaboration

ultimately moved forward with diﬀerent partners, but the second is

thriving today.

The UI community had created a foundation for trusting relationships

that enabled the fellows to work in a ﬂexible manner, keeping

bureaucracy and governance to a minimum. But as the collaborations

scaled up, their organizational needs became more complex, and

addressing them required a renewed focus on building relationships.

While the fellows in the ﬁrst example were aware of the problem, they

had neither the time nor the resources to manage it successfully.

Again, this points to an opportunity for intermediaries, which have the

legitimacy to guide collaborators through this stage. An intermediary

can help in two ways:

Providing reﬂective checkpoints. By creating opportunities for

collaborators to get together in facilitated workshops, semistructured

calls, or in-person retreats, intermediaries can help venture teams

negotiate shifting roles and changing (or even new) relationships,

reestablish alignment, and introduce new governance structures.

These checkpoints oﬀer an opportunity for reﬂection, allowing social

entrepreneurs to step back and consider what they’ve learned in a

constructive fashion so that they can implement those lessons.

Checkpoints also help entrepreneurs manage their stress and emotions,

as the following stories of two social entrepreneurs outside UI

demonstrate. One young social entrepreneur who worked on a health

care venture told us that she ended up having a breakdown and

terminating her project. “I wish at the time I had a space to share
