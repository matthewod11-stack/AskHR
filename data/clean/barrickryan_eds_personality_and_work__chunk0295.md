# Managerial Performance

A host of managerial performance taxonomies are available to ex- pand on Campbell et al.’s (1993) supervision-leadership and management-administration components, two of which are ex- ceedingly comprehensive. Borman and Brush (1993) found 187 di- mensions of managerial performance from twenty-six published and unpublished studies. These dimensions were sorted into categories by twenty-ﬁve I/O psychologists, and factor analysis of a similarity matrix derived from these sortings yielded an eighteen-dimension structure. These dimensions are easily assigned to the task or citi- zenship performance categories or to one of Campbell et al.’s eight components (1993). Tett, Guterman, Bleier, and Murphy (2000) used a sorting method to develop a more speciﬁc managerial per- formance taxonomy of ﬁfty-three competencies. They include a cross-reference of how their taxonomy ﬁts with twelve other tax- onomies, including that of Borman and Brush (1993).
