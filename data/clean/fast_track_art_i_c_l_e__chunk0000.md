Objective: Examine the inﬂuence of employee health management (EHM) best practices on registration, participation, and health behavior change in telephone-based coaching programs. Methods: Individual health assessment data, EHM program data, and health coaching participation data were ana- lyzedforassociationswithcoachingprogramenrollment,activeparticipation, and risk reduction. Multivariate analyses occurred at the individual (n = 205,672) and company levels (n = 55). Results: Considerable differences were found in how age and sex impacted typical EHM evaluation metrics. Cash incentives for the health assessment were associated with more risk reduction for men than for women. Providing either a noncash or a beneﬁts- integrated incentive for completing the health assessment, or a noncash in- centive for lifestyle management, strengthened the relationship between age and risk reduction. Conclusions: In EHM programs, one size does not ﬁt all. These results can help employers tailor engagement strategies for their speciﬁc population.

BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW Employee health management (EHM) programs have be- come an accepted strategy to reduce employee health risks,1–5 re- duce health care costs,5 and improve employee productivity and presenteeism.6–8 Although there is growing evidence to support that EHM programs can produce a return on investment (ROI) to the employer,9–13 programsvaryconsiderablyregardingthelevelsofem- ployee participation and the attendant magnitude of health improve- mentand/orROIthathasbeenachievedinanemployeepopulation.14 As the ﬁeld of EHM has matured, several researchers and organi- zations have proposed employee EHM “best practices.”4,15–18 Best practice guidelines vary in how they were developed, with some that are evidence based,2,4,16 others that are conceptual models,17,19 and still others that are based on the consensus of experts.20–22

incentives for program participation, using data to inform program strategy, and tailoring worksite offerings according to the organi- zations’ unique risk proﬁle. Although the similarities between best practices guidelines and the scorecards that accompany them sug- gest that there is a growing understanding of the factors that best predict program success, there is a dearth of evidence concerning which factors are most important and whether these factors vary within or between organizations. Moreover, there is little evidence to demonstrate whether best practices components predict program success when age or sex diversity between or within organizations is considered.

There are various discrete components in a best practices framework, each of which is likely to carry differing weights relative to program effectiveness, but studies to guide program planners in what components are most important are limited. One recent study suggests that health assessment (HA) participation rates, as one in- dicator of success in EHM, are inﬂuenced, in order of importance, by the engagement of senior leadership, health beneﬁts design, and the use of branded communications.24 It is instructive to note that in this same report EHM program leaders were asked to self-assess which program components were most effective in reducing med- ical cost trends and their responses indicated, in order of impor- tance, ﬁnancial incentives, employee communications, and strategic planning carried the most weight. Furthermore, additional analy- sis indicated that one factor—the use of incentives—best predicted successful participation whereas another factor—program-branded communications—better predicted positive health improvements.24 Such ﬁndings indicate that although best practices are growing in importanceandpopularity, muchisyettobelearnedconcerninghow to best apply them toward improving program success.

Best practices guidelines, and the scorecards that accompany them, have been developed to guide EHM practitioners in program planning, administration, and evaluation associated with improved program effectiveness. The primary aim of most such best prac- tices guidelines is to increase the likelihood that the programs will produce population-level health outcomes along with garnering a positive ROI.23 The most widely used best practice guidelines rec- ommend institutionalizing support for EHM programs.4 Such best practices include developing a strategic plan, providing comprehen- sive program offerings, producing robust communications, offering
