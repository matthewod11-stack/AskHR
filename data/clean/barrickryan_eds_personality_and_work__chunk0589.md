# 188 PERSONALITY AND WORK

situation and thereby inﬂuences relationships between an indi- vidual’s traits and behavior.

Research at the individual level of analysis thus highlights the potential uniqueness of team settings. Interpersonal traits, partic- ularly Agreeableness, are better predictors of performance than they are in individually oriented settings. Much of this effect likely occurs through the interplay of team member traits, whereby the traits of one’s teammates inﬂuence relationships between one’s traits and behavior. Only limited research has been done in this area, but several theoretical perspectives suggest that future re- search may be a key to unlocking a better understanding of per- sonality in team settings.

From a practice perspective, research suggests that traits can be useful predictors of individual performance. Similar to non- team settings, Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are help- ful facilitators of task-oriented performance dimensions. In contrast to many individual performance settings, Agreeableness is a critical predictor of social inputs. These social inputs improve not only team viability but also the likelihood of synergistic actions that ultimately improve individual task performance. Neverthe- less, personality traits should be used cautiously as performance predictors in team settings, because the traits that lead to improved performance for an individual may have a negative inﬂuence on the inputs of others and thereby harm collective performance. Speciﬁc examples of such an effect, along with guidelines for prac- tice, will be described below in relation to a cross-level discussion of personality.
