## Decision : Use of Employee Comparisons, Objective Measures, or Ratings

Once the types of dimensions have been considered, the next decision is whether to evaluate performance by comparing employees with one another (ranking), using objective measures such as attendance and number of units sold, or having supervisors rate how well the employee has performed on each of the dimensions.

Employee Comparisons To reduce leniency, employees can be compared with one another instead of being rated individually on a scale. The easiest and most common of these meth- ods is the rank order. In this approach, employees are ranked in order by their judged performance for each relevant dimension. As Table . shows, the ranks are then averaged across each dimension to yield an overall rank.
