# leadership roles.

For frontline employees, some degree of unﬁltered authenticity may be

harmless, if not welcome. After all, it is generally better to identify with

your work persona than to experience a Marxist sense of alienation.

But the C-suite is not group therapy, nor a live TikTok session. The

higher you climb, the more your personal whims, biases, and blind

spots can reverberate across the entire organization—and the more

essential it becomes to maintain a clear boundary between what your

role demands and who you are “deep down” (which, incidentally, may

be hard to understand even if you endure decades of psychotherapy).
