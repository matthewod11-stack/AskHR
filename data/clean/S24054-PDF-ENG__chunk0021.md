## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

up their performance, you’re also keeping them from bringing down

everyone else’s. People don’t always appreciate this work, but it’s what

leaders must do.

I sometimes talk about inputs and outputs, and although that is mostly

about putting in the preparation and practice (inputs) to get a win

(output), it also refers to team composition. If you add the wrong players

to the mix—people who are undisciplined or self-centered—that’s a

negative input, and it will lead to negative outputs. By working with

those players to help them manage their emotions, leaders help to

improve both the inputs and the outputs.

Understand and complement the style of the formal leader. I spent

most of my career playing for Bill Belichick. He’s the greatest coach in

the history of the NFL, and many fans are familiar with his coaching

style. He’s very intense and matter-of-fact. He grew up as the son

of a coach at the Naval Academy, and that’s where he learned his

coaching style. He is a product of that rigorous military environment.

The focus was on discipline and accountability, not on empathy or

compassion. No matter how we played, Coach Belichick’s coaching

style was to motivate the team by looking for weaknesses and areas

to improve. There’s an argument that players need that. Pro athletes

have a lot of people in our lives—families, girlfriends, wives, agents,

fans—telling us how great we are. Coach Belichick always wanted to

keep us from buying into those narratives and becoming complacent.

We all felt fortunate to play for him, and there were many beneﬁts

to his approach, but his motivational style—often based on fear—was sometimes diﬃcult. So as a team leader, I tried to complement that

approach by being a bit more upbeat.
