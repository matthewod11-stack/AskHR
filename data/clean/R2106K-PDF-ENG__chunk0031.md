# ETHICS

assess and resolve the situation. Our existing prototypes then undergo an updating process. The more experience we have with varied moral situations, the more opportunities we have to learn and to reﬁne our prototypes.

employees learn on the job. Reﬂection is key. As the philos- opher John Kekes has written, “insuﬃcient reﬂection leads to loss of self-control, ignorance of oneself, and to a failure to align one’s ideals and moral vision.” Management scholars have identiﬁed reﬂection as a critical capacity for developing ethical expertise at work. Drawing on psychological con- cepts such counterfactual thinking (envisioning alternatives to events that have already occurred), social comparisons (evaluating one’s attitude, abilities, and traits in relation to others’), and mental simulation (projecting oneself into hypothetical realities), they have persuasively argued that employees cannot learn from experience without engaging in moral reﬂection.
