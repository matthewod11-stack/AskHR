# System Efficiency

Figure A.1 Layout of a fast-food counter (The numbers indicate the number of times the counterperson walked to get a particular item.)

A major human-factors area, at times referred to as “time and motion studies,” is making systems more eﬃ cient. Th ese studies usually begin with a job analysis to determine how employees perform their jobs. Th ese job analyses tend to be much more speciﬁ c than the ones you learned about back in Chapter . For example, suppose you were trying to reduce the time it took for a counterperson at a fast- food restaurant to perform his job. As shown in Figure A., the employee reached for ketchup packets  times, pepper packets  times, french-fry containers  times, and french fries  times. What is wrong with the current layout? As you probably guessed, one of the most frequently retrieved items (ketchup) is farthest away, and the least frequently retrieved item (pepper) is closest.
