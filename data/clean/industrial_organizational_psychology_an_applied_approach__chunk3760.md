Human-factors psychologists are often employed by organizations to improve the “user friendliness” of products. Examples might include determining the best layout for a computer keyboard, choosing the optimal size for the ﬁ nger holes in a pair of scissors, or designing an automobile dashboard to reduce the distance a driver needs to reach to play the car stereo.

A good example of product design comes from a study by Dempsey et al. (), who were asked to help design the ideal satchel to be carried by postal workers. To do this, they tested four diﬀ erent satchels to determine which one was most comfortable, worked best in diverse climates, was easiest to use, and provided the best protection against attacking dogs. Th e results of their study indicated that the most comfortable bag also provided the worst protection against attacking dogs and had some problems with ease of mail retrieval.

A similar study was conducted by Pascoe, Pascoe, Wang, Shim, and Kim () in designing book bags. Pascoe and his colleagues compared the eﬀ ect that three types of bags—two-strap backpack, one-strap backpack, and one- strap athletic bag—had on the posture and gait of the student wearing the book bag. When compared with no book bag, all three types reduced stride length and increased stride frequency. Furthermore, the one-strap backpack and one- strap athletic bag resulted in uncomfortable changes in posture. However, the two-strap backpack did not result in such changes. Th us, the practical aspects of this study suggest that students should buy a backpack with two straps and, even though it is not as cool as slinging one strap over one shoulder, use both straps.

Th e search for the ideal work glove provides another example of product design studies. Th is search took two paths: one that investigated the eﬀ ects of wearing gloves and another that compared the advantages of certain types of gloves over others. Th ough gloves clearly increase worker safety, their eﬀ ect on work performance depends on the type of task performed. For example, research- ers have found that wearing gloves increases muscle fatigue (Fleming, Jansen, & Hasson, ) and decreases the amount of turning force (the authors of the study called this “maximum volitional torque exertion of supination”) that can be exerted by a worker (Shih & Wang, ), but does not aﬀ ect the ability to dis- criminate weights (Shih & Wang, ).

An example of a study searching for the optimal glove comes from Nelson and Mital (), who investigated the optimal thickness for examination gloves used by physicians (ouch!). Th eir study was conducted because although thicker gloves provide greater protection against needle sticks, they might also reduce the ability of the physician to perform sensitive work. Th e researchers tested ﬁ ve gloves ranging in thickness from . mm to . mm. Nelson and Mital found that the .-mm glove not only resisted routine impacts but provided the same level of dexterity and tactility as a bare hand. Th ough neither bags nor gloves are particularly exciting topics, these examples show the meticulous human-factors research that goes into the development of good products.
