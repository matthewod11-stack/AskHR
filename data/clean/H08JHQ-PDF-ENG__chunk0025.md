# measure their progress by.

Begin by documenting the areas of concern and the actions to be taken

to improve their performance. This should be done in consultation with

the employee so that they understand what’s expected of them, and

it may take a few meetings to put into place. Include milestones and

check-in dates where you can meet to give them feedback on their

progress and learn how it’s going from their perspective.

If they’re hitting roadblocks, you can use these check-ins to address

those and tweak the plan as needed. Set an agreed-upon and reasonable

date to draw the process to an end, which will vary depending on the

progress being made.

. . .

Lastly, remember that how you say something and the words you use to express your feedback and intentions makes all the diﬀerence. You

can provide the most diﬃcult or harsh feedback in a humane and caring

way if you think of it as helping develop your employee. That said, there

will be people who won’t accept that they have performance issues and

will not be happy with you for confronting them. That’s okay.

Unfortunately, being a great people manager is not about being a friend

or being liked by everyone all the time. People want a boss who cares

about them and helps them get their job done. A great people manager

can communicate their organization’s strategic intent and how their

team members’ work is contributing to it.
