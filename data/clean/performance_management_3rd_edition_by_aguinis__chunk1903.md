# Chapter 11 • Managing Team Performance

- 2. Efficiency. This is the degree to which internal team processes support the achieve- ment of results, team growth, and team member satisfaction. This can include meas- ures of communication, coordination, collaboration, and decision making.

- 3. Learning and growth. This is the degree to which the team is able to learn new skills and improve performance over time. Specific measures can include innova- tion, documented learning, best practices, and process improvements.

- 4. Team member satisfaction. This is the degree to which team members are satisfied with their team membership. Specific measures can include team members’ per- ceptions regarding the extent to which teamwork contributes to their growth and personal well-being.

In total, there should not be more than about 15 measures of overall team performance;22 otherwise, team members may spend too much time collecting information and monitoring their activities such that there is insufficient time to work on their assigned tasks. In addition, when the team has a meeting to assess its own overall performance, it is helpful to include a person from outside the team as part of the performance discussion. This helps team members to be as objective as possible when they evaluate their performance.
