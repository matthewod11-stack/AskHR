Sensitivity Training: The fundamental goal of sensitivity training is to increase awareness and sensitivity to one's own and other people's behavioural patterns. Increased social skills, greater empathy, tolerance for individual diversity, reduced racial prejudice, awareness of group dynamics, better listening abilities, and an increase in trust and support are the results of this. It fosters management empathy, confidence, and respect for others.

Simulation: In this technique, the scenario is reenacted in a way that has more resemblance to the actual working environment. The students have the impression that they are genuinely going through each situation. The trainees are expected to play a specific role and are required to make choices that will address the issues. Immediately after a trainee's performance, feedback is offered.
