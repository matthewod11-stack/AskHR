# Wide-Range Achievement Test

In the United States, formal achievement testing began in the schools during the early 1920s. Tests of speciﬁc competen- cies (e.g., spelling) had been developed prior to that time, but group-administered batteries for assessing a broad range of academic skills began with the 1923 publication of the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT), which was designed for use with elementary school students. This was followed in 1925 by the Iowa High School Content Examination, later called the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, designed for use with older students. Contemporary versions of the Stanford and Iowa scholastic achievement measures remain widely used for group testing in elementary and secondary schools.

Individual assessment of academic skills can be traced to the late 1930s, when Joseph Jastak (1901–1979), then at Columbia University, became acquainted with David Wechsler’s work on developing scales for the Wechsler- Bellevue.Jastakcametotheconclusionthatfullyadequateas- sessment of cognitive functioning required supplementing Wechsler’sscaleswithsomemeasuresofbasiclearningskills, especially reading, writing, and calculating. To this end, he began constructing measures that involved recognition and pronunciation of words, a written spelling test, and a written arithmetictest.Aninstrumentcomprisingthesethreemeasures was published as theWide-RangeAchievementTest (WRAT) in 1946 (Jastak, 1946). Later versions of this instrument, con- sistingofessentiallythesamereading,spelling,andarithmetic tests as the original, have appeared as the WRAT-R (Jastak & Wilkinson(1984)andtheWRAT3(Wilkinson,1993).

In common with most of the other measures discussed in this chapter, the WRAT has been remarkable for its longevity and widespread use. Its normative data make it applicable for age 5 through adulthood, and it has become a standard as- sessment tool not only in academic settings but in clinical and neuropsychological practice. The previously cited survey of test usage by Camara et al. (2000) show the WRAT as the seventh most frequently used test by clinical psychologists and ninth most frequently used test by neuropsychologists.
