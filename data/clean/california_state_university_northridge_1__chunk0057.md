## What the Literature Says About Wrongful Termination

In an article written by Charles E. Ramirez, titled "Employee Handbooks are Essential

at the Workplace" focuses on the importance and benefits of a handbook. Mr. Ramirez begins

stating that employee handbooks are not read by most employees and new hires in particular.
