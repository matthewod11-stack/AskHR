# goals?

- What are we doing that is keeping us from reaching these goals?

- What opportunities should we take advantage of that we currently

aren’t?

- If you were in charge, what would you continue, stop, or start

doing?

Your aim is not to come to neat conclusions but to surface new ideas

that might have been dismissed or unvoiced in the past. Diﬀerent

views will inevitably surface, and some conﬂict may even erupt —

that’s all right. Just keep bringing the conversation back to the team’s

shared goals and emphasize that diﬀerences of opinion are valued
