## Is an Employee Predisposed to Being Motivated?

Psychologists have postulated that some employees are more predisposed to being motivated than are others. That is, some employees come to most jobs with a tendency to be motivated, whereas others come with the tendency to be unmotivated. You can probably think of people you know who always appear to be motivated and “gung-ho,” and you can probably think of others whom no amount of money would motivate. Researchers have found three individual dif- ference traits that are most related to work motivation: self-esteem, an intrinsic motivation tendency, and need for achievement.
