Make coming in worthwhile. “Nothing will tick oﬀ an employee more than coming all the way into the oﬃce and being on a Zoom all day,”

says Markman. It’s crucial, he says, to create an engaging in-person

work environment by providing team members with opportunities to

learn from colleagues, participate in high-level meetings, or collaborate

with diﬀerent teams. Early-career workers particularly beneﬁt from

observing experienced colleagues, he says. “It’s harder to internalize the

goals of what the next job entails if you’re not able to see how others

work.”

Kulik suggests motivating skeptical team members by focusing on

building strong individual relationships, providing tailored feedback,

oﬀering exposure to clients, and assigning them to challenging, high-

proﬁle projects that can help them see the impact of their work. The goal is to “help employees see that there are things they get at the oﬃce

they don’t get at home,” Kulik says. She advises talking to your bosses

about using discretionary budget to launch events and initiatives to make going back to the oﬃce more enticing, including social events that

build a sense of community.

Markman also suggests emphasizing to your bosses and boss’s bosses

the signiﬁcance of being visible to the rank and ﬁle. “Prior to the

pandemic, a lot of upper-level management disappeared into higher

ﬂoors. But they need to walk the halls, show their presence, and

engage,” he says.

Celebrate the wins. The downsides of returning to work are about as inevitable as ﬁnding fragrant leftovers in the oﬃce fridge. Which is why,

according to Markman, you need to be extra vigilant about celebrating

the positive moments of bringing everyone back together. That could

be an energetic and productive team meeting or a spontaneous idea

sparked by casual conversations over donuts in the breakroom.
