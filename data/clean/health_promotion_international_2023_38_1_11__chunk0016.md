Organizational and spatial-material dimensions of belonging and workplace health Our analysis clearly demonstrates that employees con- nect workplace health to the physical/psychological dimension of belonging. The relationship with organ- izational and spatio-material dimensions of belonging was less explicitly mentioned. However, we observed a strong relationship between the different dimensions of belonging.

(Un)belonging to the industrial production company Employees of the industrial production company shared that the company’s divisions and depart- ments all comprised different atmospheres which they commonly referred to as the different islands of the company. These islands were divided between the departments working in and around the factory, on one hand, and those working in the office buildings, on the other hand. The atmosphere on the islands was generally considered good. However, the connection between departments was experienced to be lacking, as an employee observed: ‘In earlier times, departments were more one, whereas now, people work for the suc- cess of each department, not so much for the whole company’ (field notes). The perceived island structure also impacted the mutual understanding for working conditions, like the understanding of office workers for the dangerous tasks operators perform:

Let them [from the office] walk along during shitty tasks in the heat, while wearing these combat suits. Here, we are always in the danger angle; nothing will happen to them. With this heat, they have air conditioning and call the canteen lady to bring them something to drink (field notes).

The island structure of the industrial production company resembles what Hsiao et al. (Hsiao et al., 2017) have called organizational distance to describe ‘the degree to which alliance members are similar or dissimilar in terms of demographic characteristics, such as business practices, operational mechanisms, corporate culture, and management style’ (p. 639). In the industrial production company this meant that, although working in a good and supportive atmos- phere within departments, employees experienced a large organizational distance between departments had to do with a lack of understanding.

Considering ways to reduce the organizational dis- tance, some employees suggested internal exchanges between departments to bridge the islands and to increase the mutual understanding:
