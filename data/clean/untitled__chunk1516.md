## Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

Founded in 1937, the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI) was one of the earliest groups to advo- cate for social action research. Despite its commitment to so- cial justice, however, SPSSI did not focus on women’s issues until the 1970s. With the women’s movement of the 1970s, the number of women in the discipline increased and SPSSI’s membership changed. During the 1980s and 1990s, women assumed leadership roles in SPSSI. The Journal of Social Issues, as well as SPSSI’s workshops, conferences, and meet- ing programs, have addressed issues of women and gender (Katz, 1991). Moreover, many other topics that SPSSI has addressed, such as poverty, homelessness, pornography, and immigration, are directly relevant to women’s lives.
