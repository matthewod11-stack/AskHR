and handle complaints effectively. In the wake of an absence in local personnel, federal agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) threaten to be overworked, and their response time would likely slow, effectively diminishing the capacity of noncompliance deterrence. Moreover, the budgetary priorities differ in states. The more the state is in high compliance, the more it acquires public funds towards improvements in accessibility, legal aid programs, and disability services. The low-compliance states usually invest less in the mechanism that helps them implement ADA, as these states usually focus on other areas. 5.2 Employer Awareness and Training Employers are the key element of ADA implementation, because their interest in understanding and following the law influences the opportunity of disabled employees to receive equal jobs in employment opportunities. In states where the compliance records are good, education of employers is usually required and is usually provided by the state agencies and advocates (Stein & Bantekas, 2021). These states can make ADA training during onboarding or provide incentives to incorporate inclusive work-related projects. Comparatively speaking, the employees in most non-compliance areas remain ignorant of their employee rights as stated in the ADA due to ignorance by their bosses, especially the small to medium enterprises (Helmi et al., 2024). They might not know how to perform a reasonable accommodation or undertake an interactive process with employees with disabilities. The opinion exists that accommodation will be very expensive, but the majority of accommodations happen to be no-cost or low-cost. Employers will not attach more importance to accessibility without strong educational programmes and previous outreach. Prejudiced attitudes toward disability, a shortage of internal HR resources, and a responsive approach toward complaints are the factors that drive the lack of compliance. This is specifically the case when rural and low-income regions do not offer much in terms of access to professional development. 5.3 Disability Advocacy Networks and Legal Aid The availability and the intensity of disability advocacy groups are also key determinants of the implementation of the ADA. Besides enabling people to negotiate legal proceedings, these networks also conduct community education, lawsuits, and advocacy for better policies. States that have active advocacy groups, like Disability Rights California or the Boston Center of Independent Living, have more noticeable enforcement mechanisms and practices and more knowledgeable citizens (Pendo, 2021). These organizations will tend to keep track of compliance in the public and private sectors, help in filing complaints, and represent the clients in court. Their presence compels employers and state departments to influence in more open and non- discriminatory ways. The availability of legal aid is an issue, too. There are limited disability law practitioners in many states, especially those where the poverty level is high or where there is poor infrastructure in the
