# Interpersonal Skills and Teamwork:

Every employee should also attend a one-day seminar on interpersonal skills and

team work/team building. The areas to be covered in the seminars would range from

effective communications to team work and group problem-solving. Employees who

possess these techniques enhance their ability to work together and solve organizational

problems. Training can be organized around certain group problem-solving tasks, with

groups meeting periodically , to assess and study a particular process or product, so they

can be in a position to recommend a solution to a particular problem. Seminars cost -on

the average of about $100-$150 per person. The cost to Employers ' Training Resource

Intake and Assessment department would be $5250 (35 employees @ $150).
