# 5.4. Leadership

The variable of leadership, or supervisory relation- ship, has a consistent relationship with job satisfaction and intent to leave in both early and recent studies (Sorrentino, 1992; McNeese-Smith, 1995; Chiok Foong Loke, 2001; Fang, 2001; Fletcher, 2001; Yin and Yang, 2002; Larrabee et al., 2003). Nursing leadership style, or supervisory relationship, is a phenomenon of interna- tional relevance that is linked to the work environment. Fletcher’s (2001) study suggested that job dissatisfaction ensues when nurse managers fail to give due recognition and support, disregard stafﬁng issues and neglect to address problems. Furthermore, Larrabee et al. (2003) asserted that the main effect on intent to leave was a decrease in job satisfaction through a lack of empower- ment perceived by nurses to be a result of leadership style. This suggests that when stafﬁng levels are reduced, as they are for today’s profession, leadership that encompasses an open, empowering approach to staff may be able to buffer low retention. Transformational

leadership style engenders motivation of others to pursue high standards, concentrates on creating open communication and a willingness to embrace change (Morrison et al., 1997; Upenieks, 2003). This would seem most desirable for a profession that experiences much change and that has expressed concern about supervisory relations to a point that it negatively affects turnover and possibly quality of care (McNeese-Smith, 1993; Davidson et al., 1997; Needleman and Buerhaus, 2003). Introduction of participative styles of manage- ment is central to the human resource proposals of the NHS Plan (DH, 2000), but change in leadership behaviour may not be easily obtained if this is not placed high on the agenda for managers (Finlayson et al., 2002).

5.5. Pay

Nurses’ pay has been measured as a component on to many scales, although early studies contribute little to job satisfaction (Blegen and Mueller, 1987; Blegen, 1993; Irvine and Evans, 1995). However, the issue of pay and its contribution to job satisfaction increases in importance when nurses perceive discrepan- cies between their remuneration and that of other professions (Tovey and Adams, 1999). This was reiterated in the written comments obtained in the studies of Fletcher (2001) and Cowin (2002). It has also been suggested that perceived lack of reward contributes to role disengagement (Demerouti et al., 2000) and, although pay was not found to exert an effect on intent to leave in these studies, such perceptions have the potential to become inﬂuential. Comments from the participants of Cowin’s (2002) study suggesting that pay was not an issue only when other factors were satisfying reiterates this possibility. It is further supported by the dissatisfaction expressed by participants regarding the discrepancy between the high responsibility of the job and perceived low pay. As roles for nurses expand, and their responsibility increases, for dissatisfaction and intent to leave could be ampliﬁed in the UK.
