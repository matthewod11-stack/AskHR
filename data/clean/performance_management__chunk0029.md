# Feedback and Goal-Setting

In many instances, feedback decreases rather than increases performance. There- fore, training coaches in how to provide feed- back and set goals is critical to an effective coaching process. For feedback to bring about a positive change in behavior, a coach must: (1) focus on the behavior rather than the person; (2) be selective as to the ‘‘critical few’’ so as not to overwhelm the person; and (3) focus on the desired behavior rather than the undesired, as well as ways to demon- strate it. Sensitivity and tact in giving feed- back is critical for bringing about a change in behavior. Thus, (4) honesty should not be confused with hurtfulness.

Feedback in the absence of goal setting has little or no effect on behavior, because feed- back in itself is only information; its effect on action depends on how the recipient under- stands it, and what decisions are made with respect to it. For feedback to improve beha- vior, (5) speciﬁc high goals must be set, and the individual must be committed to meeting those goals, because goal setting affects choice, effort and persistence.
