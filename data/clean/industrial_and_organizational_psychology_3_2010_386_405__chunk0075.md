# increase cross-fertilization

OBHDP is an ongoing attempt at cross-fertilization. Although both JDM and IOOB researchers publish in OBHDP, the extent of cross-fertilization has been very limited despite the fact that there are several JDM topics that IOOB researchers should be following closely and vice versa (Naylor, 1984). Additional ways to increase cross-fertilization include topic-based interdisciplinary efforts (e.g., goal-setting and rater judgment errors) as well as interdisciplinary workshops or symposia at SIOP. The challenge has been, and remains, how to institutionalizethe cross-fertilization

OBHDP does serve to illustrate the beneﬁts, to IOOB, of having a common paradigm on which to evaluate the merit of submitted research. At OBHDP, acceptance rates appear to be higher, and review times shorter, for the JDM section than for the IOOB section.

Examples of ways in which JDM could beneﬁt from IOOB

The focus in IOOB on psychometrics, methodology, individual differences, and within-person phenomena are likely to be beneﬁcial to JDM.

Note. JDM = the ﬁeld of judgment and decision making; IOOB = the ﬁeld of industrial–organizational psychology and the related ﬁeld of organizational behavior and human resources; OBHDP = the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes; SIOP = Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.
