## about a company’s commitment to equity and inclusion.

For example, Microsoft states: “We strive to create an environment that

brings the power of diversity to life.” According to Meta: “Diversity isn’t

optional. To bring the world closer together, diversity is a must-have…

not an option.” Nike proclaims: “…we know the greatest ideas come

from a variety of lived experiences, which is why we are committed

to a workplace that is diverse, equitable, and accessible. Where our

teammates feel seen, heard, and included. Where they belong and can

become their very best selves.”
