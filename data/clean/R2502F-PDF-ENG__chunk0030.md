# Don’t Adapt Rituals, Co-Create New Ones

Cross-cultural negotiations are further complicated by rituals—the

established and sometimes symbolic actions, behaviors, or even

ceremonies through which people convey messages and meaning

within a social or cultural group. If all members in a group accept and

adopt similar rituals, social interactions become smoother, faster, more

pleasant, and automatic. In other words, rituals are culturally approved

shortcuts for communicating important messages eﬃciently within a

group. They facilitate the process of relationship building.
