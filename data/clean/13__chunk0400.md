## The Past, Present, and Future of Dynamic Performance Research

81

The techniques to which I am referring have been called covariance components models, hierarchical linear models, hierarchical models, latent curve analysis, latent growth models, mixed models, mixed linear models, multilevel models, multilevel linear models, random effects models, and random coefﬁcient models (Raudenbush, 2001). In actuality, these many names essentially represent two approaches, which I will review below. Furthermore, although there are different approaches to estimate these models, fortunately there are common characteristics that make a general framework applicable to understanding the modeling of individual performance trends (Raudenbush, 2001).

For all these approaches, job performance over time is now typically thought of as a multilevel problem, with individuals’ performance scores over time nested within individuals. Typically, the within-person scores are referred to as the ﬁrst-level (i.e., Level-1), whereas individual-characteristics are at the second-level (i.e., Level-2). Conceivable, more levels are possible, including dyads, teams, departments, organizations, industries, and nations (cf., Ployhart, 2004); however, research on dynamic performance has yet to expand to such domains.

A simple Level-1 model capturing the linear effects of time would appear

as follows:
