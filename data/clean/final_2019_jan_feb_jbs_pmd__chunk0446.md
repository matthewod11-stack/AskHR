As we have found a statistically significant result we need to do post hoc tests.Tukey post hoc tests are used to compare each of the conditions to every other condition. A Tukey post hoc test revealed that the age group <30 (1.914 ± .45 min, p<.05) is significantly different from 30-50 (3.95 ±, 43 min, p < .05) and >50(2.82 ± .23 min,P<.05). A comparison of

30-50(3.95 ±, 43 min, p < .05) also is found to be significantly different when compared to <30 (1.914 ± .45 min, p<.05) and >50(2.82 ± .23 min,P<.05). The third pair wise comparison of >50(2.82 ± .23 min,P<.05) is found to be significantly different from the other two groups.
