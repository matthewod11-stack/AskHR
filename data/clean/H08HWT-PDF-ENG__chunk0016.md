## HBR / Digital Article / Train Your Brain to Work Creatively with Gen AI

For example, you may have an idea for a speciﬁc pasta dish to cook

for dinner, but you don’t have all the ingredients at home and don’t

feel motivated to visit the grocery store for everything else you need.

A creative human/AI collaboration could look at new outcomes that

would not have been considered otherwise.

One idea is to share the ingredients you do have with gen AI: “I have two

red tomatoes, chicken breast, olive oil, salt, and white onion. What are

some recipes I can consider for making dinner for two tonight?”

The alternatives sound appetizing:

- Chicken Breast with Tomato and Onion Sauté

- Tomato and Chicken Stir-Fry

- Chicken and Tomato Salad

- Tomato Chicken Skillet

Not only did alternative ideas come up in the moment, but easy-to-

follow recipes were also included.

You don’t have to stop there. If you’re not 100% satisﬁed with the

results, you could ask it to regenerate ideas or guide it with more

speciﬁc details or nuances, i.e., provide recipes under X number of

calories, only recipes for baking or air frying, etc.

You can also experiment in fun ways by adding your personality into

the mix and exploring unconventional, radical, or previously impossible

requests. This makes the output more creative, surprising, and mind-

blowing. For example, add details like country or region, style, cooking

time, or lifestyle preferences. Or take it to the next level by asking for

recipes to help you cook in the style of your favorite celebrity chef, from

any century (just as long as they’re in the LLM!). Then, ask it to provide
