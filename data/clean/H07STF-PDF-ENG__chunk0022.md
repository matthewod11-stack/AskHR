# right?

One person I’ve been interviewing extensively over the last couple years was chief compliance oﬃcer at her organization, and she’s become

a documentary ﬁlmmaker. She had to start at the bottom, as an

apprentice. It depends.

Other people move into something that’s more adjacent, maybe doing it

more entrepreneurially. And they don’t have to, they can really leverage

the skillset and the experience that they’ve had, albeit in a very diﬀerent

role and setting. It depends a lot.
