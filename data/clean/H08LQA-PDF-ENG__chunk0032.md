## HBR / The Big Idea / When Employees Take Sabbaticals, Organizations Benefit

Managers should ensure that leave-takers have no access to email or

other work communications during their time away. Best practice is to have them set clear out-of-oﬃce messages, auto-delete their emails, and

designate one colleague they can contact or who can contact them only

if absolutely necessary. For example, ﬁnancial services ﬁrm Brighton

Jones requires employees who take advantage of its paid sabbatical

program to fully transfer responsibilities, uninstall its email program,

and provide only an emergency phone number.

Another way to help people disconnect is to give them ample time

to prepare for leaving. I suggest 18 months to sort out ﬁnances and

personal matters, delegate professional responsibilities, and plan the

time oﬀ. You’ll also need to give them enough runway to readjust to

work before they launch back into mission-critical business.

. . .

We’ve all seen companies try to engender loyalty by piling on perks

like Ping-Pong tables and free snacks. Oﬀering sabbaticals would be far

more meaningful: They generate goodwill, boost employee engagement,

and improve team and organizational performance. That’s because the

gift of time is a rare and valuable one.

Although extended-leave policies are more of an exception than the

norm, organizations would be wise to accelerate their adoption. Doing

so would help people fulﬁll their personal dreams and aspirations,

build in recovery time, and live their lives without regret — all while

retaining the many psychological, social, and ﬁnancial beneﬁts that

work provides. And that’s a win-win for employees and employers.
