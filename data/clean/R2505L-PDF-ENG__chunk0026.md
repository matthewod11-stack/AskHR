# Joseph Ernst/The Sideline Collective

The importance of early monitoring is seen in the case mentioned above

of Wayfair, which in July 2020 became aware of a conspiracy theory

alleging that the company was involved in child traﬃcking. Social

media posts claimed that extremely high-priced cabinets and pillows on

Wayfair’s site were actually fronts for selling missing children, pointing

to product names that coincidentally matched the names of missing

kids. What started as a conversation on Reddit quickly spread across

Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Wayfair monitored social

media chatter and trending keywords as the story gained traction, with

“Wayfair” being mentioned alongside traﬃcking claims and hashtags

like #WayfairGate. Within a few days, the conspiracy posts amassed

millions of views on TikTok and other platforms. An analysis showed

that ampliﬁers were known information inﬂuencers who had previously

spread conspiracy theories, conﬁrming the need to respond—rather

than remain silent—to avoid long-lasting reputational damage.
