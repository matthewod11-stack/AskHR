## HBR / Magazine Article / How to Counter Fake News

Now consider the example of a company that didn’t recognize the

spread of fake news quickly enough. In November 2024, the Danish-

Swedish dairy company Arla Foods became aware of fake news

spreading about its use of the cow-feed additive Bovaer, which the

company trialed to reduce methane emissions in dairy herds on UK

farms. The supplement had been approved by the European Food Safety

Authority and the UK’s Food Standards Agency, and it had been in

commercial use since 2021. Despite scientiﬁc evidence that Bovaer

didn’t pose a health risk to humans or animals, social media posts on

X accused Arla Foods of poisoning consumers. Videos showed angry

customers pouring Arla milk down the sink and throwing Arla butter

in the trash. The baseless concerns were ampliﬁed and legitimized by

farmers, many of whom posted on social media that they opposed the

use of Bovaer, and by a member of the UK parliament, who demanded

on X that authorities carry out an urgent review of it. Although other

dairy brands also used the additive, the fake news targeted mainly Arla

Foods. The company eventually responded but only after the story had

been widely ampliﬁed.

- 2. Ensure transparency. To eﬀectively ﬁght fake news, companies must

demonstrate their credibility. The best way to do that is to expose their

processes to customers’ and other stakeholders’ scrutiny before a crisis hits. Companies can then enlist those stakeholders, who can oﬀer their personal validation to eﬀorts to dispel false information.
