results from situational factors than dispositional factors (Triandis, 1994). This prediction is consistent with the operation of a correspondence bias (Hamilton & Sherman, 1994) in individualistic cultures (Mackie et al., 1996). The same prediction has important implications for HRM processes and practices. For example, consider the attributions that are likely when people in the U.S. are presented with evidence that African-Americans are found largely in low-level jobs. Whereas people with individualistic views would be likely to infer that this resulted from a lack of motivation on the part of African-Americans, people with collective views (e.g., Colombians) would be prone to attribute the same evidence to such situational factors as unequal educational opportunities, biased hiring practices, and biases in job assignments.

Representative Research on Cognitive Reactions. Below we consider research on cross-cultural differences several potentially stigmatizing attributes of individuals. In the interest of brevity we focus on a limited set of studies.
