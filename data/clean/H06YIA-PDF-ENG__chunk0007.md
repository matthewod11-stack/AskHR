# Illustration by Samuel Finch

Companies regularly shake up their organization structure, whether

it’s due to a change in strategy, a change in leadership, or for other

reasons. Most of these changes are incremental, while a few are

radical. In our decades-long experience, we’ve observed a leap-and-

hops pattern in which a series of minor adjustments is followed by a

major rearrangement, after which the cycle starts all over again.
