to one that is more empathic and soothing. Though layoff victims remain fearful for much of the layoff period, they eventually move to the acceptance stage. At this stage, the victims accept that the layoff will occur and are now ready to take steps to secure their future. It is at this last stage that employees are ready for specific offers of assistance. Financial Counseling. As layoff victims move through the fear stage into the accep- tance stage, financial counseling is needed. They are under tremendous stress as they worry about how to make their rent, mortgage, and loan payments and how to pay for utilities, insurance, food, tuition, and medical and dental costs. Most banks and credit unions have certified financial counselors who are well trained in helping people with these concerns. The financial counseling process should include the issues of severance pay, unemployment insurance, medical insurance, and any special programs that might be available to help the layoff victims. Career Assessment and Guidance. Though many layoff victims will search for jobs similar to the ones that they left, many will need to consider other careers. Psychologists involved in this process will administer a battery of tests that tap an individual’s basic abilities (e.g., math, grammar), transferable skills (e.g., wood- working, typing), career interests, and work values (e.g., status, independence, leadership). In discussing potential careers, consideration must be given to such life realities as financial needs, time constraints (e.g., “I can’t take four years to earn a degree”), and geographic constraints (e.g., “I want to stay near my family” or “My spouse has a good job and I can’t leave the immediate area”). For employ- ees willing and able to relocate or go back to school, finding a new job is not as difficult as it is for employees who are limited to a particular geographic area and are not able or willing to be retrained. A major issue that arises during this process is the ability of a layoff victim to obtain new training. Jobs in the twenty-first century require higher levels of skill than did their earlier counterparts. So retraining is often necessary to get a new job. However, barriers such as funding and day-care problems, the lack of rel- evant training sites, and fear of going back to school can keep layoff victims from getting the new training they so desperately need. organization development 539 540 chapter  To help layoff victims find new employment, workshops are conducted on such topics as understanding the job market, finding potential job openings, writing résumés, performing well in the employment interview, and making deci- sions about job offers. Eﬀ ects of Downsizing Victims Research is clear that there are many negative consequences to losing one’s job. From a health perspective, victims of downsizing report increases in headaches, stomach upsets, sleeping problems, cholesterol levels, physical illness, hospital- ization rates, heart trouble, hypertension, ulcers, vision problems, and shortness of breath. Emotionally, victims report high levels of stress, increased drug and alcohol abuse, more marital problems, and feelings of depression, unhappiness, anger, frustration, and dissatisfaction with life. Socially, victims are reluctant to share their feelings with friends, avoid family and friends due to feelings of embarrassment and shame, and avoid social situations and entertainment requir- ing money. To reduce the effects of downsizing, Beyer and colleagues () have this
