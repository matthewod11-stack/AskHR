## perform complex multistep tasks in the near future.

Meanwhile, technology companies, from tech giants to smaller ﬁrms and startups, are oﬀering platforms and tools for creating

autonomous agents and systems. Microsoft’s AutoGen is an open-source

programming framework for building such agents and coordinating

them to perform tasks. It enables agents that can converse with other

agents and can help create both autonomous and human-in-the-loop

workﬂows. Meta’s React is a free, open-source JavaScript library for

building user interfaces, including with autonomous agents. Amazon

Web Services recently introduced Amazon Q, which helps users set

up semiautonomous AI agents that perform various tasks, including

writing and debugging code. Google’s Vertex AI Agent Builder and

Semantic Kernel open-source development kit also help you easily

build AI agents and integrate the latest AI models into your code

base. OpenAI’s Assistants API allows users to create agents within their own applications. The San Francisco–based startup LangChain oﬀers

an open-source framework for building applications based on large

language models. LlamaIndex helps users build context-augmented

gen AI applications, including autonomous agents and workﬂows.

GenWorlds provides a platform for creating environments where AI

agents interact with one another to execute complex tasks. MemGPT

enables agent chatbots that can learn about you and modify their own
