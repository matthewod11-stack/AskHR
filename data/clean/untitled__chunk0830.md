# Intelligence

McNemar, 1951). Second, factor analyses have sometimes been not so much misintepreted as overinterpreted. What one gets out of a factor analysis is simply a psychometric trans- formation of what one puts in. It is possible to support many different possible theories by choosing one’s tests with a cer- tain goal in mind. The resulting factors simply reﬂect the choice of tests and their interrelationships. Third, in ex- ploratory factor analysis, the rotation issue has proven to be a thorny one. Any rotation is mathematically correct and equiv- alent in Euclidean space. Arguments over which theory is correct often have boiled down to little more than arguments over which rotation is psychologically more justiﬁed. But no adequate basis has been found for supporting one rotation as psychologically preferred over all others. Fifth and ﬁnally, the whole issue of deriving a theory of intelligence from patterns of individual differences has never received fully adequate examination by differential psychologists. Evolu- tionary theorists (e.g., Pinker, 1997; see R. J. Sternberg & Kaufman, 2001) would argue that intelligence needs to be understood in terms of commonalities, not differences. Of course, experimental psychologists have made the same claim for many decades, preferring to view individual differ- ences as noise in their data. Perhaps the best solution is some kind of synthesis, as recommended by Cronbach (1957). Jean Piaget, disheartened with his observations from work in Binet’s laboratory, provided a synthesis of sorts. He com- bined measurement with a more cognitive framework for understanding intelligence.
