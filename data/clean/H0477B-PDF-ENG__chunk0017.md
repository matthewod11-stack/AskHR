## recruitment and retention of talent.” Stories like a job candidate you

really wanted to hire turning you down because of your leave policy, or

someone talented leaving the organization because of a bad experience

with parental leave. “Those are the kind of stories that really ring with

leadership, and really highlight for them the market opportunity they

are missing.”

Bethell highlighted the story of one employee who had come back

to work at Walmart just one week after giving birth even though her

baby was in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). (According to

Department of Labor data, about one in four U.S. women return to

work within two weeks of giving birth.) She couldn’t afford not to work.

Employers hear that kind of story, says Bethell, and say to themselves,

“That’s not the kind of employer I want to be.”

A strong proposal. Bethell said employees who want better leave

policies should not stop at saying that the current policy is inadequate

— they should let their corporate decision-makers know exactly what

they want the new policy to be.
