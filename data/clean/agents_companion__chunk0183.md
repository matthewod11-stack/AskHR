# From agents to contractors

The common interface to define AI agents across various tools and platforms today is very

simple, and usually includes specifying the goal, some textual instructions, the tools that the

agent can use, and a set of examples. While this might be sufficient to prototype demos, it

leads to potentially underspecified definitions, and might be one of the leading reasons that

AI agents can struggle to get from prototype-to-production.

We propose to evolve the Agent interface to evolve them into ”Contract adhering agents”

which are aimed at solving complex tasks using AI Agents, more specifically in contexts

where stakes are high.
