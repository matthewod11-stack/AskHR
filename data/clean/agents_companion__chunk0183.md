- 1. Define the outcomes as precisely as possible, similarly to what we would do in a

real world scenario when agreeing on a service with a company we are contracting to

do something for us. This allows the agent (contractor) to validate against the desired

outcomes and iterate until the desired objective is achieved.

- 2. Make it possible to negotiate the task as well as clarifying and refining it, in order

to avoid any ambiguity in the definition, and fill any gap in common understanding of
