# Factorial Validity

One method of establishing validity of a scale is to administer the scale to different samples and to verify if the factor structure remains stable across these samples (Kerlinger, 1973). Thus, the expectation was that five factors similar to those of the first stage (Chelladurai & Saleh, 1978) would be extracted from the data of the second sample of physical education students and from the two versions of the scale administered to the athletes. Table 1 shows that the factor structure is very similar across the three analysesâ€”a finding which lends support to the suggestion that the factor structure is stable. The items and factors were also similar to those extracted in the earlier study (Chelladurai & Saleh, 1978).
