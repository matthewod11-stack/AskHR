## stairs and with a master bedroom on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

When Bill turned the decision over to his parents and pushed them to

make their expectations explicit, they were all able to see that it was

anxiety and stress that led them to focus on the single move.

William Shakespeare once wrote, “expectations are the root of all

heartache.” When we face a diﬃcult decision, we often unconsciously

set expectations — for ourselves and for others — about both

the decision-making process and the outcome. Embedded in our

expectations are our biases, which are always part of our thinking, so

can be very hard to bring to light.

The BIAS Framework breaks down what is knowable into its

components — our behavior, our information, our ability to think critically about our decisions, and the external forces aﬀecting the

decisions. This framework allows us to examine our expectations

and habits so that we may check and challenge bias, assumption,

and judgment to better engage with others and with our decisions.

Heartache is a part of life, but expectations don’t have to lead there.
