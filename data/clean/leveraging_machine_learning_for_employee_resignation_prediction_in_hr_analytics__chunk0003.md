Graph A(cid:2386)ention Networks (GATs) are well-adapted to perform the a(cid:2386)rition prediction task. In a GAT-based model, each employee is a node, and his/her relation or similarity with other employees is thegraph’sedge. (cid:2399)emodelemploysindividualemployeea(cid:2386)ributes like age, job satisfaction, and pay as node features. An employee- based adjacency matrix from employee similarities is utilized to create a graph with edges re(cid:2648)ecting the strength of the employee relationship.

In this regard, we introduce a GAT-based method for employee a(cid:2386)rition prediction. We aim to show GAT’s value and predictive power by proving that adding relational data can signi(cid:2647)cantly en- hance predictive performance compared to traditional methods. (cid:2399)e (cid:2647)ndings of our paper set the stage for a graph-based methodol- ogy to be adopted in human resource analytics. Not only does this
