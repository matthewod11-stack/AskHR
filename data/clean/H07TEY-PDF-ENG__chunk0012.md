Here’s what we found: let’s say that a ﬁrm sets the “right” salary when

they choose a salary that is in a narrow (5%) band of the median salary

for the same position, industry, and state. Prior to gaining access to

the benchmarking tool, there was an 11.6% probability that a ﬁrm sets

the “right” salary. After gaining access to the benchmarking tool, the

probability of setting the “right” salary increased two-fold, to 22.1%.

This is compelling evidence that these salary benchmarks are truly

inﬂuencing pay-setting, and causing position-level salaries to converge
