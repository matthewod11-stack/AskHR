Service delivery was increasingly provided by district- based psychologists. However, services through school and community clinics or research bureaus were common in large and medium-sized cities, and some rural areas were served through traveling clinics. In the latter model, services were provided by small teams of workers (e.g., a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and a social worker) traveling to small districts and providing evaluations, recommendations, and consulta- tion on a periodic basis. Such services lacked the continuity that could be provided by a district served by its own school psychologist. By the end of the period, as many as 500 school psychologists may have been employed in connection with the schools.
