Marriott has a well thought out proactive business plan for all new managers. This

approach realized that some managers have more management experience than others

however; the company will not assume that just because a person occupied a managerial

title in the past, they know the law. Also, some businesses have their own way of

conducting ordinary business issues and each newly hired employee needed to know the

approach of that business. Further, as a result of this on going intensive training, the

group improved on leadership abilities and was held accountable for their actions. In

addition, the number of complaints, violation or misunderstanding of the union contract,

decreased. This is a model approach to training managers, which can potentially lead to a

decrease in lawsuits filed by at-will employees. The mere fact that the training is on going

and recapitulated over time keeps all managers aware of company policies and the laws

that pertain to the business. Unfortunately, all businesses do not train their managers,

such nractices are nreventive measmes .

In regards to The Prudential Insurance Company of America, the author can only

speak on the division in which the author works. The Policyonwer Relation Department

was recently created for a temporary project ( class action lawsuit) with an undefined

completion date (which can not be determined by the company and or the courts). What

author does know, employees are promoted to a supervisor capacity, called team leaders

based on their past production, being the primary factory. Within this department,

everything is about production for front line employees, team leaders, associate managers

a.,d managers. Production is beii1g defined the ability to produce X amount of specified

work on average per hour, per day, per week. Those who are promoted to team leaders

are given no training and in some cases have no experience in management. Any advice

given to a team leader appears to be based off what needs to be accomplished, resulting

from a particular situation. The corporate objective is having business issues handled by

this department completed as fast as possible therefore, structured management training is

not provided. Such practices as these can cause harm to the organization in the long run.

Employees in this department range from undergraduate students,

junior college students,

graduate students, law school students, those taking a career break, persons in retirement

and those that have not attended college or involved in any career. Despite the fact that

this workforce is here because of schooling or career break does not mean, they will not

take action if they feel they were wrongful discharged. The company should run training

programs for all team leaders and recapitulate issues for associate manager who have also

had some or no management experience.

Below are steps m1y business can do, as preventive measures to protect thew.selves

and the business, should a case come to court or the Equal Employment Opportunity
