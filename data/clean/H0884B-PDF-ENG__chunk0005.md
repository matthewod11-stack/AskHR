# What the Research Shows

Research shows that people feel more pressured to agree to requests

than we realize, frequently agreeing to do things they would rather

not do, such as taking on burdensome, low-promotability work tasks,

allowing access to private digital information, and even engaging in

unethical acts. Simply by asking for something — particularly when we

are in a position of power — we can put someone on the spot because

people frequently ﬁnd it hard to say “no.”

To combat the pressure people feel to agree to requests, numerous

researchers and practitioners have proposed strategies that targets of

requests can use to say no. For example, targets have been counseled to

use self-aﬃrmations, refusal frames (e.g., saying “I don’t do X” instead

of “I can’t do X”), and “positive no’s,” or “yes, no, yes,” strategies to help

them say no to requests they would rather not agree to.

However, such interventions place the burden of saying no entirely

on the target of the request. Further, these interventions can be questionably eﬀective and impractical, often requiring targets to

come up with elaborate multi-part responses that are unrealistic to

implement when they’re put on the spot in the moment.
