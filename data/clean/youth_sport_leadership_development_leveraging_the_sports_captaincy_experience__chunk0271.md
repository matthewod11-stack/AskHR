introduce. One of the program components that coaches and athletic direc- tors particularly enjoy is that their athletes have an opportunity to meet their opponents, develop relationships with identiﬁed leaders in other schools, and foster peer collaboration.

In addition to the attendees, the MHSAA staff has also been very pleased with the program and its development. More speciﬁcally, they believe that CLTP not only exposes athletes to key principles of leadership, but that it also provides them with practical strategies for exercising more effective leadership skills both in and out of their sport environment.

While not its primary intent, CLTP has served as an excellent training tool for sport psychology graduate students in developing their understand- ing of the high school athlete and coaching population. Novice presenters have also been provided with a valuable mentorship experience by pairing with experienced facilitators. All presenters have been able to enhance their presentation, teaching, and rapport-building skills through the experience.

Finally, we have learned a great deal about developing leadership skills from conducting this program. It has also raised several questions that have led ISYS researchers to initiate a series of studies on youth sport leader- ship, including an examination of the high school captaincy experience and the perspective of coaches on developing leadership skills in high school athletes.
