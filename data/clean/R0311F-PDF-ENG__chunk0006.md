## by Christopher D. Ittner and David F. Larcker

In the past decade, increasing numbers of companies have been measuring customer loyalty, employee satisfaction, and other per- formance areas that are not financial but that they believe ultimately affect profitability. Doing so can offer several benefits. Managers can get a glimpse of the business’s progress well before a financial verdict is pronounced and the soundness of their investment alloca- tions has become moot. Employees can re- ceive better information on the specific ac- tions needed to achieve strategic objectives. And investors can have a better sense of the company’s overall performance, since nonfi- nancial indicators usually reflect realms of in- tangible value, such as R&D productivity, that accounting rules refuse to recognize as assets. But the reality is that only a few companies realize these benefits. Why? Because they fail to identify, analyze, and act on the right nonfi- nancial measures. We conducted field research in more than 60 manufacturing and service companies and supplemented it with survey responses from 297 senior executives. To our

surprise, we discovered that most companies have made little attempt to identify areas of nonfinancial performance that might advance their chosen strategy. Nor have they demon- strated a cause-and-effect link between im- provements in those nonfinancial areas and in cash flow, profit, or stock price.

Instead, many companies seem to have adopted boilerplate versions of nonfinancial measurement frameworks such as Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard, Accenture’s Per- formance Prism, or Skandia’s Intellectual Cap- ital Navigator. And yet the frameworks’ own inventors rightly insist that every company needs to dig deep to discover and track the ac- tivities that truly affect the frameworks’ broad domains (domains such as “financial,” “cus- tomers,” “internal business processes,” and “in- novation and learning,” in the case of the Bal- 1 anced Scorecard). But businesses often fail to establish such links partly out of laziness or thoughtlessness. As a result, self-serving man- agers are able to choose—and manipulate— measures solely for the purpose of making
