# Bezyak et al.

their concerns about the job performance of people with disabilities, followed by the need for more accurate and practical information to dispel preconceptions and concerns about hiring and retaining people with disabilities (Grizzard, 2005). In addition, a focus group study conducted by Kaye et al. (2011) identified the principal barriers to employing workers with disabilities are lack of awareness of disability and accommodation issues, concern over costs, and fear of legal liability.

Results from the current study are also consistent with a systematic review of the employer bias literature, which identified seven major employer biases against people with disabilities in the workplace (Amir et al., 2009). Bezyak and colleagues (2021) developed the Employers’ Stigmatizing Attitudes toward People with Disabilities Scale using these seven major employer biases as items and validated the measure in a sample of 140 HR managers. They found that employers’ disability biases were associated with negative attitudes toward disability, insignificant support of recruitment efforts, and lower willingness to hire people with disabilities. Findings of these explicit and implicit bias studies should be incorporated as contents in implicit bias and disability inclusion training for HR and other hiring managers and for onboarding of new employees to combat the negative effects of bias on individuals with disabilities in employment settings.
