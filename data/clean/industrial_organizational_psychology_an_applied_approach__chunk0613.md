reasonable chance of competing for applicants, even though they will often lose the best applicants to higher-paying organizations. Market position is most important in a good economy where jobs are plentiful and applicants have several job options. It may seem surprising that competing organizations would supply salary informa- tion to each other, but because every organization needs salary data from other organizations, compensation analysts tend to cooperate well with one another.

Roanoke County, Virginia, provides an excellent example of the importance of market position. Th e county was concerned about the high turnover rate of its police dispatchers and undertook a study to determine the reason for the problem. Possible reasons were thought to be working conditions, location, rep- utation, and pay. Th e study revealed that most of the turnover was due to a neigh- boring city paying its dispatchers $, more per year. Th is resulted in Roanoke County dispatchers resigning after a year of experience to take a higher-paying job only  miles away. Adjusting the salary greatly reduced the turnover rate.

Keep in mind that job evaluation concerns the worth of the job itself, not the worth of a person in the job. For example, suppose a salary survey reveals that the going rate for a job falls within the range of $, to $,, and an organization, deciding to be at the upper end of the market, sets its range for the position at $, to $,. Decisions must then be made regarding where in the $, range each particular employee will be paid. Th is decision is based on such factors as years of experience, years with the company, special skills, educa- tion, local cost of living, and performance level.

We have earlier discussed the amount of money a job is worth: this amount is called direct compensation. Employees are also compensated in other ways, such as pay for time not worked (e.g., holidays, vacation, sick days), deferred income (e.g., Social Security and pension plans), health protection such as medi- cal and dental insurance, and perquisites (“perks”) such as a company car (Mar- tocchio, ). Consequently, a job with a direct compensation of $, might actually be worth more than one at $, because of the indirect compensa- tion package. In fact, any time your author complains to his neighbors about low
