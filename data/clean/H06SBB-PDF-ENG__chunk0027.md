# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

ADI IGNATIUS: So is your guess that COVID and our response to it has

permanently changed how we collaborate and how we interact, or that

we will eventually get back to something we were familiar with?

SANDY SPEICHER: I would say that it’s permanently changed

something for us. I don’t think that necessarily means that what we’re

doing right now is what we’re going to be doing forever, but I think

what has permanently changed is this societal scale consciousness, this

recognition of the larger systems that we live and work within. And

really, I think that now business leaders and employees and everyone

are asking questions about the role that business can play in helping

the world be a better place. How do we rebalance a lot of the social

injustices that we’ve become quite conscious of? How do we create a

new relationship with the planet that’s not extractive, but generative?

These are questions that leaders are starting to ask that employees are

now demanding that leaders ask, and I think that this has been in us for

a long time, the belief that the way we’re working isn’t quite working

and these two years have really helped us see a lot of those dimensions

and realize that we can change things.

And that’s happening at a pretty big scale. I think that we’re all

designing our way toward that now. But I do think that some of our

clients, for instance, are asking super interesting questions. We have

some work we’re doing with multiple companies right now around, for

instance, how do we increase the voice of the frontline worker in the

decisions that are made about technology to support their work? Now,

it’s really common that there’s a tech team that sits in the background

of big companies and makes a lot of decisions for what tools workers

should use. And it’s rare, actually, that frontline workers are seen as not

just a customer in that, but a potential designer of that. But yet, they’re

the ones that know the needs. And so how do we actually build our

organizations to be that collaborative, to not have that much distance
