between the decisions that are being made and the people who have the

real direct lived experience?

ADI IGNATIUS: I’m going to go to a couple audience questions now,

because we’re getting a lot of them and some of them are quite

interesting. So this one might be out of your purview, but I’m going to

try it anyways. This is from Vance who’s in Chicago who’s asking about

the metaverse. We’ve been talking about designing systems, physical

systems to improve how we do things and then there’s this parallel,

virtual environment called the metaverse. So the question is how do you

see the metaverse playing a role in the future of work?

SANDY SPEICHER: Hi, Vance, thanks for your question. And while it’s

a very prescient question, I think this is one of the creative pathways we

have for the future. I guess when I think about the metaverse, it feels

like another environment for us to build a world, right? For us to build

how we relate to each other, what rituals we run ourselves by, what

agreements we run ourselves by. And actually, that to me is the same set

of underpinnings that we need in the real world, right? That we need in

our workplaces, that we need in our virtual work environments.

So this idea of world building feels like something for us to all become

really aware of, not just to jump into another technology tool or another

platform or another environment, but to really be thinking of what

world are we building? We can all become very aware of that and very

intentional about that and set what kinds of agreements we want to

govern our relationships, what kind of work we can do here that we

want to do here, how we make sure that we’re deepening relationships,

not just transacting.
