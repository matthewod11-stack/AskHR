ABSTRACT:

Organizational culture and climate are critical factors that shape the overall dynamics and effectiveness of a workplace. Organizational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, and norms that define the character of an organization. It influences how employees interact with one another, make decisions, and approach their work. A positive organizational culture can foster creativity, teamwork, and employee engagement, while a negative culture can lead to conflict and low morale. On the other hand, organizational climate relates to the current atmosphere and perceptions within the organization. It reflects employees' feelings about their work environment, leadership, and the organization's overall health. A healthy climate typically aligns with a positive culture, but it also encompasses day-to-day experiences and can change more rapidly. Together, culture and climate play a pivotal role in shaping an organization's success, affecting employee satisfaction, retention, and performance. Therefore, organizations must actively manage and nurture their culture and climate to create a harmonious and productive work environment that aligns with their strategic objectives.
