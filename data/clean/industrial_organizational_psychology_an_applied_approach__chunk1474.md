# Adverse Impact

The first step in determining a test’s potential bias is finding out whether it will result in adverse impact. There are two basic ways to determine this: looking at test results or anticipating adverse impact prior to the test. As mentioned in Chapter , adverse impact occurs if the selection rate for any group is less than % of the highest scoring group (practical significance) and the difference is sta- tistically significant (statistical significance).

Though determining the adverse impact of a test seems simple—which is done by comparing the hiring rates (hires ÷ applicants) of two groups—the actual nuts and bolts of the calculations can get complicated, and it is common that plaintiffs and defendants disagree on who is considered an “applicant” and who is considered a “hire.” For example, as shown in Table ., if a person applying for a job does not meet the minimum qualifications, he is not considered as an applicant in adverse impact calculations. For example, if a plumber applies for a job as a brain surgeon, he clearly lacks the minimum qualifications for the job—a medical degree.

There are three criteria for a minimum qualification: it must be needed to perform the job, and not merely be a preference; it must be formally identified and communicated prior to the start of the selection process; and it must be con- sistently applied. As you can imagine, with such criteria, there is much room for disagreement. Your CD-ROM contains data that you can use to compute adverse impact and determine who is an applicant and who should be counted as a hire/ offer.

Remember that a legal defense for adverse impact is job relatedness and that a valid test is a job-related test. Thus, even if the test has adverse impact, it probably will be considered a legal test.

But even though the test might be considered valid, an organization still might not want to use it. If a test results in adverse impact, the organization may have to go to court to defend itself. Even though a valid test will probably allow the organization to win the case, going to court is expensive. Thus, if the utility of the test is low, potential court costs will outweigh the minimal savings to the organization. Furthermore, a test with adverse impact will lead to poor public relations with minority communities, which could hurt recruitment or marketing efforts by the organization.

Using the % rule to determine a test’s fairness means that an organization must wait until it has used the test to select employees, at which time damage
