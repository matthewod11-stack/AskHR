Methods Participants Participants were recruited across three major health care systems and one university student health center from a Mid-Western state in America. The first health system, a major university medical training facility comprises a network of two hospitals and 40 clinics. The second health system, is a state-run network of over 30 major hospitals and clinics. The third, is a re- gional faith-based network of 14 hospitals and over 400 clinics. The university student health center provides a range of medical services on a major university campus. Combined, the three health systems and university stu- dent health center, operate the majority of medical facilities in the state.
