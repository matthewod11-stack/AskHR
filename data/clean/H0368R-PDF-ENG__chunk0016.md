## The ﬁgure below shows that this immigrant share of entrepreneurship

has been increasing dramatically since the mid-1990s, when the

immigrant share of founders was closer to 17%. This rise in immigrant

contributions to entrepreneurship is sharper than the rise in the

immigrant share of all employees in new ﬁrms. You can also see that, in

total, 35%-40% of new ﬁrms have at least one immigrant entrepreneur

connected to the ﬁrm’s creation.
