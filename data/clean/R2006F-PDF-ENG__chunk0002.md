Apple is well-known for its innovations in hardware, software, and

services. Thanks to them, it grew from some 8,000 employees and

$7 billion in revenue in 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned, to 137,000

employees and $260 billion in revenue in 2019. Much less well-known

are the organizational design and the associated leadership model that

have played a crucial role in the company’s innovation success.
