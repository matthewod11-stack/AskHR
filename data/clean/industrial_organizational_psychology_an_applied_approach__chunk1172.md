in six months; but the company perceived a problem because a few key work- ers had missed many days of work. Thus, using biodata (or any other selection device) to predict a nonrelevant criterion would not have saved the organiza- tion any money.

Once a criterion has been chosen, employees are split into two criterion groups based on their criterion scores. For example, if tenure is selected as the criterion measure, employees who have worked for the company for at least one year might be placed in the “long tenure” group, whereas workers who quit or were fired in less than one year would be placed in the “short tenure” group. If enough employees are available, the upper and lower % of performers can be used to establish the two groups (Hogan, ).

Once employee data have been obtained and the criterion and criterion groups chosen, each piece of employee information is compared with criterion group membership. The purpose of this stage is to determine which pieces of information will distinguish the members of the high criterion group from those in the low criterion group. Traditionally, the vertical percentage method has been used to do this. Percentages are calculated for each group on each item. The percentage of a particular response for the low group is subtracted from the per- centage of the same response in the high group to obtain a weight for that item. An example of this weighting process is shown in Table .. It is important to ensure that the weights make rational sense. Items that make sense are more face valid and thus easier to defend in court than items that are empirically valid but don’t make rational sense (Stokes & Toth, ).

Once weights have been assigned to the items, the information is weighted and then summed to form a composite score for each employee. Composite scores are then correlated with the criterion to determine whether the newly created biodata instrument will significantly predict the criterion. Although this proce- dure sounds complicated, it actually is fairly easy although time- consuming.
