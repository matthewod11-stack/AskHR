Summary of Cognitive Mechanisms A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanisms that underlie a person’s experience of humor or amusement; i.e., what makes something funny? However, incongruity theory appears to have outlasted other theories. We believe that this is due to the ability of the theory to accommodate the predictions of other theories (Davis, 1993), as well as empirical evidence from cognitive and physiological studies such as those described above. Incongruity theory suggests that humor is elicited when two contrasting expectation systems are elicited within a given humor stimulus (e.g., a joke), but the incongruity between them is subsequently resolved. In addition, more recent development of the theory by Wyer and Collins (1992) (i.e., principles of non-replacement, diminishment, comprehension difﬁculty, cognitive elaboration, and information-processing motivations) helps to account for even more humor phenomena, and will be particularly useful when we describe the possible moderating impact of culture on the link it is between humor and important organizational phenomena. Finally, important to note that evidence from a number of empirical studies seems to indicate that the cognitive mechanisms underlying the perception of humor, incongruity in particular, are universal across cultures (Alden, Hoyer, & Lee, 1993; Shultz, 1976; Vuorela, 2005). This point becomes more relevant when we examine the inﬂuence of culture on the effects of humor.
