# THE EARLY SCIENTIFIC PERIOD

Contemporarycognitivescientistsdistinguishbetweenproce- dural and declarative learning, sometimes known as knowing how and knowing that (Squire, 1994). Although the distinc- tion was drawn only recently, it will be useful for understand- ing the study of cognition and learning in the Early ScientiÔ¨Åc Period. A paradigmatic illustration of the two forms of learn- ing or knowing is bicycle riding. Most of us know how to ride a bicycle (procedural learning), but few of us know the physi- cal and physiological principles that are involved (declarative learning).
