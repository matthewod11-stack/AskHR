Some 34 per cent train all staff, however, a greater proportion of all staff in the public sector (49 per cent) are likely to receive training (CIPD, 2005).

In the IRS study (Wolff, 2005) Virgin Mobile reported good training of appraisers and appraisees was key to making its appraisal system succeed, along with positive communication to ‘pitch it as a benefit’. The Student Loans Company also commented that ‘training of managers in carrying out appraisals is essential to the success of appraisal systems’.
