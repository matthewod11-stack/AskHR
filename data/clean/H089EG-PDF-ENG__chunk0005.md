# Illustration by Pierre Buttin

Tom, a client of mine, started our coaching session by placing his

three-page to-do list on the table between us. As a new leader in the

organization, he felt both excited about his role and overwhelmed by

the responsibilities he was now expected to take on. As we began to

review his long list of tasks, I asked, “Is there anyone you can hand a few

of these responsibilities oﬀ to?”

Tom paused. “These are all tasks that only I can do,” he said. “I’m really

good at them.”
