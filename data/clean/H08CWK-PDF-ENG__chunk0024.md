# emotions eﬀectively.

Pay attention to what triggers your feelings and how they aﬀect your

thoughts and actions. When you encounter strong emotions, take a

moment to pause and reﬂect. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider

what the emotion is signaling and how it relates to the situation at hand.

Shift your focus from the emotional turmoil (the noise) to the insights

within the experience (the signal). Ask yourself what went wrong, what

could be improved, and what insights can be learned.
