Mandatory arbitration is all the rage today in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street. That’s because it does the best job of protecting companies from litigation.

Here’s how the USPS system works:

After an accuser has filed her (or his) complaint and submitted a request for mediation, the accused is required to come to an initial meeting with the mediator, who in some cases is joined by a union rep as co-mediator. Participation is entirely voluntary for the accuser, and the accused may opt out of mediation after that first meeting. Mediation ses- sions are scheduled within two to three weeks and typically last three or four hours. Most participants feel good about how these sessions are conducted. The USPS has done exit surveys of all partici- pants without breaking out accused and accusers, on the dispute-resolution prin- ciple that no party is on trial. They show that more than 90% of respondents are satisfied with their mediator’s impar- tiality and with how they were treated during the process, and at least 60% are satisfied with the outcome. This alterna- tive system led to a four-year decline of more than 30% in formal discrimination and harassment filings.
