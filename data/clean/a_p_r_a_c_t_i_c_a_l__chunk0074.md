# Manager (agents as tools)

A central “manager” agent coordinates multiple specialized agents via tool calls, each handling a speci(cid:19)c task or domain.

Decentralized (agents handing oT to agents)

Multiple agents operate as peers, handing os tasks to one another based on their specializations.

Multi-agent systems can be modeled as graphs, with agents represented as nodes. In the manager pattern, edges represent tool calls whereas in the decentralized pattern, edges represent handoss that transfer execution between agents(cid:143)

Regardless of the orchestration pattern, the same principles apply: keep components (cid:17)exible, composable, and driven by clear, well-structured prompts.
