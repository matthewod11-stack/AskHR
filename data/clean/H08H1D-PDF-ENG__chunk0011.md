## HBR / Digital Article / How to Lead When the Future Feels Unpredictable

What do you value?

If you allow yourself to step back from the immediate challenges,

liminal periods can remind you of what you value most. The events

that have thrust you into this phase, and your feelings about them,

are indicators of what truly matters to you. When you ﬁnd yourself

angry about a situation, for example, it’s probably because something

(or someone) has transgressed in territory that you care deeply about.

So consider this moment an opportunity to acknowledge and aﬃrm

your values, and indeed to understand more about yourself. A liminal

experience gives you a chance to question your own assumptions

about the way the world is and should be, and to ask whether those

assumptions are still serving you.

Where do we stand?

For some leaders, especially those who have a bias for action,

introspection may feel suspiciously like navel-gazing. But introspection

and reﬂection are vital for leaders in liminal times. Colleagues will be

looking to you to supply reassurance and clarity — a job that can be

particularly challenging if views within your organization are polarized.

So leaders need to look inward and ﬁgure out what they and their

organization stand for. Only then will they possess enough conﬁdence

and clarity about their purpose to help their colleagues identify

common ground and negotiate the liminal period together.

How can we move ahead?

People tend to adapt to prolonged liminality by withdrawing into

helplessness or lapsing into cynicism. But that’s a tendency leaders

need to ﬁght against, because getting “stuck” in a liminal experience

serves nobody well. Although they are often unsettling, these

experiences also represent an opportunity to experiment and challenge
