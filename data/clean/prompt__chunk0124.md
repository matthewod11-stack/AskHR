## Table 2. An example of few-shot prompting

When you choose examples for your prompt, use examples that are relevant to the task you

want to pe(cid:455)orm. The examples should be diverse, of high quality, and well wri(cid:459)en. One small

mistake can confuse the model and will result in undesired output.

If you are trying to generate output that is robust to a variety of inputs, then it is impo(cid:457)ant to

include edge cases in your examples. Edge cases are inputs that are unusual or unexpected,

but that the model should still be able to handle.
