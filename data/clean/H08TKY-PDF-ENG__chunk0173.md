## breakdowns in communication, and limited accountability for results

all drag down performance.

- Performance bottlenecks are often invisible to top management.

- The persistence of the gap fosters a culture of underperformance.

There are, however, companies that have Ô¨Ågured out how to close

this gap. They do so by: 1) making strategy simple and concrete; 2)

debating assumptions, not forecasts; 3) using a rigorous framework

with a common language; 4) discussing resource deployments early; 5)

clearly identifying priorities; 6) continuously monitoring performance;

and 7) rewarding and developing execution capabilities.
