- 3. Research methodology

Management research deals fundamentally with the creation and legitimation of various forms of knowledge associated with management practices. Traditional approaches to management research involve a varied combination of key processes, observation, reflection, theoretical conjunctures and testing of theories and hypotheses, creation and development of models to acquire the essence of management realities (Partington, 2002).

The present study is based on qualitative research methods, which is a form of social action that emphasizes the way people interpret and give meaning to their experiences in order to understand the social reality of individuals and organizations. Qualitative research uses interviews, journals, articles and observations to obtain, analyze, and interpret the data content analysis of visual and textual materials (Mohajan, 2018). Qualitative research is exploratory and seeks to explain “how” and “why” a certain phenomenon works as it happens in a certain context (Mohajan, 2018).

The roots of qualitative research are found in social and cultural anthropology, philosophy, psychology, history and sociology. The purpose of qualitative research is to systematically describe and interpret problems or phenomena from the point of view of the individual or population studied and to generate new concepts and theories (Mohajan, 2018).

In this respect, the present study analyzes the concepts of change in organizations and resistance to change. Thus, we tried to highlight the aspects of organizational change, the forces that generate change, types of change, change management, resistance to change, techniques for reducing resistance to change and change readiness.

Therefore, the present study has the following specific objectives:

- To provide a theoretical foundation, based on the study of the literature, of the concepts of change in organizations, change management, resistance to change and change readiness.

- To provide sufficient information to understand change in organizations and resistance to change.
