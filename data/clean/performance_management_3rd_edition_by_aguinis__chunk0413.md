## Six Recommended Steps for Conducting Productive Performance Reviews

- 1. Identify what the employee has done well and poorly by citing specific positive and negative behaviors.

- 2. Solicit feedback from your employee about these behaviors. Listen for reactions and explanations.

- 3. Discuss the implications of changing, or not changing, the behaviors. Positive feedback is best, but an employee must be made aware of what will happen if any poor performance continues. 4. Explain to the employee how skills used in past achievements can help him overcome any current performance problems.

- 5. Agree on an action plan. Encourage the employee to invest in improving his performance by asking questions such as “What ideas do you have for ______?” and “What suggestions do you have for ______?”

- 6. Set up a meeting to follow up and agree on the behaviors, actions, and attitudes to be evaluated.

about performance will be helpful to both of us. Let’s go through this process step by step. First, I would like you to tell me about your own views about your performance during the past year. Specifically, please share with me the things you believe you did particularly well and areas in which you think you may have been able to do better. As a second step, I will tell you about the performance evaluation I prepared. As a third step, we will talk about the issues on which you and I agree. As a fourth step, we can talk about issues for which we may have different perspectives. I will explain the reasoning behind my views and I want to hear the reasoning behind yours. In terms of my evaluation of your work, I want to first make sure we agree on the specific goals and objectives of your job. Then, we will talk about the results you achieved this year and the section on the evaluation form about job skills and competencies. After we talk about that, I will tell you what my overall rating is and why I believe this is an appropriate score. Ok, let’s go ahead and start. Please tell me about how things went this past year.

We discuss performance reviews in more detail in Chapter 9. For now, however, consider the centrality of the performance review stage in the performance manage- ment process by reading the box “Six Recommended Steps for Conducting Productive Performance Reviews.”26
