## George Mason University professor Sarah Wittman calls these “lingering

identities,” or old identities that persist rather than adapt to how we’re

changing. Wittman shares that as we grow or change, our identity

transitions are often invisible — unless we do the work to help others

see our changes.

While some research suggests that it can take as long as six years

to shift these lingering ﬁrst (or early) impressions, in our experience,

it’s possible to change how others see you and reset the company

narrative about your contributions. Our clients have successfully used

the following steps to increase their inﬂuence, change their leadership

brand, and reposition themselves internally to better match the leader

they are today.
