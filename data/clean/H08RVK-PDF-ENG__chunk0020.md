# a ﬁrst for him in years.

If you ﬁnd yourself tethered to your phone or smart watch, create rules about when you can oﬃcially turn oﬀ. It could be that from when

you log oﬀ before dinner until your kids go down to bed that you’re

disconnected with work. Or you have “no email” weekends, where you

don’t check your work inbox and only emergencies can reach you via

text. The exact times and rules can vary, but the important point is that

you create a space where you and the people around you know that they

have your full attention.
