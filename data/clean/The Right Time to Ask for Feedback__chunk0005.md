title: The Right Time to Ask for Feedback
---
# In one study, scientists

discovered that people who soughtfeedback on a completed speech or draft were primarily lookingfor affirmation of their work. As a result, the constructivefeedback they were given was less impactful — and this could befor a number of reasons. When we’re told to make a big changeafter finishing a project, we may feel anxious because the deadlineis approaching. Similarly, if the feedback is to make severalsmaller changes, we may tell ourselves the feedback-giver is nit-picky to save our egos. Our instinct, in both situations, maybe topush back. Instinctually, we may defend ourselves, even when weknow the other person is right.
