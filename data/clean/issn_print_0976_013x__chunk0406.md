the fury of Gautam today, he knew what was in store for him during the forthcoming month.

He had attended hundreds of sales meetings in his brief stint as Sales Executive in three

organizations so far. Yet, he never experienced such a venomous attitude of a senior manager

towards his team members. Himself a star sales professional, Mithun never faced any

unpleasant remarks from his bosses. All the three sales managers under whom Mithun got

rigorous training earlier, were quite polite, compassionate, empathetic, and accommodating.

Hence the team members usually went out of their way to attain the set objectives. On several

occasions when the team member faltered, manager came forward to support and guide him.

Mithun became apprehensive about his own performance in the new organization. He was

filled with self-doubt about the decision to join MyBank. Now he understood why the sales

team at Kharagpur branch of MyBank were so prickly. There was hardly any camaraderie in

Now he had two options â€“either he would move on to yet another organization or approach

the corporate HR for interventions. Mithun chose the latter. He shot an e-mail to Raman

Bagchi, the HR Head of MyBank, requesting him to take corrective measures before it was too

late. Mithun had little idea about how his e-mail would be taken up. But he was pleasantly

surprised to know that an inquiry into the conduct of Gautam Sarkar was initiated, and he

was suspended for the time being. Moreover, Raman had also constituted a committee to

suggest action plan for improving the organizational culture and climate at MyBank. Mithun

was the youngest member in the committee. News of his induction in the committee was
