# Conﬂuence of Dynamic Forces

indexes of I-O textbooks and specialized I-O books reveals the vast number of contributors. Presidents of organized I-O psychology (APA Division 14 and SIOP) are elected be- causeoftheirsigniﬁcantcontributions,whicharedescribedin their autobiographies available on the SIOP Web site (www. siop.org). SIOP members are given the distinction of fellow because of their outstanding contributions to the discipline. SIOPawards are named after inﬂuential individuals (Koppes, 1999), and award recipients are recognized for their contribu- tions. Other contributors are recognized in biographies and obituaries, which are published in TIP. In addition to individ- ualaccomplishments,I-Opsychologistscreatedwaystowork together. For example, many I-O psychologists formed pro- fessional groups, such as the Dearborn Conference Group (Meyer, 1997) and the No-Name Group (Benjamin, 1997), to address concerns, discuss issues, and share research. I-O psy- chologists have also established consulting ﬁrms, which pro- vide for collaborations between individuals and subsequent developments in research and practice (e.g., Center for Cre- ative Leadership, Development Dimensions International, Jeanneret and Associates, Inc., Personnel Research Associ- ates, Inc., Personnel Decisions Research Institute).

An indicator of developments in the ﬁeld is the number of periodicals, books, and other sources that contain I-O-related research and applications. In addition to the resources men- tioned in this chapter, over 25 different journals were formed, handbooks on related topics were created (e.g., Lorsch, 1987), two annual series were generated (e.g., Research in Organiza- tional Behavior and Research in Personnel and Human Re- source Management), and two series were established by SIOP to publish cutting-edge research and applications: Organizational Frontiers of Industrial and Organizational Psychology and The Professional Practice Series.

Numerous advances have been observed within the disci- pline. Katzell and Austin (1992) and Katzell (1994) identiﬁed metatrends such as the predominant use of sophisticated statistical analyses (e.g., structural equation modeling, meta- analysis) and more attention to outcomes not directly linked to the bottom line (e.g., stress and career development). Dunnette (1998) recognized accomplishments in his recent review of trends and emerging issues in I-O psychology:

Most signiﬁcant has been an increasingly fruitful blending of as- pects of the science and practice of this ﬁeld. Special attention has been directed towards systematic study of issues related to fair employment practices, and to broader recognition of the im- portance of meta-analysis for advancing knowledge as opposed to such simplistic approaches as statistical signiﬁcance testing. Increased attention has been focused on the importance of ge- netic inﬂuences in areas of work behaviour. . . . Several important
