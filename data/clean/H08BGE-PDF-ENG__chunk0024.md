# Equitable work

Nonparents are often expected to “pick up the slack” for colleagues

who are out for parental leave or caregiving. Instead of dumping extra

work on these coworkers, consider how you can build coverage into

jobs. Ensure you have enough employees to cover short-term absences.

You can also use temporary workers to cover for people who are out,

oﬀer current workers overtime or a stipend to take on the additional

work, or hire an interim backﬁll when a person is on a prolonged

leave. If you must have an existing employee step in, compensate them

appropriately if they are taking on higher-level work and release them
