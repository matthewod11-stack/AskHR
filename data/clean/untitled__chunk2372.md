# Overview

The historical origins of school psychology from both psy- chology and education were clearly observable in the struc- ture of the ﬁeld by the end of the Hybrid Years. Two separate associations were now representing school psychologists at the national level. Separate state-level organizations afﬁliated withtheNASPwereestablished,whereasthestatepsycholog- ical associations afﬁliated with the APA. School psychology

had achieved a literature distinct from mainstream psychol- ogy’s literature, reﬂecting its need to have information and an identity that focused on psychological applications to schools and the problems of schooling.

Training programs were developing in psychology depart- ments in colleges of arts and sciences but more rapidly in var- ious departments of colleges of education. To the extent that program accreditation was discernible, it was emerging at the doctoral level from the APA and at the master’s and doctoral levels from the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). Two systems of credentialing in school psychology were in place, one regulated by state departments of education and the other by state boards of examiners in psychology.

The prototypical developments of the early Hybrid Years had evolved into a distinct structure of school psychology by the end of the period. This structure would grow in strength and complexity during the Thoroughbred Years, but the two worlds of school psychology (education and psychology) and the two levels of training, titles, and practice would haunt the ﬁeld for the remainder of the century and into the next.

THE THOROUGHBRED YEARS (1970–PRESENT)

The past 30 years of school psychology’s development are characterized by strengthened identity, consolidation of na- tional and state-level organizations, and acquisition of the symbols of full professionalization. Signiﬁcant inﬂuencing factors include external and internal regulation of training and practice. Among the most inﬂuential has been the enact- ment of federal legislation regarding the management of in- formation and the rights of persons with disabilities. Public Law 93-380, the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, substantially changed the manner in which public and private agencies collected, maintained, and disseminated information, including school psychological records. Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, mandated a special education in the least restrictive environment, including psychological services for all eligible children of school age. Subsequent amendments to this law broadened the age range of eligible children and the cate- gories of special education. The most recent amendment was Public Law 105-17, the Individuals with Disabilities Educa- tion Act of 1997. These laws and their subsequent national and state-level regulations reﬂected a growing inﬂuence of the federal government in public education, an arena previ- ously left largely up to state and local governments. The rip- ple effect of such external regulation on school psychology is observable in the content of training curricula, credentialing
