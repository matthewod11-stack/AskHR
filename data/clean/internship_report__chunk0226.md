# X. ML (Medical Leave)

Medical Leave entitlement shall not be exceeding 14 (fourteen) working days in a calendar year

(January to December) for all employees. If for any reason any staff member who has been

granted advance leave beyond pro-rata entitlement leaves the group before completion of a full

year, the administration will have the discretion to adjust such excess ML availed of against un-

availed CL or EL, if any. In the event of non-availability of any CL or EL to his/her credit,

deduction from salary will be made for such ML enjoyed beyond the entitlement. Medical Leave

application even for 03 (three) working day must be supported by a Medical Certificate from a

registered doctor. In case of absence due to sickness employee must inform Human

Resources/Admin Department regarding inability to attend office.
