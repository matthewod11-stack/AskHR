surrounding performance during the review period, including a tough economy, the introduction of a new line of products, and so forth.

- Competencies and indicators.

If the organization adopts a behavior approach, this section of the form includes a definition of the various competencies to be assessed, together with their behavioral indicators.

- Major achievements and contributions. Some forms include a section in which a rater is asked to list the two or three major accomplishments of the individual being rated during the review period. These could refer to results, behaviors, or both.

- Developmental achievements. This section of the form includes information about the extent to which the developmental goals set for the review period have been achieved. This can include a summary of activities, such as work- shops attended and courses taken as well as results, such as new skills learned. Evidence of having learned new skills can be documented, for example, by obtaining a professional certification. Although some organizations include developmental achievements in the appraisal form, others choose to include them in a separate form. Sun Microsystems is an example of an organization that separates these forms. Some organizations do not include development content as part of the appraisal form because it is often difficult for employees to focus constructively on development if they have received a less-than-ideal performance review.

- Developmental needs, plans, and goals. This section of the form is future oriented and includes information about specific goals and timetables in terms of employee development. As noted before, some organizations choose to create a separate development form and do not include this information as part of the perform- ance appraisal form.

- Stakeholder input. Some forms include sections to be filled out by other stakehold- ers, such as customers with whom the employee interacts. Overall, stakeholders are defined as people who have firsthand knowledge of and are affected by the employee’s performance. In most cases, input from other stakeholders is collected from them by using forms separate from the main appraisal because not all sources of performance information are in the position to rate the same perform- ance dimensions. For example, an employee may be rated on the competency “teamwork” by peers and on the competency “reliability” by a customer. A more detailed discussion of the use of various sources of performance information is offered later in this chapter.

- Employee comments. This section includes reactions and comments provided by the employee being rated. In addition to allowing formal employee input, which improves the perceived fairness of the system, the inclusion of this section helps with legal issues because it documents that the employee has had an opportunity to participate in the evaluation process.

- Signatures. The final section of most forms includes a section in which the employee being rated, the rater, and the rater’s supervisor provide their signatures to show they have seen and discussed the content of the form. The HR department may also provide approval of the content of the form. Table 6.1 summarizes the major components of appraisal forms. Let’s consider

some examples to see which of these components are present in each.
