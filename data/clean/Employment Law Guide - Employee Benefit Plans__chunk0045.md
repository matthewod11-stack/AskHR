# enrollment in the plan.

Michelle's Law, passed in 2008, prohibits group health plans from terminating coverage for a dependent child

who has lost student status as a result of a medically necessary leave of absence. Plans must continue to

provide coverage for up to one year, or until coverage would otherwise terminate under the plan. Plans are allowed to require physician certiÔ¨Åcation of the medical necessity for the leave of absence.

The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) requires group health plans

and group health insurance issuers to permit an employee or dependent that is eligible for but not enrolled in

the plan to enroll when the employee or dependent is covered under Medicaid or CHIP and loses that

coverage as a result of loss of eligibility or when the employee or dependent becomes eligible for Medicaid or CHIP assistance with respect to coverage under the group health plan. CHIPRA also created new notice

requirements related to these special enrollment rights.
