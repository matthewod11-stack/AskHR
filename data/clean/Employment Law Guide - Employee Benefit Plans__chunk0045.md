# Employee Rights

The Act grants employees several important rights. Among them are the right to receive information about their pension or health beneﬁt plans, to participate in timely and fair processes for beneﬁt claims, to elect to

temporarily continue group health coverage after losing coverage, to receive certiﬁcates verifying health

coverage under a plan, and to recover beneﬁts due under the plan.
