## Chapter 8 • Performance Management and Employee Development

between a senior (mentor) and junior (protégé) employee. For such programs to be successful, it is best to allow the mentor and protégé to choose each other rather than arbitrarily assigning who will be mentoring whom. In general, mentors serve as role models and teach protégés what it takes to succeed in the organization. In more specific terms, mentors can help protégés gain targeted skills.

- Attending a conference. Another way to acquire required knowledge and skills is to sponsor an employee’s attendance at a conference or trade show. It is useful to require that the employee provide a written report or even deliver a presentation upon returning from the conference. In this way, it is easier to assess what has been learned and, in addition, the knowledge gained can be shared with other organizational members.

- Getting a degree. Some organizations provide tuition reimbursement benefits for their employees to obtain additional degrees or certifications. For example, the organization can sponsor an employee’s MBA program or an employee’s taking a course with the goal of earning a certification designation (e.g., Certified Novell Administrator, Professional in Human Resources). In most cases, employees commit to continuing the relationship with their employer for a prespecified amount of time after completing the degree. If the employee leaves the organization before this time frame, he may have to reimburse the organization for the cost of his education.

- Job rotation. Another way to gain necessary skills is to be assigned to a different job on a temporary basis. This is the model followed in the medical profession in which residents have to rotate across specialty areas for several months (e.g., OB-GYN, psychiatry, pediatrics). For example, residents may be required to rotate across the various emergency medicine services for a 19-month period.

- Temporary assignments. Aless systematic rotation system includes the opportunity to work on a challenging temporary assignment. This allows employees to gain specific skills within a limited time frame.

- Membership or leadership role in professional or trade organizations. Some employers sponsor membership in professional or trade organizations. Such an organization dis- tributes publications to its members and holds informal and formal meetings in which employees have an opportunity to learn about best practices and other useful information for their jobs. For example, this could include the Society for Human Resource Management (www.shrm.org) or the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (http://www.cipd.co.uk/) for human resources (HR) professionals. Also, presentation, communication, planning, and other skills can be learned while serving in a leadership role in a volunteer organization outside of work.

Table 8.1 includes a summarized list of developmental activities that may be avail- able to achieve goals included in a developmental plan. Based on your own preferences and learning style, which of these activities do you believe would be most beneficial to you? Please rank these activities in terms of your preference.

An example of a developmental plan is included in Figure 8.1. The developmental plan can be part of the appraisal form, or it can be included in a separate form. The form included in Figure 8.1 shows that employees have several choices in terms of develop- mental activities. Note that the form includes space so that information can be inserted regarding what activities will take place when, what the objectives are, and whether the objective has been met or not.
