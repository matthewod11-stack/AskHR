## Career Development Through the Whole-Life Lens

A common theme in the contemporary career literature is that whole-life considerations (i.e., those stemming from both the work and the home domains) are a major driver of career decision making. In addition to the desire for upward mobility (i.e., promotions), the inability to balance one’s nonwork responsibilities and the consideration of personal circumstances act as key antecedents to interorgani- zational mobility (Clarke, 2013; Sullivan & Mainiero, 2007). We contend that whether one’s career is largely intra- or interorganizational depends on the available opportunities for creating whole-life balance.
