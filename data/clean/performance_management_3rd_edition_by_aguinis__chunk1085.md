## Chapter 6 • Gathering Performance Information

within her unit, and communicating that performance management is a key part of a supervisor’s job. Also, supervisors need to have tools available to make their job of providing accurate ratings and feedback easier. This includes training on, for example, how to conduct the appraisal interview so that supervisors are able to provide both positive and negative feedback and are skilled at conveying both positive and, negative news regarding performance.

In addition to conscious and intentional errors in the rating process, raters are likely to make unintended errors. Observing information about performance, storing this information in memory, and then recalling it when it is time to fill out the appraisal form is a complex task. This task becomes more complex with more complex jobs that include several unrelated performance dimensions. Because of the cognitive complexity of the performance evaluation process, raters are likely to make not only intentional but also unintentional errors in evaluating performance. These errors are discussed in detail in Chapter 7. To a large extent, these errors can be minimized by improving the skills of those responsible for providing performance evaluations. These training programs, which target mostly supervisors, are discussed next.
