# Call to Action:

The future of AI is agentic. We encourage developers to embrace these concepts and

begin building the next generation of intelligent applications. Start experimenting with the

tools and techniques discussed in this whitepaper. Explore the resources available, such

as Google Agentspace, NotebookLM Enterprise, Vertex Eval Service, Cloud Observability,

and Vertex AI Search, to accelerate your development process. Dive into the provided code

examples, tutorials, and documentation to gain hands-on experience. Build, evaluate, iterate,

and contribute to the growing community of agent developers. The possibilities are limitless,

and the time to build is now! Specifically, get started with the code and Colab notebooks in
