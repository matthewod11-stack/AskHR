# Implementation and considerations

The Isson’s IMPACT model and Pease’s Blueprint suggest similar steps to achieve success in

People analytics, create a strong data foundation and encourage a culture of data-driven

decision-making within the business. These two models also create frameworks to promote the

use of data and analytics across HR teams and businesses as a whole to inform decision-

making, drive innovation, and continuously improve performance. However, while the

IMPACT model focuses on communicating and measuring the impacts of the analysis, the

blueprints give a guideline on the development plan of the analysis itself.
