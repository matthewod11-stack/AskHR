It is also noteworthy that although there is considerable interest in stigmas in the social sciences (especially social psychology), relatively little research has explicitly considered stigmas in the related Ô¨Åelds of organiza- tional behavior, HRM, and industrial and organizational psychology (notable exceptions include Bell, McLaughlin, & Sequeiro, 2003; Brief et al., 2000; Colella, 2001; Ragins & Cornwell, 2001; Stone et al., 1992; Stone & Colella, 1996). This is an important concern because the number of individuals with stigmas in the U.S. (e.g., older workers, people with disabilities, members of racial and ethnic groups) is growing, and these individuals will likely face a host of unfair discrimination-related problems in organizations. the way that stigmatized individuals are viewed and treated, their talents and skills will probably be unutilized or underutilized by organizations.
