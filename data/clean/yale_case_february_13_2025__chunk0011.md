# 04 Coaching and remediation

Ongoing feedback and guidance are essential for helping employees identify areas for improvement and build the skills they need to succeed. When managers provide consistent coaching, employees have the chance to address issues before they escalate. However, if support is lacking or feedback is inconsistent, employees may remain unaware of performance gaps, leading to repeated mistakes and unaddressed weaknesses. Structured support, such as Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs), can help employees get back on track, but without these opportunities, minor issues can accumulate over time, ultimately leading to termination as a pis aller.16

When to terminate an employee

The decision to terminate an employee is complex, requiring leaders to carefully weigh both quantitative and qualitative considerations. Clear evidence of underperformance or a lack of fit must be paired with a structured and transparent process, ensuring fairness and minimizing risks. By identifying unfixable performance gaps and exhausting all avenues for improvement, leaders can approach termination as a process that serves the best interests of both the organization and the terminated employee. We identify three specific catalysts for when a CEO and company should move towards a termination (Figure 3).

Termination should always be viewed as a final gambit, pursued only after genuine attempts to support the employee’s growth have been made. Leaders who approach the situation with transparency and fairness can ensure that their decisions are justified and defensible. If, despite these efforts, performance fails to improve, termination may be unavoidable to prevent further strain on team morale, resources, and overall productivity. This approach ensures that every option for resolution has been explored, underscoring the organization’s commitment to fairness and integrity in its decision-making.

01 Performance has declined enough to warrant attention

An employee’s declining productivity, disengagement, or behavior misaligned with company values often signals underlying performance or fit issues. These concerns might manifest through missed deadlines, frequent conflicts with colleagues, or disruptive behavior that hinders team morale. Such signs warrant immediate attention and intervention to determine whether the issues are temporary or indicative of more profound incompatibilities.17

02 Core job requirements remain unfulfilled with no realistic prospect of improvement

Consistently failing to meet the fundamental requirements of a role is one of the most apparent reasons to consider termination. Persistent performance gaps—such as a sales representative who fails to meet quotas
