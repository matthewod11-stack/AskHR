### **[1. From answer-giver to question-master]{.underline}**

[For generations, leaders rose by having the answers. The boss knew
best. Experience meant expertise. Knowledge was power.]{.underline}

[But now, AI systems can process more information in an hour than you
can in a lifetime. They can identify patterns you\'ll never see,
calculate probabilities you can\'t fathom, and generate solutions you
wouldn\'t imagine. So where does that leave you?]{.underline}

[It leaves you with something AI systems don't have: the ability to ask
the questions that matter. Not \"What\'s the answer?\" but \"What should
we be solving for?\" Not \"What does the data say?\" but \"What does
this mean for human beings?\" Not \"How do we optimize?\" but \"Should
we do this at all?\"]{.underline}

[The new leadership premium isn\'t on knowing --- it\'s on judgment,
wisdom, and critical thinking. It\'s on building organizations that
question rather than just execute. Because in a world where AI provides
infinite answers, the scarcest resource becomes asking the right
questions. Critical thinking --- the ability to analyze, evaluate, and
challenge assumptions --- becomes more valuable than any technical
skill. Leaders must model and cultivate this deeper thinking, teaching
their teams to interrogate AI\'s outputs rather than accept them
blindly.]{.underline}
