communicate with all the stakeholders involved in the 3608 feedback process from the design stage through to implementation and part of this communication process is training. It is imperative to train the ratees in the area of accepting negative feedback. The raters need to be trained about the various rating errors that can occur such as central tendency, halo and leniency errors. It is extremely important that all stakeholders in the process are regularly updated on the process to gain their ``buy- in'' and commitment to the new feedback system.

6 Recipients choose raters. Typically the feedback recipient chooses about ten raters. These raters include the boss, self, subordinates and, less often, internal and external customers (see Figure 1). This is one of the contentious areas in the literature because some writers feel that the recipients may choose raters who will be more ``lenient'' in their ratings.

7 Questionnaire distribution. Questionnaires can take two formats. There is a paper and pencil format whereby the raters use hard copy questionnaires to rate the recipient on various behaviours. A more efficient method is to send a floppy diskette to each of the raters and they can fill out the questionnaire electronically. This system is more efficient as the data can be aggregated easily using customised software and various reports generated from the data. It is important that the raters have the option to send their completed questionnaire to an external location to ensure confidentiality and it has been found that confidentiality is one of the fundamental success factors in multi-source feedback systems.

8 Analysis of feedback data. This is usually done by outside consultants. At this stage, the feedback data are collated using advanced software and there are a number of reports generated from the data. There are a number of ways in which the data can be reported. The ratings on each behaviour can be presented in column format whereby the various raters are placed into categories and recipients can easily compare how they have rated themselves and how the boss, subordinates, and peers have rated them. The data can also be presented in graphical format and recipients can see graphically where the various ratings fall in relation to one another. In some reports, there is also a section appended where comments that are made by any of the raters are reported.

9 Feeding back the feedback. Once the

reports are generated and the final report compiled, the feedback is provided to each of the feedback recipients. This is usually done in a workshop setting where the recipients can discuss their feedback and its significance with a facilitator. It is useful for the participants to discuss their feedback in groups if they so wish. 10 Follow-through. It is at this stage that many organisations fall short in the overall effectiveness of the system. It is essential that the feedback data are used to their full potential in the organisation because these systems are very expensive to design and maintain and it would be a pity to ``fall at the last jump''. Feedback recipients should be able to establish improvement areas and skill gaps that require training and development from the feedback data that they have received. It is pertinent that they design action plans around their deficiencies. The organisation should allocate a coach/ mentor to each of the recipients and this coach/mentor should assist them in their action plan for development.

11 Repeat the process. In organisations where 3608 feedback programmes are running effectively, the process is repeated for the recipients some time after receiving their initial feedback report, i.e. one or two years later. The employees can gain insight into how they are progressing if the process is repeated. However, this process is quite new in many organisations and the goal for those organisations adopting 3608 feedback is to provide a large section of employees with the opportunity to participate in the process the first time rather than giving individuals a second chance. If this feedback system is widely adopted in Ireland, then organisations need to recognise that reiterations of the process are important.

Designing and developing 36088 assessment instruments: alternative models

A number of theoretical and conceptual models are outlined in the literature which may be used to develop 3608 feedback instruments. Nowack (1993) highlights five different models which can be used to design 3608 feedback processes: 1 The first is job analysis. This type of 3608 assessment measures knowledge, skills and ability (KSAs) based on traditional job-analysis procedures. For example, the
