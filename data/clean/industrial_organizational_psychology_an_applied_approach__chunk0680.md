# Filing a Discrimination Charge

As shown in Figure ., a charge of discrimination is usually filed with a govern- ment agency. A state agency is used if the alleged violation involves a state law; and a federal agency, usually the EEOC, handles alleged violations of federal law. An EEOC complaint must be filed within  days of the discriminatory act, but within  days if the complainant has already filed a complaint with a state or local fair-employment practice agency. The government agency will try to notify the employer within  days about the complaint, obtain further information from both parties if necessary, and review the charge to determine whether it has merit.

Outcomes of an EEOC Investigation Charge Does Not Have Merit If, after reviewing a complaint, the governmental agency does not find merit, one of two things can happen based on whether the person filing the complaint accepts the decision. If the complainant accepts the decision, the process ends. If the complainant does not accept the decision, he is issued a “right to sue” letter that entitles him to hire a private attorney and file the case himself.

Charge Has Merit If the EEOC believes that the discrimination charge has merit, it will try to work out a settlement between the claimant and employer without taking the case to court. These settlements might include an employer offering a job or promotion to the person filing the complaint, the payment of back wages, and the payment of compensatory or punitive damages. These settlements can range in size from a few dollars to more than $ million:
