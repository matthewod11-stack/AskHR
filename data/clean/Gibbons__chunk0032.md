### **[The questions that matter now]{.underline}**

[The critical questions for CHROs have shifted from operational to
existential:]{.underline}

[Instead of \"How do we fill roles?\" ask \"What human capabilities will
matter when AI can do most tasks?\" Instead of \"How do we measure
performance?\" ask \"How do we recognize uniquely human contributions?\"
Instead of \"How do we develop leaders?\" ask \"How do we help leaders
navigate human-AI collaboration?\"]{.underline}

[Most fundamentally: Are you preparing your organization for a world
where humans and AI work as colleagues, or are you still treating AI as
just another tool in the toolkit?]{.underline}

[The CHROs who answer these questions thoughtfully --- who embrace their
role as cultivators of human potential in a hybrid workforce --- will
help their organizations navigate this transformation
successfully.]{.underline}
