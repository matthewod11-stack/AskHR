# resentful.

One solution is to create a pool of former employees who know your

organization well and could consult for a few months to cover the work,

or partner with an organization like The Second Shift, founded by Gina

Hadley and Jenny Galluzzo, which has created a marketplace to match

companies with female experts who can help on certain projects or to

cover leaves. This is how my second maternity leave was handled: My

boss hired a former employee as a consultant to cover my work for the

ﬁve months I was out.
