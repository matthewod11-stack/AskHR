## HBR / Digital Article / Maternity Leave Isn’t Enough to Retain New Moms

If you can’t bring in a consultant and need current team members to

help, ensure they are compensated with a cash bonus or an increase in

base salary. If they don’t have bandwidth, consider tapping other people

in the organization to help and reward them.

How will you assess her performance?

I once received a poor performance review after I’d just come back from

maternity leave. I’d previously been told that I’d met my deliverables

and was leaving the team in strong shape, and the rationale for the new

rating was vague: “The business is now in decline.”

Don’t operate this way. Instead, sit down with people before they take

leave and give them detailed feedback on their performance year-to- date versus their goals. If necessary, explain how the leave will aﬀect

any merit or bonus pay. If a formal review would have taken place while

they’re out, promise another formal review when they return. Some

might want to have this conversation during their leave.

If you are forced to rank team members on a “bell curve,” evaluate those

on maternity leave based on their performance before it. If you ﬁnd that

new parents are falling to the lower end of the curve, your organization

needs to have an open and honest dialogue about the biases you’re

bringing to the table.

What are her career aspirations?

When I once raised my hand for a role that would require signiﬁcant

travel, a former boss said to me: “Your kids are too young. You don’t

want to be on the road and away from them that much.” I wasn’t given

the option to apply; the decision was made for me.

Don’t assume that new mothers want to be on the “mommy

track.” Instead, continue to ask about and understand her career
