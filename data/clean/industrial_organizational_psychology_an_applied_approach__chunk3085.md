# Why Teams Don’t Always Work

Given that the scientific literature suggests that teams are seldom more effective than individuals (Allen & Hecht, ), there has been an abundance of advice in the literature about how to create successful teams. In a study investigating this advice, Hyatt and Ruddy () found that customer service teams were most effective when they received the necessary support from management (e.g., infor- mation, technology, training), had confidence in their ability to complete their tasks; were customer oriented; exhibited an open, supportive, and professional communication style; had set appropriate goals; and followed an agreed-upon

group process. Moran, Musselwhite, and Zenger () identified  common problems encountered by teams. Let’s look at the six most important ones.

The Team Is Not a Team Consistent with the previous discussion, teams often aren’t successful because they are teams in name only.

Excessive Meeting Requirements A common problem with teams is that they either meet too infrequently or meet so often that they waste time when they do meet. The key to successful team meetings is to limit the topics to be discussed and to meet only when the entire team is needed to contribute. Furthermore, teams often feel the need to meet for the entire time for which a meeting is scheduled, even though the necessary busi- ness could be conducted in much less time. This tendency to “stretch” a meeting can reduce the motivation and enthusiasm of a team.

As an example of the tendency to meet too often, I was placed on one of several teams whose task it was to address specific problems facing the univer- sity. Our team leader (committee chair) wanted us to meet every Wednesday at  o’clock until our task was completed. Because of the nature of our task, weeks might pass before we had anything new to bring to the group. Yet we still met every Wednesday. After four weeks, attendance at the meetings dropped to about %. When our angry team leader confronted our team members, she was shocked to hear such comments as, “These weekly meetings are a waste of time” and “I always attend the important meetings, just not the worthless ones.”

I was on another committee that demonstrated the tendency to stretch meetings. The committee comprised  people and met one Friday a month from : p.m. to : p.m. When the dean ran the meetings, they always ended at exactly : p.m. When the dean was out of town, the committee’s vice-chair (the second in command, not the person in charge of vice) would start the meetings by saying, “Let’s do our business and get out of here.” On these occasions, we never stayed past : p.m.

Lack of Empowerment Many teams are formed to solve problems but are not given sufficient authority to conduct their business. According to Moran et al. (), teams aren’t empowered because managers worry that the job won’t be done correctly, the teams are moving too fast, and the teams will overstep their boundaries such that other parts of the organization will be affected. This last managerial concern is especially important because as teams work to solve problems, their solutions often involve many dif- ferent departments. If the teams are not properly empowered, they will lack the authority to overcome the political resistance of each affected department.

Though empowerment is essential for the success of most teams, it is not uncommon for team members to reject their empowered status. After all, with the advantages of empowerment come the risks of making mistakes and getting others angry. To many employees, these risks override the benefits of empowerment.

Lack of Skill It is assumed that members assigned to a team have the skills necessary to effectively carry out their assignment. Unfortunately, this is often not the case (Yandrick, a). What is most common is for team members to lack either the skills needed to work in a team (e.g., communication, problem solving) or the
