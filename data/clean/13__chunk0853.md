## Developing New Research on Humor and Culture in Organizations

group or organization-level cohesiveness, perhaps using well-established measures of cohesiveness (see Duncan, 1984, for an example of empirical research in which an ad hoc measure was used), has the potential to provide clear evidence for one of the foundational assumptions made about humor in organizations.

Other research questions regarding cohesiveness in organizations are also begging for attention. For example, it would be interesting to determine if humor use is different in high versus low cohesiveness groups, or in groups that have been together for a short versus long amount of time. Researchers could explore the possibility that the content of humor varies over time, or with the needs of the group at different points in time. For instance, while in in the formation stage, group members might avoid using humor communications that have a negative tone (e.g., sarcastic humor), to help ensure that group bonds have a chance to form. Alternatively, humor that helps convey negative emotions, concerns, aggression, or other phenomena associated with the forming stage of a group might be particularly frequent. However, in the later stages of a group, perhaps more humor might be employed that targets outgroup members, which might serve to reinforce the groupâ€™s unique identity independent of outgroups and competitors.
