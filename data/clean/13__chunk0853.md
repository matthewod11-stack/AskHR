Barker (2002), for example, writes that exposure to humor seems to ‘‘widen pathways among the brain’s lobes’’ (p. 168). A considerable body of empirical research supports the notion that humor and creativity are associated. Some of this research has examined the relationship between measures of individuals’ sense of humor and measures of creativity, and has obtained signiﬁcant correlations (e.g., Davis & Rimm, 1977; Humke & Schaefer, 1996; Kovac, 1999; Rouff, 1975; Wycoff & Pryor, 2003).
