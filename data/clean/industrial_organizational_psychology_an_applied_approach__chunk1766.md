# During the Interview

Because employees and supervisors are often anxious about performance reviews, it is a good idea to begin the interview with some small talk until the jitters go away. Once the employee and supervisor are feeling as comfortable as they are going to get, the supervisor should communicate the following: () the role of performance appraisal—that making decisions about salary increases and termi- nations is not its only purpose; () how the performance appraisal was conducted; () how the evaluation process was accomplished; () the expectation that the appraisal interview will be interactive; and () the goal of understanding and improving performance.

The review process is probably best begun with the employee communicating her own ratings and her justification for them (Bacal, ). Research indicates that employees who are actively involved in the interview from the start will be more satisfied with the results (Gilliland & Langdon, ; Roberts, ).

The supervisor then communicates her ratings and the reasons for them. The supervisor should limit this communication to statements about behavior and performance rather than traits that are or are not possessed by the employee. Of course, it would be nice to avoid negative feedback because employees then are more satisfied with their reviews and don’t develop negative attitudes toward

evaluating employee performance
