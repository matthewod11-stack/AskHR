## mance appraisal interview more effective: time, scheduling, and preparation.

270

chapter 

Prior to the Interview Allocating Time Both the supervisor and the employee must have time to prepare for the review interview. Both should be allowed at least an hour to prepare before an interview and at least an hour for the interview itself.

Scheduling the Interview The interview location should be in a neutral place that ensures privacy and allows the supervisor and the employee to face one another without a desk between them as a communication barrier. Performance appraisal review interviews should be scheduled at least once every  months for most employees and more often for new employees. Review interviews are commonly scheduled  months after an employee begins working for the organization. If this date comes at a bad time (such as during the Christmas season, a busy time for retail stores), the interview should be scheduled for a more convenient time. It is important to note that although the formal performance appraisal review occurs only once or twice a year, informal “progress checks” should be held throughout the year to provide feedback.

Preparing for the Interview While preparing for the interview, the supervisor should review the ratings she has assigned to the employee and the reasons for those ratings. This step is important because the quality of feedback given to employees will affect their satisfaction with the entire performance appraisal process (Mount, ). Furthermore, employees perceive and react to the amount of time that a supervisor uses to prepare for the interview.

Meanwhile, the employee should rate her own performance using the same format as the supervisor (Roberts, ). The employee also should write down specific reasons and examples that support the ratings she gives herself, as well as ideas for personal development.
