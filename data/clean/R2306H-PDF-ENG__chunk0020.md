# for out-of-the-ordinary ideas.

One business leader who can attest to the value of innovation catalysts

is Jaideep (not his real name), the head of digital transformation at a large health care trust in the UK. For many years its aﬃliated hospitals

had been coping with increasingly longer patient waiting lists and

overcrowded emergency departments. A solution to the waiting lists in

radiology came from an innovation catalyst named Hannah in a group

of Jaideep’s friends from medical school, who for the past 15 years had

held weekend outings twice annually.

Warming up over a cup of tea after a mountain hike, Jaideep and

Hannah got to talking about the waiting lists. Hannah, who’d been

using artiﬁcial intelligence in her work developing new brain cancer

therapies for a major pharmaceutical ﬁrm, suggested AI as an avenue for

Jaideep to explore. She connected him with people in her network who

had pioneered AI in other health care settings, putting him on a path

that would eventually result in the UK’s ﬁrst cloud-based AI radiology

device. Now deployed nationwide, it’s able to read and interpret results

far more quickly than human radiologists, resulting in faster treatment

times and shorter waiting lists.
