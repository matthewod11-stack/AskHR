# Employee Rights

The EPPA provides that employees have a right to employment opportunities without being subjected to lie

detector tests, unless a speciﬁc exemption applies. Where polygraph examinations are allowed, they are

subject to strict standards at the pre-test, testing, and post-testing stages. Speciﬁc notices must be given to

employees or prospective employees. The Act also provides employees the right to ﬁle a lawsuit for violations of the Act. In addition, the Wage and Hour Division accepts complaints of alleged EPPA violations.
