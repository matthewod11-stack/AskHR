## Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, notes, the

company’s mission of “serve, heal, lead, educate and innovate”

translated during COVID into helping the local population get through

the pandemic as safely as possible. Across the organization, “this

existential crisis brought out clarity to our mission,” with employees

feeling inspired to work extra shifts to accommodate surges of sick

patients and help one another cope. It helped that Hart and other

administrators took personal risks at the height of the Covid-19

pandemic, rolling up their sleeves and treating sick patients alongside

front-line caregivers. Their dedication demonstrated the importance

of public service and healing to these leaders personally and to the

organization, serving as a model for others to follow.

In turbulent times, you need a reliable anchor to keep you tethered,

and so do the stakeholders who follow you. Moral communities,

underpinned by purpose, provide that stability as well as a reassuring

sense of hope, solidarity, agency, and meaning. They help you

determine when and how to speak out, and just as importantly, when

to stay silent.
