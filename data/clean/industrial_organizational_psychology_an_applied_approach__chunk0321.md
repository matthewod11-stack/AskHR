In the s, I/O psychology greatly expanded its scope. Until then, it had been involved primarily in personnel issues such as the selection and place- ment of employees. However, in the s, when the findings from the famous Hawthorne studies were published, psychologists became more involved in the quality of the work environment, as well as the attitudes of employees. The Hawthorne studies, conducted at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company in the Chicago area, demonstrated that employee behavior was complex and that the interpersonal interactions between managers and employees played a tremendous role in employee behavior. The Hawthorne studies were initially designed to investigate such issues as the effects of light- ing levels, work schedules, wages, temperature, and rest breaks on employee performance.

Much to the surprise of the researchers, the actual work conditions did not affect productivity in the predicted manner. That is, there were times when productivity improved after work conditions were made worse, and times when productivity decreased after work conditions were made better. After interviewing employees and studying the matter further, the researchers realized that employ- ees changed their behavior and became more productive because they were being studied and received attention from their managers, a condition that is now commonly referred to as the Hawthorne effect. Perhaps the major contribution of the Hawthorne studies was that it inspired psychologists to increase their focus on human relations in the workplace and to explore the effects of employee attitudes (Olson, Verley, Santos, & Salas, ).

The s were characterized by the passage of several major pieces of civil rights legislation, which are discussed in Chapter . These laws focused the atten- tion of HR professionals on developing fair selection techniques. As a result, the need for I/O psychologists greatly increased. The s were also characterized by the use of sensitivity training and T-groups (laboratory training groups) for managers (Carson, Lanier, Carson, & Guidry, ).

The s brought great strides in the understanding of many organiza- tional psychology issues that involved employee satisfaction and motivation. The decade also saw the development of many theories about employee behavior in organizations. B. F. Skinner’s () Beyond Freedom and Dignity resulted in the increased use of behavior-modification techniques in organizations.

The s and s brought four major changes to I/O psychology. The first involved an increased use of fairly sophisticated statistical techniques and methods of analysis. This change is evident if one compares journal articles written in the s with those written since . More recent articles use such complex statistical techniques as path analysis, meta-analysis, multivari- ate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and causal modeling. Prior to the s, simpler statistical techniques such as t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used (unless you are wearing a pocket protector or have taken a statistics course, these methods probably are not familiar to you). This reliance on statis- tics explains why students enrolled in an I/O psychology doctoral program take at least five statistics courses as part of their education.

A second change concerned a new interest in the application of cognitive psy- chology to industry. For example, articles written about performance appraisal in the s primarily described and tested new methods for evaluating employee performance. In the s and early s, however, many articles approached the performance appraisal issue by examining the thought process used by man- agers when they conduct such appraisals.

The third change was the increased interest in the effects of work on family life and leisure activities (McCarthy, ). Though stress had long been of inter- est to psychologists, it was during the last two decades of the twentieth century that employee stress—especially stress resulting in workplace violence—received attention.

The final major change in the s and s came about when I/O psy- chologists took a renewed interest in developing methods to select employees. In the s and s, the courts were still interpreting the major civil rights acts of the early s, with the result that I/O psychologists took a cautious approach in selecting employees. By the mid-s, however, the courts became less strict, and a wider variety of selection instruments was developed and used. Examples of these instruments include cognitive ability tests, personality tests, biodata, and structured interviews. Other changes during the s and s that had significant effects on I/O psychology included massive organizational downsizing, greater concern for diversity and gender issues, an aging workforce, increased concern about the effects of stress, and the increased emphasis on such organizational development interventions as total quality management (TQM), reengineering, and employee empowerment.

In the s, perhaps the greatest influence on I/O psychology is the rapid advances in technology. Many tests and surveys are now administered through computers and the Internet, employers recruit and screen applicants online, employees are being trained using e-learning and distance education, and man- agers are holding meetings in cyberspace rather than in person.

Another important factor that will impact I/O psychology is the changing demographic make-up of the workforce: Women are increasingly entering the workforce and taking on managerial roles; Hispanics and Latinos are now the largest minority group in the United States; Asian Americans are the fastest- growing segment of the U.S. population; and an increasing number of workers, vendors, and customers have English as their second language. Thus, diversity issues will continue to be an important factor in the workplace.

The global economy will also affect the role of I/O psychology. As many manufacturing jobs are shifted to developing countries with lower wages, there will be an increased emphasis on service jobs requiring human relations skills. As an increasing number of employees work in other countries (as expatriates) and as rates of immigration (both legal and illegal) increase, efforts must keep pace to understand various cultures, and training must be conducted so that employ- ees and managers can successfully work not only in other countries, but at home with expatriates from other countries.

Other factors that will impact I/O psychology include movements toward flexible work schedules, family-friendly work policies, accommodation of an increasing number of employees with child-care and elder-care responsibilities, flatter organizational structures with fewer management levels, population shifts from urban to suburban locations, and increasing costs of health-care benefits. In addition, potential changes in the retirement age for Social Security may result in employees working into their late sixties.
