The present study on evolving paradigms in supply chain research indicates several

indications of triggers that may be evolving. It may emerge as a sudden event in the not-too-

distant future, and the capabilities and innovativeness will be again under examination for

target achievement and performance improvement. In this context, Industrial 5.0 and allied

extension in sustainability dimensions and the need for supply chain agility under extreme

pressure from a reconfiguration perspective have been carried out since the Reconfigurable

SC has been advocated as the most recent and robust among all the paradigms. The consensus

that can be agreed upon is the positioning of Reconfiguration at the forefront for future

evolving challenges.

Although evolving drivers may be divergent from existing research practices, the scope and

applicability of the reconfiguration principle cannot be denied. Rather than focusing on

individual research paradigms requirements, the reconfigurations provide a more holistic and

robust practice that can be utilized with dynamic capabilities and integration towards several
