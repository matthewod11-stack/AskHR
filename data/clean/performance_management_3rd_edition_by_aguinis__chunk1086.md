## 6.7 PREVENTING RATING DISTORTION THROUGH RATER TRAINING PROGRAMS

Rater training programs have the overall objective of providing raters with tools that will allow them to implement the performance management system effectively and efficiently. These training programs also help prevent rating distortion. Table 6.3 summarizes the reasons discussed earlier for why raters are likely to inflate or deflate ratings.
