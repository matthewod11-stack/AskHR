## mental illness. In Psychedelic Outlaws: The Movement Revolutionizing

Modern Medicine, Kempner follows research into whether psilocybin

can relieve cluster headaches. The condition, known as “suicide

headaches” because they can last for weeks or even months, is

described by one study as more painful than stab wounds, kidney

stones, pancreatitis, or unmedicated labor. (Needless to say, work

becomes impossible for those suﬀering from it.) Connected online and

operating illegally, a network dubbed the Clusterbusters grew their

own magic mushrooms, developed their own treatment protocols, and

eventually drew the attention of researchers and policymakers. “The

internet provided the kind of safe, unregulated space…where drug

geeks could create their own repositories for the kinds of…information diﬃcult to obtain elsewhere,” Kempner writes.

Two other recent releases chronicle their authors’ own use of

psychedelics—and the fellow users they encountered on their journeys.

After all, this is a community that values lived experience as much as it

does scientiﬁc studies.
