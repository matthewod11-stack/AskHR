# A Future History 171

know full well, though they have difﬁculty putting into words, what emotions are, what it is to be emotional, what experiences qualify as emotions, and so forth. However, these agreements vary from language to language and from community to community (Geertz, 1973) .

Given that the emotions are established facts of everyday experience, it is initially useful to determine what organizes the common language of emotion in the ﬁrst place, and then to ﬁnd a reasonable theoretical account that provides a partial understanding of these language uses. But as we have seen, these theoretical accounts themselves vary widely. In recent years theoretical deﬁnitions of emotions have been so broad that they seem to cover anything that human beings do, as in the notion that emotions are “episodic, relatively short-term, biologically based patterns of perception, experience, physi- ology, action, and communication that occur in response to speciﬁc physical and social challenges and opportunities” (Keltner & Gross, 1999).

Is there anything that is essential to the use of the term “emotion,” some aspect that represents the core that would help us ﬁnd a theoretical direction out of the jungle of terms and theories? Lexicographers perform an important function in that their work is cumulative and, in general, responds to the nuances and the changing customs of the common lan- guage. What do they tell us? Webster’s Seventh New Colle- giate Dictionary (1969) says that emotion is “a psychic and physical reaction subjectively experienced as strong feeling and physiologically involving changes that prepare the body for immediate vigorous action,” and that affect is deﬁned as “the conscious subjective aspect of an emotion considered apart from bodily changes.” Here is the traditional deﬁnition, which responds to the advice of our elder statesmen Darwin and James that visceral changes are a necessary part of the emotions. But they are not sufﬁcient; we still require the affective component. Assuming that “affect” falls under a broad deﬁnition of cognition, including information, cogita- tion, subjective classiﬁcation and other mental entities, the advantageofanaffective/cognitivecomponentisthatitmakes all possible emotions accessible.

Whatever evaluative cognitions arise historically and cul- turally, they are potentially part of the emotional complex. Thus, emotions different from the Western traditions (e.g., Lutz, 1988) become just as much a part of the corpus as tran- scultural fears and idiosyncratically Western romantic love. However, even such an extension covers only a limited sec- tion of the panoply of emotions, and the arousal/cognition ap- proach may not be sufﬁcient.

It is unlikely that the question of a deﬁnition of the com- monsense meaning of emotion will easily be resolved. And so I close this section by returning to a quote from Charles
