While these leaders may be well-meaning and eager to help their new

employees get acclimated to their role, bombarding new hires with a

deluge of information can also backﬁre. Our brains can only process a

ﬁnite amount of new information at one time, and even less when we

are novices. As a result, new employees are susceptible to the impact of

excessive (extraneous) cognitive load during onboarding. This can lead

to diminished performance or even the new hire deciding the new job is

not a great ﬁt, and leaving.

In my research, both in academia and corporations, I’ve identiﬁed three

strategies leaders can implement to help reduce employee overwhelm and ensure new employees are onboarded eﬀectively and eﬃciently.
