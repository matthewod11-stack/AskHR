References typically are not good predictors of performance due to such factors as leniency, poor reliability, fear of legal ramifications, and a variety of extraneous factors. The trait approach to scoring letters of recommendation is a valid method of predicting future performance. Reliability, validity, cost, and potential for legal problems should be considered when choosing the right type of employment test for a particular situation. Cognitive ability tests, job knowledge tests, biodata, work samples, and assessment centers are some of the better techniques in predicting future performance. Personality inventories, interest inventories, references, and graphology are not highly related to employee performance. Drug testing and medical exams are commonly used to screen employees prior to their starting a job. Writing a well-designed rejection letter can have important organizational consequences.
