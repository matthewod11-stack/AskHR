# Era of Reform

Several factors led to the origin of school psychology as a distinct discipline. Paramount among these was a post–Civil War era of reform marked by the rise of juvenile courts, the enactment of child labor laws, the growth of institutions

serving children, the beginnings of the mental health, voca- tional guidance, and child study movements, and the enact- ment of compulsory school attendance laws for children. Collectively, these efforts reﬂected the improving status of children and youth in America and a growing commitment to the viewpoint that the welfare of our children was closely related to the long-term improvement of our society.
