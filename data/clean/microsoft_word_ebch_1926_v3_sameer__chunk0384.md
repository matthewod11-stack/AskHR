# CONCLUSION

Data privacy and cybersecurity have gained significant prominence in recent years, with the proliferation of digital technology and the increasing importance of data. Regulations like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have imposed strict requirements on how organizations handle personal data. Compliance in this context involves obtaining explicit consent for data collection, ensuring data security, and providing individuals with the right to access and delete their data. Non- compliance with these regulations can result in substantial fines and reputational damage. Financial compliance is another critical area, especially for publicly traded companies. Regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in the United States require companies to maintain transparent and accurate financial reporting. SOX compliance involves internal controls, audit trails, and the independence of external auditors to prevent financial misconduct and fraud. Failing to comply with financial regulations can erode investor trust and trigger legal actions.
