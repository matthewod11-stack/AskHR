# G= Growth needs

Alderfer’s Existence needs has to do with the satisfaction of our basic material requirement such as food, water, pay and working conditions, they can be classified as physical and safety needs.

The relatedness needs is similar to the social role needs of Maslow’s theory and their includes social and interpersonal relationship.

Finally, the growth need is intrinsic desire for personal development or making creative productive contribution. Alderfer argued that if the gratification of a higher level order need is stifled, the desire to satisfy a lower level need increase i. e frustration, regression and dimension (Stone et al, 2009). Alderfer also suggests that people can have the desire to fulfill the three needs at a time and pursue them simultaneously.

Another type of need theory is the Acquired need theory. This was made popular by David McClelland and states that some needs are acquired as a result of life experiences. He identifies need for achievement, need for affiliation and need for power to control others.
