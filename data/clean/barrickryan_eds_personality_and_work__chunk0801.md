# Conclusion

We have raised four issues of relevance to understanding the role of personality in PO ﬁt assessments. First, we considered the ques- tion of whether personality-based PO ﬁt even matters. Because of the stability, proximity, and visibility of personality, we argue strongly that PO ﬁt on personality does matter, but that it depends on the speciﬁc type of ﬁt that is being assessed. Our review of the literature suggests that when personality-based PO ﬁt is measured as complementary ﬁt rather than personality congruence, stronger results are found.

The second question we addressed was when good PO ﬁt on personality has negative consequences and when bad PO ﬁt might actually beneﬁt individuals and organizations. In particular, we de- scribed the positive outcomes of bad ﬁt when it leads to growth and development and when good ﬁt exists on characteristics that in- volve ﬂexibility and adaptability.

Third, we considered the accuracy of personality-based PO ﬁt perceptions and concluded that again it depends on whether com- plementary or supplementary ﬁt is being considered and the spe- ciﬁc traits involved. Complementary ﬁt should be more accurately assessed because it tends to be based on personal needs and objec- tive organizational characteristics, whereas supplementary ﬁt is more contingent on accurate assessments of others’ personalities. More visible personality traits (those that involve a social compo- nent) should lead to more accurate ﬁt assessments by recruiters, coworkers, and other observers. Moreover, we suggest that individ- uals may systematically differ in the extent to which they accurately perceive ﬁt and are willing to change themselves or the environ- ment in order to increase ﬁt.

Finally, we discussed what we see as a fruitful area for future re- search: the link between personality-based PO ﬁt and adaptability. Although we do not claim to answer the four questions we set out at the beginning of the chapter, we hope that by raising them and discussing the issues that are relevant to their resolution, we will inspire further research on personality-based PO ﬁt.
