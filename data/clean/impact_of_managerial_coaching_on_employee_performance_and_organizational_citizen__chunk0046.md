# 4.1.2 Convergent Validity

The present study support for construct validity because a correlation between all the study variables was lower. Construct validity was checked for convergent and discriminant validity. For convergent validity, the value of AVE should be (AVE â‰¥ 0.5). The values of AVE are described in the following table. The results show that all the five latent variables Cronbach alpha exceeded over 0.7 and AVE values greater than 0.5. So, in this study convergent validity seems to be attained (Hair et al., 1995).
