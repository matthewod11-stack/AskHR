# A Month-by-Month Process

We think of the CEO onboarding process as consisting of ﬁve distinct

phases, each lasting approximately one month. We name the stages

according to what they look like from the incoming CEO’s perspective:

learn, listen, observe, own, and evaluate. We assume that during the

opening stages, the incumbent CEO remains in the role to facilitate the

hand-oﬀ, as is typical in most planned CEO transitions.

For each phase, we outline basic objectives for the new CEO, describe a

big-picture view of what will be necessary from the company to achieve

those objectives, and explain the unique dynamics that come into play
