This paper has had the objective of profiling the trends in performance appraisal, competency and skills development and considering how appraisal systems can be more effectively implemented.

There is powerful evidence that performance appraisal and related staff development can have a major impact on service outcomes, and large employers almost universally have some type of performance management process. A significant proportion of large UK employers have changed their process in recent years and many plan further changes. But, although some American writers may herald the death of performance appraisal, some type of process with similar objectives typically remains in place, if in a different form and guise. Change is apparently almost inevitable amidst the realities, speed and pressure of organisational life today, and is a route to improved impact, rather than an admission of failure.

Common changes and apparent keys to improvement in appraisal and development processes externally, highlighted in research, include:

(cid:1) Simultaneously focusing more broadly on organisational performance and on initiatives required to support that, whilst also simplifying and speeding the core processes.

(cid:1) Providing more support and training in the use of the system to line managers

and ensuring senior management commitment and example-setting.

(cid:1) Giving employees higher levels of understanding and involvement and allowing them to drive and shape the process to a much greater extent.

(cid:1) Focusing on development and performance outcomes and measuring and

demonstrating them.

(cid:1) Allowing for greater adaptation and flexibility to tailor a simpler common

framework to suit diverse local needs and cultures.
