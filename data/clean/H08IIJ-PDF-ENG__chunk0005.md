## a pharmaceutical company, a professional services organization, and

a university. We interviewed and observed 72 of these workers, who

were almost all extremely devoted to excellence in their work. We found

that a subset — speciﬁcally, the workers with young children who were

the primary caregiving parent or shared this role with their spouse —

felt short on time. This, of course, is no surprise to parents of kids

or anyone else who has extensive caregiving responsibilities such as

eldercare. What we also found, however, was that in addition to the

sorts of “typical” management of time one might expect to ﬁnd (e.g.,

scheduling), these workers tried to manage interactions.
