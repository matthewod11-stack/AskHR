## For instance, for a global material sciences company, Joy and her

team created a 15-month training program that guides Asian learners

from being peak performers to becoming extraordinary leaders. The

program begins by clarifying the “unwritten rules” of Western business

and encouraging cultural self-discovery, allowing learners to recognize

and appreciate their cultural strengths. We then teach the emotional

intelligence (EQ) skills which are highly valued in Western corporations.

Crucially, these programs extend beyond training the Asian employees

themselves. We also provide a streamlined module for their managers

and sponsors, equipping these leaders to eﬀectively support and lead

multicultural teams. This is essential because frontline leaders are

crucial for supporting Asian employees—and indeed, all employees – to

be both eﬀective and authentic at work.

Promote and integrate qualiﬁed Asian employees into organizational leadership.

Creating equitable career opportunities for Asian professionals

necessitates a concerted eﬀort from leadership to establish unbiased

career progression frameworks. Research from the Journal of Business
