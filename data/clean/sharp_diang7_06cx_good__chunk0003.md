THERE IS NO ONE magical solution that enables companies to succeed in today’s competitive global marketplace. However, businesses are increasingly adopting com- petency models,which prove their value as a human resources management tool.

Sharp Electronics Corporation, the North American sales and marketing subsidiary of Osaka, Japan-based Sharp Corporation, was among the first wave of companies to adopt competency models and is now set to embark upon a second phase.

Sharp developed a core competency model nearly seven years ago. The second

phase of the initiative will include five competency models that are specific to several strategically important job func- tions in sales and marketing, and a revised core competency model.

High-potential employees Sharp’s interest in developing its initial core competency model was instigated by the need to adapt to a more competitive market characterized by increased cus- tomer requirements and many new digital products. To meet that demand, the com- pany set out to clarify the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that would enable employees to achieve the organization’s goals. While competency models have many applications, some appealed more than others to important stakeholders.
