## businesses with at least 10,000 employees, almost half (48%) lack

paternity leave.

Worse, when paternity leave is offered, the pressures on men not to take it

are often extreme. Some new dads have been ﬁred, demoted and lost job

opportunities for doing so.

My book, All In, is ﬁlled with such stories, and parents often share

anecdotes with me. A lawyer in Florida recently told me that his boss said

to him, “We have six weeks of paternity leave, but you’re not taking any.”

A public relations executive in California told me her husband’s boss

criticized him, asking, “Why isn’t your wife doing that?”

In a survey I helped develop for Dove Men+Care (a brand I partner with)

and Promundo, 73% of fathers said there’s little workplace support for

them. Twenty-one percent fear losing their jobs if they take their full

paternity leave. “We’re still held back by two traditional stereotypes: that

men are the primary breadwinners and women are the primary caregivers

for children,” the survey found.

These stereotypes, vestiges of the Mad Men era, hurt everyone. They hold

back women’s careers, since families are left with no choice but for women

to do more caregiving. They hurt children, who need time with both

parents. They damage businesses, which lose great women and men. EY

found that men are even more likely than women to switch jobs or careers

to have more time with their families.

It isn’t easy to stand up to the pressures against taking paternity leave.

With a new child in the home, things are hectic — and, in most cases,

money is tight. The last thing dads can do is risk their jobs and careers.
