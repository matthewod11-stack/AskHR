# Getting into Graduate School

Although different graduate programs often em-

phasize different entrance requirements, most place some weight on GRE scores, GPA, letters of recommendation, and previous research or profession- al experience. With this in mind, following the advice below should increase your chances of being selected for a graduate program. S

Take extra mathematics and English courses. The GRE consists of four sections: quantitative, verbal, writing, and psychology. The quantitative portion requires knowledge of algebra, geometry, and some trigonometry. Thus, often the only way to do well on this section is to take extra courses in these subjects. Taking English courses in reading comprehension, writing, and vocabulary will help your score on the verbal and writing sections. It is important to understand that the GRE is a test of knowledge, not intelligence. Thus, with extra coursework, you can improve your scores. Remem- ber, it will have been a long time since you took these courses in high school.
