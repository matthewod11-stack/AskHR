# from assumptions about individuals.

A research survey such as the Camerer-Malmendier essay tries to look both

backward over what is known, and forward toward what should be researched.

Since so much of what is known was accumulated in the “deviations” perspective,

it is appropriate that it play a large role. However, since the gains are developing

so rapidly in contemporary psychology and the new tools becoming available are

so powerful, it is natural that much of the forward thinking about what research is promising should bring in the perspective of “how the brain works,”>?

32Indeed, though it is not mentioned here, Camerer himself is doing intriguing work of this kind, as

in his recent collaboration on brain imaging of trust development (King-Casas et al. 2005).
