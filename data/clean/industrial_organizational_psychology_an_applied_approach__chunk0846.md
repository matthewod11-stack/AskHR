Plan is legal

Long v. City of Saginaw (1988) Johnson v. Santa Clara (1987) U.S. v. Phillip Paradise (1987) Youngblood v. Dalzell (1986) Steel Workers v. Weber (1979)

Higgins v. City of Vallejo (1987) Ledoux v. District of Columbia (1987) Smith v. Harvey (1986) Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education (1986) Grutter v. Bollinger (2003)

The courts consider five criteria in assessing an affirmative action plan: his- tory of the organization, beneficiaries of the plan, population to be considered, impact on the nonminority group, and the endpoint of the plan.

A History of Discrimination The first criterion examined is whether there has been a history of discrimination by a particular organization (Western States Paving v. Washington State Depart- ment of Transportation, ). If no discrimination has previously occurred, then an affirmative-action plan is neither necessary nor legal. For example, if % of the qualified workforce is African American, as is % of a police department’s officers, it would be illegal to engage in preferential hiring based on race. How- ever, if % of the qualified workforce is African American and there are no Afri- can American state troopers (as was the case in Alabama in ), preferential hiring could be justified (U.S. v. Phillip Paradise, ).

In Taxman v. Board of Education of the Township of Piscataway (), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the use of race as a factor to break a tie between two equally qualified applicants. Sharon Taxman, a White teacher, and Debra Williams, an African American teacher, were tied in seniority. When the Piscataway School Board decided to lay off a teacher, it kept Williams because she was African American. The appeals court ruled the decision to be unconsti- tutional because there was no racial disparity between the faculty and the quali- fied workforce. This case was settled in , a few days before it was scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Benefi ciaries of the Plan The second criterion concerns the extent to which the plan benefits people who were not actual victims of discrimination. If the plan benefits only actual victims, it will probably be considered legal, but if it benefits people not directly discrimi- nated against by the organization, other criteria will be considered.

For example, imagine an organization consisting of  male but no female managers. Twenty female assistant managers, after being denied promotions for several years, file suit charging discrimination. The organization agrees to hire ten of the females to fill the next ten openings. Because the beneficiaries of this plan were themselves the actual victims of the organization’s previous discrimina- tion, the plan would be legal. If the plan, however, involved promoting females who had not previously applied for the management positions, the courts, before determining the legality of the plan, would consider three factors: the population used to set the goals, the impact on non-minorities, and the endpoint of the plan.

Population Used to Set Goals The third criterion concerns which of two types of populations was used to sta- tistically determine discrimination and to set affirmative-action goals. With area populations, an organization compares the number of minorities in the general area with the number of minorities in each position in the organization. If a dis- crepancy occurs, the organization sets hiring goals to remedy the discrepancy. For example, if % of the area surrounding an organization is Hispanic but only % of the salaried workers in the organization are Hispanic, the organization might set hiring goals for Hispanics at % until the workforce becomes % Hispanic.

Although the use of area population figures has been traditional, recent Supreme Court decisions have declared them inappropriate. Instead, the popu- lation that must be used in goal setting is that of the qualified workforce in the area rather than the area population as a whole.

For example, several southern states are under court supervision to increase the number of minority faculty in their public universities. Rather than a goal con- sistent with the percentage of African Americans in the United States (roughly %), the goal of % is based on the qualified workforce—African Americans with doctoral degrees. This example is important because it illustrates that the courts are not unreasonable when it comes to setting affirmative action goals. They realize that a university cannot hire minorities in numbers equal to the national popula- tion because a lower percentage of minorities than nonminorities have doctorates. Another example is the case of City of Richmond v. Croson (). Because % of the Richmond population is minority, the city required that contractors receiving city funds subcontract at least % of their work to minority-owned businesses. The J. A. Croson Company received a contract with the city but was

unable to subcontract the required % because there were not enough minority- owned businesses in the city. The U.S. Supreme Court found Richmond’s plan illegal because the goal of % was based on the area population rather than the percentage of relevant qualified minority-owned businesses (less than %). The U.S. Supreme Court ruled similarly in Adarand v. Pena ().

Impact on Nonminorities The fourth criterion used by courts to determine the legality of an affirmative action program is whether the remedy designed to help minorities is narrowly tailored: Does the plan “unnecessarily trammel” the rights of nonminorities? That is, a plan that helps women cannot deny the rights of men. Preference can be given to a qualified minority over a qualified nonminority, but an unqualified minority can never be hired over a qualified nonminority.

Affirmative action becomes controversial when an organization realizes it has discriminated against a particular protected group. For example, police and fire departments have long been staffed by White men. In some cases, this com- position has been accidental; in others it has been intentional. To remedy such situations, police and fire departments often set goals for minority hiring. These goals are objectives and are not to be confused with quotas, which require a cer- tain percentage of minorities to be hired. This is an important distinction, as the  Civil Rights Act forbids the use of quotas.

Should only a small number of minority applicants test highly enough to be considered qualified, the organization is under no obligation to hire unqualified applicants. In fact, if an organization hires unqualified minorities over qualified nonminorities, hires a lesser qualified minority over a more qualified nonminority, or sets unreasonable goals, it can be found guilty of reverse discrimination. For example, in Bishop v. District of Columbia (), the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that reverse discrimination occurred when an African American battalion chief was promoted ahead of five higher-ranking White deputy chiefs. The court ruled the promotion to be illegal because it was the result of political pressure rather than qualifications and previous job performance. A similar decision was reached in Black Firefighters Association v. City of Dallas (), when the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that “skip promotions” were not legal.

In Higgins v. City of Vallejo (), however, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that promotion of a minority applicant with the third-highest score over a non- minority applicant with the highest score was legal. The court’s decision was based on the idea that even though the two applicants had different scores, they were close enough to be considered “equally qualified.” When two candidates are equally qualified, affirmative action needs can be taken into consideration to decide which of the candidates will be chosen. As one can imagine, the question of how close different qualifications need to be before two candidates are no lon- ger considered equal is difficult to answer. In Chapter , methods to answer this question, such as banding and passing scores, will be discussed.

The two most recent U.S. Supreme Court cases involving affirmative action confirm what you have learned in the previous discussion. Both cases involved preferential treatment of minorities in the admission practices at the University of Michigan: Grutter v. Bollinger () involved law school admissions, and Gratz v. Bollinger () involved undergraduate admissions. In both cases, the Supreme Court ruled that increasing diversity was a compelling government interest. In the Grutter case, the court ruled that using race as one of many factors
