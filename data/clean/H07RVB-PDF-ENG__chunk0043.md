# ideation sessions.

Because the worst thing that can happen to a company right now is you say to people, “I need you in the oﬃce Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,”

and then they come in and they sit at their desk all day and they’re on

Zoom meetings. You’re going to have that problem where people will

be like,” I’d rather just do this from home then. I could take care of my

children, I could take care of my pets. It would just be easier for me.”

In this new work environment, you have to ﬁnd ways that when your

teams are in person, there’s real value in the activities you’re having

them do. There’s certain things that you can only do in person. I

am old-school. Brainstorming, whiteboarding, those kind of ideation

sessions, whatever you call them, I love having ﬁve or six people in a

room with pieces of paper or whiteboards to write on. I have tried every

whiteboarding tool that goes with Zoom or Teams or Google Meet, and it

just has not been as eﬀective for me. But I’m trying to learn because I’m

respecting that this is the way of work today.
