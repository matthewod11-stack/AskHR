# 130 PERSONALITY AND WORK

construct like affect states. Essentially, they have dispositionalized affect itself. They have done this in one of two ways. One way has been to examine constructs that are traitlike in terms of time frame and to call them affect constructs. This is the satisfaction paradigm. The other way has been to aggregate the momentary experiences either by asking people to provide judgments about their typical or general affective states or to create such summaries mechani- cally from momentary data. The latter approach loses the within- person variability, which is essential to understanding affective experiences over time, as we have seen. The former approach also loses such dynamic data and suffers from the biases inherent in these recollective judgments. Neither approach pays much atten- tion to the nature of affect processes.
