## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 129

ing this format (Weiss et al., 1999) has required innovative meth- ods of comparing the stable personality construct to varying emo- tional responses. One such technique uses the statistical estimates of the distribution parameters, such as the standard deviation of reported emotions (Kurek, Le, & Weiss, 2001), as dependent vari- ables. Other studies have used multilevel modeling techniques to assess the variability within and between people in cross-level analy- ses using these types of data (see Portello & Long, 2001, as an ex- ample). Studies employing these more intense data collection formats have been few in number and still fail to capture the full emotion episode.

Our fourth conclusion about this literature is that there is no clear distinction between affective experience and personality. The averaging of moods and emotions across time dispositionalizes af- fect, creating, in effect, alternative measures of personality. Per- sonality is generally deﬁned as a consistent pattern of behaviors across time. When someone engages in many speciﬁc instances of behavior or attitude across time, this is described as personality, whereas any particular behavior at one point in time would not be labeled in this manner. Someone who is negative over many points in time will be labeled a pessimist, but being pessimistic once does not constitute a pessimist. The point here is that the longer the time frame is in which we are assessing any particular behavior, the more dispositionalized it becomes, and therefore the closer it comes to a measure of personality than of a situationally speciﬁc construct such as affect.

In our review of the literature, it occurred to us that there is a hazy line between the dispositional measures, such as positive and negative affectivity, and the time-bound affect measures. We typi- cally measure one’s personality or disposition as the individual’s typical response. For example, the Positive Affectivity and Negative Affectivity Scales (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) ask for the ex- tent to which the respondents “typically” experience a list of twenty emotions. However, when we are trying to predict a time-bound behavior such as affect using an aggregate measure, we are essen- tially measuring the same construct as those that capture “typical” experiences.

In sum, as a result of examining the literature as a whole, it be- comes clear how I/O researchers have dealt with the problem of using a time-free construct like personality to explain a time-bound
