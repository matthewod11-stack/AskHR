# Reducing Speeding

Human-factors experts have also conducted research to determine ways to reduce speeding by changing the driving environment. For example, De Waard, Jessurun, Steyvers, Raggatt, and Brookhuis () hypothesized that drivers would speed less often if speeding were made perceptually uncomfortable (as opposed to traﬃ c citations, making speeding ﬁ nancially uncomfortable). To do this, De Waard et al. removed the white lines on the right side of a single-lane road and replaced them with intermittent chippings that made noise when run over by a speeding car. Th e idea behind this intervention was that speeding drivers often touch the lines on each side of the lane because they are going too fast to keep their vehicles in the center of the lane. “Penalizing” the speeding driver with a noxious noise reduced average speeds by  kilometers per hour—enough of a reduction to increase safety. In another attempt to reduce speeding, one group of researchers believed that some instances of speeding were the result of drivers being unaware of the speed limit. To reduce this possibility, three researchers at the University of Helsinki in Finland (Lajunen, Hakkarainen, & Summala, ) tested three diﬀ erent types of signs telling drivers to slow down as they were entering a “built-up” (densely pop- ulated) area, in which the national speed limit was  kilometers per hour. Th e ﬁ rst sign contained the symbol for the built-up area; the second, the built-up area symbol plus the symbol for danger; and the third, the built-up area symbol plus the number “” in a circle. As you might expect, drivers reduced their speed most often with the sign that showed the explicit speed limit number, and least often with the two signs in which one had to simply know the speed limit in a built-up area. In the United States, these ﬁ ndings might be generalized to replace signs that say “School Zone” with ones that say “School Zone: Speed Limit  MPH.”

Although this study seems to suggest that signs with text are superior to those with icons and symbols, this is not usually the case. Research indicates that icon/symbol highway signs are easier to read and result in lower reaction times than do text-based highway signs (Long & Kearns, ). Why the contradictory
