EMAIL: ``` Hi,

I have seen you use Wordpress for your website. A great open source content management system. I have used it in the past too. It comes with lots of great user plugins. And it's pretty easy to set up.

I did notice a bug in the contact form, which happens when you select the name field. See the attached screenshot of me entering text in the name field. Notice the JavaScript alert box that I inv0k3d.

But for the rest it's a great website. I enjoy reading it. Feel free to leave the bug in the website, because it gives me more interesting things to read.

Cheers,
