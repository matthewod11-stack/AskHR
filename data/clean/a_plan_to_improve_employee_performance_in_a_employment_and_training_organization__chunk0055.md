effectively . Performance evaluations also contributes in a major way to the quality and

effectiveness of each process involved in doing a job task. Designing a good

productive for the organization but will improve employee performance as a whole .

Effective performance evaluations can foster a mentality among employees to do better

quality work, in turn their confidence soars and this acts as a powerful motivator to doing

a better job. Another benefit of performance evaluation is improved communication

between employees and management who share a common interest to enhance job

performance. Performance evaluations are beneficial to the employee 's ability to control

or manage change. An employee who becomes confident because of the factors or goals

conveyed during a review period can adapt to the changing work place. Good evaluations

can significantly improve productivity and quality of work.

How can public managers motivate their employees to aspire to high performance

levels ( everi when resources are scarce)? Public organizations, like ETR need to view

their employees as a source for strategic planning. Thus, an effective performance

evaluation system is critical to improving the overall performance of the organization and

to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of employees to do the job.
