Our study makes four key contributions to HRD. First, we leverage Social Exchange Theory (SET) and Leader-Member Exchange Theory (LMX) to explain formal coaching’s impact on work-related attitudes and behaviours, critiquing these frameworks and proposing alternatives. Second, we enhance the generalisability of our findings by using propensity score matching (PSM), an advanced statistical technique that mimics random group assignment in non-random samples like ours (Hammack-Brown et al., 2024). Third, instead of taking a summed average approach and using a t-test or ANOVA to estimate the statistical significance of between-group difference, we apply latent mean modelling, which accounts for measurement error and produces more precise and valid estimations (Müller & Schäfer, 2017). Finally, we compare formal coaching with alter- native approaches (informal coaching and no coaching), addressing implications for practice (i.e. which approach is more effective?). In sum, this study offers theoretical and methodological insights for HRD academics and practical guidance for HRD practitioners.
