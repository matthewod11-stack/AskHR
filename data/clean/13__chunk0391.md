temporal variables (e.g., Farrell & McDaniel, 2001; Sturman, 2003), the examination of correlations between performance measures for various time lags (e.g., Deadrick & Madigan, 1990; Keil & Cortina, 2001; Sturman et al., 2005), and the application of new advances in research methods – latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) and hierarchical linear modeling – to analyze performance trends (Deadrick et al., 1997; Hofmann et al., 1992, 1993; Ployhart & Hakel, 1998; Sturman & Trevor, 2001). While research methodologies play an important role in any ﬁeld, there are particular conditions in the study of job performance and time that make it crucial to discuss certain methodological issues and problems. These include research design, analytical techniques, and the sort of statistical problems that necessarily accompany research in this area.
