# Performance Appraisal

2.

Severity -This "error," the opposite of leniency, occurs when the student rates the professor (and probably other professors) lower on every lizrn of the rating scale than the professor's true level of performance actually deserves.

3

Central tendency -This "error" occurs when the student uses only the central portion of the scale, ignoring the high and low extremes, even when the professor's true level of performance deserves an unusually high or low rating.

4

Extremity -This "error," the opposite of central tendency, occurs when the student uses only the high and low extremes of the scale, ignoring the central portion, even when the professor's true level of performance deserves a more moderate rating.

5

Halo --This "error" occurs when the student forms a general, overall Impression of the professor's performance, then fills out the rating form to reflect this impression. This practice should be avoided. Instead, the student rater should consider each item on the scale individually, and should try not to let his/her rating of the teacher on one item influence the rating on another hem.

6

Logical- -This "error," similar to the "halo error," occurs when the student, in an attempt to appear consistent, bases Ins/her rating on "logic" rather than observation, thus allowing his/her response to one scale item to unjustly Influence the response to another. As stated above, each item on the scale should be considered individually. A professor's level of performance will typically not be perfectly consistent (from item to item), thus there is no requirement that the student's rating of the professor be some- how logically consistent. What is imporunt is that the ratings reflect only the profes- sor's actual level of performance on each item.

7.

Proximity- -This "error," similar to the two above, occurs when the student allows his/her rating on one item of the scale to influence the rating on a second item simply because the two items are located close to one another on the scale. Again, each item should be considered independently.

8

Contrt.st and comparison- -These "errors" occur when the student rates his professor not according to the standards specified on the scale, but in contrast or comparison to sonic other kind of standard, such as the performance of the best or worst professor the stujen. his c 'en known, the level of performance the student thinks he/she could attain if he/she were teaching the course, etc. Each professor should be evaluated indepen- dently according to the standards speared on the rating scale, not in comparison with other teachers, ideals, etc
