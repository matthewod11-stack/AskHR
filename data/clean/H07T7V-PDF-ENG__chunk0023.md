## free-ﬂowing, argumentative, autonomous, evidence-driven, and pretty

egalitarian. That’s the goal of the geek way.

Now you point out some of these companies that I do think follow the

geek way that are still too pale, stale, and male. That’s absolutely true.

The evidence is pretty clear on this. I hope that gets better over time.

But Adi, you said something that I disagree with, that a lot of these

cultures that are not good places to work. That’s true in some cases.

Remember when LinkedIn did its top attractors survey, I believe in

2016, they said, look, we’re just going to look at objective criteria.

We’re going to look at which company pages get viewed the most often

by LinkedIn members. Which companies get the most interest from

LinkedIn members, the most applications, and where do people stick

around when they take their ﬁrst job?

The top 11 attractors in the LinkedIn list were all companies

headquartered on the West Coast in the industry that we loosely call

tech. The geek culture is an extremely attractive culture to work in.
