# meditation.

Reframe the situation. You can preempt or limit your fear response by

redeﬁning what uncertainty means for you and your organization in

the long term. Consider what pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic views

might look like. With this technique, you can fully acknowledge the

dangers you face while also tempering your reaction to them.
