# Outcomes of Allyship

Allyship can be a crucial diversity management tool for ending discrimination and achieving equal rights for oppressed groups in many ways. In this section, we will discuss previous research on the various ways allies have positive impacts on many aspects of the workplace. It should be noted that as this is a burgeoning field of research, there are less empirical tests of allies than of other workplace constructs. As more research attention is given to the topic, we expect a deeper empirical understanding of the phenomenon to emerge. However, it may always be a rela- tively under-studied topic compared to other workplace phenomena; the process through which allies affect others is complex, and it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when and how they have an effect on others. As discussed previously, much of what allies do goes beyond simply confronting others (which is somewhat easier to scientifically test); the general culture they create and impact this culture has may be less measurable. That being said, after reviewing previous research on the topic, we have identified three ways in which allies have a positive impact: their impact on other individuals, their impact on the culture in general, and the impact being an ally has on oneself.
