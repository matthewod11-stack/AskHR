Change As discussed in Chapter , a major contributor to organizational stress is change, which occurs most often from downsizing and restructuring ( Robinson & Griffiths, ). Realizing the amount of stress accompanying change, organiza- tions are placing increasing emphasis on workplace wellness by offering programs that teach employees how to cope with change and manage stress.

Relations with Others Our coworkers and customers can be a major source of workplace stress (see Chapter ). Though I don’t want to rehash material you learned in previous chapters, it is important to understand the stress associated with conflict, work- ing with difficult people, dealing with angry customers, and feeling that you are not being treated fairly. An employee I met at one organization provides a perfect example of this stress. The employee worked at a job she enjoyed, and her personal life was more fulfilling than it had been in years. Despite the positive aspects of her job and life, she had trouble sleeping, lacked energy, and was depressed. What was the source of these strains? A difficult coworker who constantly yelled, used sarcasm, and belittled everyone. Such a story is not unusual and demonstrates the important role that interpersonal relationships can play in causing stress. In fact, a study of more than , employees over a four-year period found that stress from interpersonal conflict at work resulted in a number of severe psychiatric problems (Romanov, Appelberg, Honkasalo, & Koskenvuo, ).

Organizational Politics Meta-analyses by Chang and Rosen () and Miller, Rutherford, and Kolodinsky () found that an important source of employee stress is the perceived use of organizational politics. Organizational politics are self-serving behaviors employees use to increase the probability of obtaining positive out- comes in organizations. Positive politics are behaviors designed to influence others with the goal of helping both the organization and the person playing the politics (Holden, ). Examples of positive politics include portraying a professional image, publicizing one’s accomplishments, volunteering, and complimenting others. Negative politics are manipulative behaviors designed to achieve personal gain at the expense of others and the organization (Holden, ). Examples of negative politics include backstabbing, withholding impor- tant information from others, and spreading rumors. In addition to increas- ing stress, negative organizational politics results in lower performance, lower levels of job satisfaction, and higher amounts of turnover (Chang & Rosen, ; Miller et al., ).

Stressors in the Physical Work Environment Noise If you have ever been upset when someone played a stereo too loudly while you were studying, then you can understand why psychologists are interested in studying the effects of workplace noise on employee stress. If the “obvious” were true, we could start and end our discussion of noise by stating that high levels of noise increase stress, reduce performance, and make workers unhappy. But as Figure . shows, the relationship between noise and worker behavior is much more complicated than we might first think.
