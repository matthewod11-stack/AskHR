# Strategies That Anyone Can Use

The following steps can help anyone support their mental health at

work, whether they deal with a condition chronically, occasionally,

or somewhere in between. These strategies also work for people

who have subclinical problems (for example, a degree of anxiety

but not enough to have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder)

or people seeking to increase their resilience against mental health

difﬁculties or relapses. If you have an active mental illness, including

high-functioning depression or anxiety, note that self-care and time

management aren’t substitutes for actual evidence-based treatments.

The strategies mentioned here are supportive; they are not treatments.
