# Limitations

Our data was collected using a self-reported instrument, at a single point in time, from employees only, not the supervisors who do the coaching. Whilst this practice is common in workplace coaching research (Dahling et al., 2016), it introduces the risk of common method variance, a systematic error which can may affect reliability and validity of results (Podsakoff et al., 2012). Also, we captured formal coaching events only, so cannot say whether participants also received informal coaching or not. Certainly, the literature acknowledges informal coaching (see Dixey, 2015; Grant, 2017), but its unstructured, spontaneous nature makes informal coaching challenging to measure accurately. Therefore, we deliberately focused on estimating differences in work-related outcomes between those who received formal coaching versus those who did not.
