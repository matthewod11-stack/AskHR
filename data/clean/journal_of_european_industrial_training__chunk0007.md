Employees want to know how well they perform on their jobs. A simple statement, almost axiomatic in any organisation, yet it has probably caused more controversy, applied research and practical advice than any other assertion in the history of management writing and thinking. The riddle is that both applied scientists and managers have simply been unable to provide complete feedback about job performance that satisfies an employee's need to know how well he/she has done and where to improve (Kavanagh, 1997, p. 147).

Kavanagh's (1997) statement shapes the focus and structure of this monograph. He refers to the idea of employees wanting to know how they are performing; the issue of how best to provide effective feedback to employees; and the challenge of providing feedback to employees which facilitates both performance improvement and effective career development processes. A relatively recent development in this context is a concept that has been termed ``3608 feedback'' or ``multi-rater performance appraisal''. Coates (1998) claims that multi-source appraisal became popular on the corporate scene only in the 1980s and at the time was mostly used as an executive development tool.
