## DeNisi and Kluger (2000) herald that, for

scholars and practitioners in the field of human resource management in general, it is widely accepted that feedback is an essential component of an effective performance improvement strategy. Furthermore, commentators argue that performance feedback increases job satisfaction and motivation (see Hackman and Oldham, 1980) and many decision-making and career development models include a feedback loop emphasising that individuals learn on the basis of receiving feedback on their performance (DeNisi and Kluger, 2000). Thus, performance feedback plays an important

role in numerous organisational activities such as career development, motivation, job satisfaction, and performance management. It seems important then that such a globally employed phenomenon is fully understood. 3608 or multi-rater feedback is one of the vehicles that is used to facilitate performance feedback and therefore deserves attention at an academic and practitioner level.

The monograph presents a review of the current research on the nature and value of 3608 feedback and considers issues central to the implementation of 3608 feedback in organisations. The first section defines the 3608 feedback process, traces its development within the literature and practice of HRM/ HRD, reports on the usage of 3608 feedback by organisations, focuses on how it differs from traditional top-down appraisal and details the key components of a 3608 feedback process. This section also gives some consideration to the alternative models that may be used by organisations to design a 3608 feedback system, discusses the benefits and limitations of 3608 feedback in performance management and career development contexts and concludes by focusing on the possible applications of a 3608 feedback process.

The second section considers the central issue of raters in the 3608 feedback process. It focuses on three rating sources in particular: upward feedback provided by subordinates, peer feedback and self-appraisal. The contemporary debates in respect of each of these sources of feedback are discussed and specific attention is given to the limitations and potential biases of these rating sources. The final section considers the implications of the research findings for practice in the context of the performance management process and employee development practices in organisations.
