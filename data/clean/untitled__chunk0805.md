## Cattell’s Operationalization of Galton’s Theory

James McKeen Cattell brought many of Galton’s ideas across the ocean to the United States. As head of the psychological laboratory at Columbia University, Cattell was in a good po- sition to publicize the psychophysical approach to the theory and measurement of intelligence. Cattell (1890) proposed a series of 50 psychophysical tests. Four examples were:

- 1. Dynamometer pressure. The dynamometer-pressure test measures the pressure resulting from the greatest possible squeeze of one’s hand.

- 2. Sensation areas. This test measures the distance on the skin by which two points must be separated in order for them to be felt as separate points. Cattell suggested that the back of the closed right hand between the ﬁrst and sec- ond ﬁngers be used as the basis for measurement.

- 3. Least noticeable difference in weight. This test measures least noticeable differences in weights by having partici- pants judge weights of small wooden boxes. Participants were handed two such boxes and asked to indicate which was heavier.

- 4. Bisection of a 50-cm line. In this test, participants were required to divide a strip of wood into two equal parts by means of a movable line.
