# Intelligence as Energy and Sensitivity

The publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859) had a profound impact on many lines of scientiﬁc endeavor. One was the investigation of human intelligence. The book sug- gested that the capabilities of humans were in some sense continuous with those of lower animals and hence could be understood through scientiﬁc investigation.

Galton (1883) followed up on these notions to propose a theory of the “human faculty and its development.” Because he also proposed techniques for measuring the “human fac- ulty,” his theory could be applied directly to human behavior. Galton proposed two general qualities that he believed distinguish the more from the less intellectually able. His epistemological rooting, therefore, was in the individual- differences approach. The ﬁrst quality was energy, or the capacity for labor. Galton believed that intellectually gifted individuals in a variety of ﬁelds are characterized by remark- able levels of energy. The second general quality was sensi- tivity. He observed that the only information that can reach us concerning external events passes through the senses and that the more perceptive the senses are of differences in lumines- cence, pitch, odor, or whatever, the larger would be the range of information on which intelligence could act. Galton’s manner of expression was direct:

The discriminative facility of idiots is curiously low; they hardly distinguish between heat and cold, and their sense of pain is so obtuse that some of the more idiotic seem hardly to know what it is. In their dull lives, such pain as can be excited in them may lit- erally be accepted with a welcome surprise. (p. 28)

For seven years (1884–1890), Galton maintained an an- thropometric laboratory at the South Kensington Museum in London where, for a small fee, visitors could have them- selves measured on a variety of psychophysical tests. What, exactly, did these kinds of tests look like?

One such test was weight discrimination. The apparatus consisted of shot, wool, and wadding. The cases in which they were contained were identical in appearance and dif- fered only in their weights. Participants were tested by a

sequencing task. They were given three cases, and with their eyes closed, they had to arrange them in proper order of weight. The weights formed a geometric series of heaviness, and the examiner recorded the ﬁnest interval that an exami- nee could discriminate. Galton suggested that similar geo- metric sequences could be used for testing other senses, such as touch and taste. With touch, he proposed the use of wire- work of various degrees of ﬁneness, whereas for taste, he proposed the use of stock bottles of solutions of salt of vari- ous strengths. For olfaction, he suggested the use of bottles of attar of rose mixed in various degrees of dilution.

Galton also contrived a whistle for ascertaining the high- est pitch that different individuals could perceive. Tests with the whistle enabled him to discover that people’s ability to hear high notes declines considerably as age advances. He also discovered that people are inferior to cats in their ability to perceive tones of high pitch.

It is ironic, perhaps, that a theory that took off from Darwin’s theory of evolution ended up in what some might perceive as a predicament, at least for those who subscribe to the notion that evolutionary advance is, in part, a matter of complexity (Kauffman, 1995). In most respects, humans are evolutionarily more complex than cats. Galton’s theory, how- ever, would place cats, which are able to hear notes of higher pitch than humans, at a superior level to humans, at least with respect to this particular aspect of what Galton alleged to be intelligence.
