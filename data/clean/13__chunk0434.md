# Reﬁning Stage Models of Job Performance

Hopefully, progress can be made in understanding the structure of job performance over time and the processes involved in its modeling, but the ﬁeld needs to understand the predictors and moderators of performance trends to better achieve the goal of understanding and affecting job performance over time. The Murphy and Ackerman models suggest that contextual factors can inﬂuence the nature of performance over time. In particular, both models mention job complexity, which other research has shown to be an important moderator of job performance predictors (e.g., Schmitt et al., 1984; Sturman, 2003; Sturman et al., 2005; Tubre & Collins, 2000). Unfortunately, the stage models are still relatively undeveloped in terms of their speciﬁc predictions. Addressing the research questions already articulated above will help identify the variables that should be included in revisions of the models. As more variables are included in these models, theoretical development of these models should follow so as to address how the newly speciﬁed variables relate to job performance over time. It will also be important to clearly distinguish between the Ackerman and Murphy models, or perhaps further adapt them for the speciﬁc purpose of predicting job performance. A weakness of Ackerman’s and Murphy’s models is that they both have simplistic treatments of performance (task
