## Managerial Coaching on Employee Performance and OCB

- 4. Results

Correlations, means and standard deviations are presented in Table 2. Correlation coefficients were lower, so there is no any problem regarding multicollinearity (<0.70; Tabachnick & Fidell, 1996). Results showing that managerial coaching is significantly correlated with thriving at work (r = 0.401, p < .01), in-role job performance (r = 0.482, p < .01), OCB-I (r = 0.250, p < .01), and OCB-O (r = 0.138, p < .01). When managers provide coaching to their employees, then they feel thrive in their work and return enhance their performance. Thriving at work is significantly correlated with in-role performance (r = 0.525, p < .01), OCB-Individual (r = 0.381, p < .05), and OCB-Organization (r = 0.533, p < .01). When people feel thrive in their work setting, then they perform better and do their work activities efficiently and effectively and perform beyond their routine duties for the organization. These correlations provide initial support to the hypothesis of this study.
