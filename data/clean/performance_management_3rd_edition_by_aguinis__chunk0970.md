# 6.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF APPRAISAL FORMS

We should be aware that there is no such thing as a universally correct appraisal form. In some cases, a form may emphasize competencies and ignore results. This would be the case if the system adopted a behavior approach as opposed to a results approach to measuring performance. In others, the form may emphasize developmental issues and minimize or even completely ignore both behaviors and results. In such cases, the form would be used for developmental purposes only and not for administrative purposes. One size does not fit all, and different components are appropriate based on the pur- poses of the appraisal.

In spite of the large variability in terms of format and components, there are

certain desirable features that make appraisal forms particularly effective:

- Simplicity. Forms must be easy to understand, easy to administer, quick to com- plete, clear, and concise. If forms are too long, convoluted, and complicated, it is likely that the performance assessment process will not be effective.

- Relevancy. Good forms include information related directly to the tasks and responsibilities of the job; otherwise, they will be regarded as an administrative burden and not as a tool for performance improvement.

- Descriptiveness. Good forms require that the raters provide evidence of perform- ance regardless of the performance level. The form should be sufficiently descriptive that an outside party (e.g., supervisorâ€™s supervisor or HR department) has a clear understanding of the performance information conveyed.
