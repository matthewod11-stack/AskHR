in admissions decisions was narrowly tailored and did not trammel the rights of nonminorities. In the Gratz case, however, the Court ruled that automatically giv- ing points to an applicant because of his or her race was not narrowly tailored and thus was illegal. Taken together, the two cases reinforce previous case law that the legality of preferential hiring will be determined on a case-by-case basis and that the plan must be narrowly tailored and not trammel the rights of nonminorities.

Endpoint of the Plan The fifth and final criterion concerns setting an endpoint for the plan. That is, an affirmative action plan cannot continue indefinitely; it must end when certain goals have been obtained. For example, in Detroit Police Officers Association v. Coleman Young (), the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that an affirmative action plan that had been utilized for  years had resulted in its intended goal: % of the Detroit police department was minority. Continuing the plan would be ille- gal, reasoned the court, because it would now result in a substantial hardship on nonminority-group applicants. The court also reasoned that should the percent- age of minorities in the department drop in the future, the preferential hiring plan could be reinstated.
