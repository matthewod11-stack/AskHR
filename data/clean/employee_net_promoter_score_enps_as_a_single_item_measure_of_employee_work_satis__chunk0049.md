# Abstract

The goal of the article was to evaluate the pros and cons of using the eNPS indicator and its possi- ble adaptation in employee satisfaction surveys.

The author conducted 3 independent surveys on over 6500 employees in 3 different compa- nies. The eNPS results were correlated with questions concerning the general opinion about work and the employer.

The eNPS indicator was proven to highly correlate with items describing the general employee opin- ion about work satisfaction. The numerical value of the indicator itself is considered by the author as misleading due to asymmetry in the classification of positive and negative opinions.
