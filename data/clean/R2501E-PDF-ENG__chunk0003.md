Unlike a company, which can expand capacity to meet increasing

demand, a leader is constrained by nature: As they say, there are

only so many hours in a day. Many people think they can increase

their productivity by working harder. But that, in due course, is a

losing game. They tire, their overall output falls, and they risk burning

themselves out and choosing to exit.
