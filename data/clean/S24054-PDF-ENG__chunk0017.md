## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

Good team leaders go further and ﬁnd ways of recognizing those who

don’t play on the ﬁeld yet support us in less visible ways. Football teams

have big support staﬀs—trainers, the people who prepare our meals and

clean the locker room and wash our uniforms, among others. I found

that a simple high ﬁve or word of appreciation means so much. To be a

great team, everyone needs to feel valued—and it’s up to the leaders of

the team to make sure that happens.

Set the standard and create a culture of 100% effort. During my early

seasons with the Patriots, I was part of a group of players called the

“Edgers.” We were constantly competing to get the edge on one another:

who could get to the weight room earlier, watch more game ﬁlm, do

more extra practice—even something as silly as who could drink the

most water. People assume that the coaches made sure we were putting

in the work, but in this culture, we were holding ourselves to a higher

level of accountability. I remember practices where the coach would tell

us we needed to run 20 wind sprints, each under seven seconds, with a

30-second break after each one. I’d stand up and say, “No, guys, we’re

doing 24 sprints, six seconds each, with 15-second breaks in between.”

(Remember, I was the slowest guy on the team.) Some of the players

would start arguing and yelling. I’d tell them: “I don’t give a f— what the

coach says.” We needed to work harder because it mattered to us, not

just give enough eﬀort to satisfy the coach.

In the NFL, every player thinks he’s giving 100% eﬀort. Judging from

what I saw, a lot of them are playing at only 70% or 80% of their true

ability. They may not realize it, but they’ve been conditioned to do that.

Putting in less than 100% eﬀort is particularly common for players on

teams that don’t win very often. Imagine being a star running back on a

bad team. Your team loses most of its games, and soon you ﬁnd yourself

giving less than your full eﬀort. But because you’re the best player,

you’re rewarded with a huge contract. In theory the money should
