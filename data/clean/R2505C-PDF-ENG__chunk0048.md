## as citizens, employees, or leaders—as well as their obligations to

others, making them feel more duty bound to act. The brave leaders

I encountered often had great mentors they could turn to in moments

of struggle. Others were able to ﬁnd courage by simply imagining what

their allies expected they would accomplish.

Consider Nair, who was the chief human resources oﬃcer of Unilever

before taking the helm of Chanel. She told me that when people

questioned her competence as a woman in the workplace or as an

HR (that is, “soft skills”) leader, she would remember the conﬁdence

that female family members, whose own ambitions had been stiﬂed,

instilled in her. “They would say things like, ‘Let Leena get the

opportunity. She’s intelligent. She’s talented.’” She also told me about

a conversation she had with her longtime mentor, Nooyi, about a new

job Nair felt she wasn’t ready for. The former PepsiCo CEO advised her

to think not about her limitations but about the key strengths she could

bring to the role, which gave Nair the push she needed to take it.
