- 2. Communicate strategically and with intention. The most critical

factor to success when you’re behind a screen is ensuring your

communication is written to inspire action. First, consider your

timing. Whether you’re sending a pitch, catching up on email, or

sending updates on projects, make sure you’re considering where your

colleagues are. Just because you don’t mind emailing after hours doesn’t mean others do or can. Or perhaps you are in a diﬀerent time

zone. Send or schedule your emails to be delivered within your shared

working hours to increase your odds of real-time response.

Second, your words need to connect with the reader. That begins with

understanding who you are addressing. Often, people forget to consider

their audience. They focus on what they want to say and ignore who

is on the other side. Do some research to understand the recipient’s

experience or point of view. If you are pitching an idea, it is always

beneﬁcial to understand what has been done before and what they

might be looking for.

When setting expectations, make sure your words are backed by action.

Accurately assess your capabilities and deliver on that. Or better yet,

exceed expectations. Make your words mean something.
