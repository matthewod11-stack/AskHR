# Boost Team Participation in Meetings

Low participation in meetings can harm your team’s productivity by

reducing collaboration, hampering decision-making, and eroding unity.

How can you encourage more fruitful engagement?

Start by clarifying expectations. Outline the supportive behaviors you

want to see in your meetings. For example, you could say, “As a team, we

support each other, we tackle challenges together, and we communicate

constructively.”

Model these behaviors yourself, and be sure to celebrate when your

team members do the same. For example, you might say, “I would

like to recognize something. Alex, the way you just acknowledged

Jordan’s contribution embodies the supportive culture we want to have

on our team—one where every team member’s input is recognized

and appreciated. Alex, thank you for demonstrating this and setting a

positive example for us all.”

It’s also helpful to oﬀer team members diﬀerent ways to contribute—for

example, allow for written input before, during, or after meetings. And

consider rotating the meeting facilitation among all team members to

give everyone a chance to lead. Giving those who are typically less vocal

a structured role can help empower them to speak.
