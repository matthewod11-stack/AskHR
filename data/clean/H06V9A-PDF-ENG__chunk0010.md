# reward employees for those ideas.

Of course, this is not to suggest that managers shouldn’t invite their

employees to contribute ideas. Explicitly soliciting input is a great

way to gather new, innovative ideas from employees who might not

otherwise feel comfortable or conﬁdent enough to speak up. But our

research illustrates how it can also make managers less likely to reward

employees for speaking up, and thus potentially reduce employees’

motivation to continue sharing their ideas.
