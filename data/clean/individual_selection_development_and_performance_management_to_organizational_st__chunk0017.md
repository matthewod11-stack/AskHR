# Developing Competency Models to Promote Integrated Human Resource Practices â€¢ 313

future trends and work conditions of an oc- cupational group, including projected future roles and job requirements. All KSAs, compe- tencies, and tasks found in the literature re- view are compiled into a database. For ex- ample, over 10,000 tasks and 500 KSAs were collected for the clerical and technical study. This information is then sorted by key words to create competencies and tasks that cover the work performed by all the occupations in the study and that eliminate redundancy and confusion in terminology. After draft lists of competencies and tasks are developed, the lists are reviewed and finalized by focus groups comprised of subject matter experts. The fi- nal lists (e.g., 170 tasks and thirty-one com- petencies for seventy-seven clerical and tech- nical jobs) comprise the common language for the occupational group under study.
