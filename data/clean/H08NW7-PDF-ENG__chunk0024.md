## HBR / Digital Article / When You Oversell Your Abilities and It Backfires

You might say something like, “I used to think of myself as an expert in

[X], but working with truly skilled people has been a wake-up call. I still

have a lot to learn.” This shows humility and a commitment to personal

growth. As a leader, it also role models for others, making it safe for

them to acknowledge their shortfalls rather than covering mistakes or

avoiding asking for help.

Redirect the spotlight.

Display genuine humility by highlighting the talents of others,

especially those with abilities stronger than yours. If you embellished

because you craved recognition or felt threatened by some imagined

comparison to others, say something like, “I used to think I had a special

talent for [X], but seeing what you can do has been really inspiring. I’d

love to learn from you.”

. . .

The pressure to appear perfect is strong in a world drunk on unhealthy

comparisons, humble-bragging, and inﬂated self-importance. But true

conﬁdence and success come from developing actual skills and growing

your talents over time. Internalize your ability to become self-aware,

which starts by understanding what others think of you, including

your expertise and potential. Instead of pretending, focus on progress,

learning, and authenticity—it will serve you and those around you

better in the long run. And if you have to pretend, then at least there

will be some substance to your embellishments.
