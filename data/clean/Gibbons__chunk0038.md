[On September 23, 1999, NASA lost the Mars Climate Orbiter. Not to
cosmic radiation or equipment failure, but to something far more
mundane: one team used metric units while another used imperial. The
\$327 million spacecraft burned up in the Martian atmosphere because
nobody stepped back to think about how they were thinking.]{.underline}

[The investigation revealed something more troubling than the unit
mismatch. Team members had noticed trajectory discrepancies. They\'d
seen warning signs. But they never engaged in what cognitive scientists
call metacognition --- thinking about their thinking. They never asked:
\"What assumptions are we making? How confident should we be? What might
we be missing?\"]{.underline}

[Today, as we rush to integrate AI into every aspect of work, we\'re at
risk of making the same mistake on a civilization scale. We\'re so
focused on what AI can do that we\'re forgetting to think about how we
think alongside it. Yet metacognition --- this uniquely human ability to
observe and direct our own cognitive processes --- might be our greatest
advantage in the AI era.]{.underline}

[And here\'s the twist: AI systems, properly engaged, can become
powerful partners in developing our metacognitive abilities. Not as
tools we use, but as thinking coaches that help us see our own minds
more clearly.]{.underline}
