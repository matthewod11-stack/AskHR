# Figure 1: ADA Compliance Score by State

(cid:32)

Comparative analysis of the implementation of ADA in various states demonstrates that in addition to legislative ambitions, political ideology, financial ability, and cultural predispositions all contribute to the lived conditions of disabled employees. Although the ADA offers a consistent legal base, its implementation and practice are extremely local (Buchter, 2025). The difference between policy and practice should be bridged not just with the strong federal oversight but with the political will and the infrastructural potential of states and municipal jurisdictions. Reform efforts must be based on the best practices of the states with high compliance rates, especially regarding outreach efforts to rural areas, legal education, and workplace innovation.
