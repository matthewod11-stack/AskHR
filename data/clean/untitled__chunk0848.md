# Evaluation

The information-processing approach to understanding intel- ligence has been very productive in helping to elucidate the

nature of the construct. First, it has been uniquely successful in identifying processes of intelligent thinking. Second, it has not been bound to individual differences as a source of determining the bases of human intelligence. It can detect processes, whether or not they are shared across individuals. Third, it is the approach that seems most conducive to the use of conventional experimental methods of analysis, so that it is possible to gain more control in experimentation by the use of these methods than by the use of alternative methods.

The approach has also had its weaknesses, though. First, in many cases, information-processing psychologists have not been terribly sensitive to individual differences. Second, information-processing psychologists often have been even less sensitive to contextual variables (see Neisser, 1976; R. J. Sternberg, 1997). Third, although information-processing analyses are not subject to the rotation dilemma, it is possible to have two quite different models that nevertheless account for comparable proportions of variation in the response-time or error-rate data, thereby making the models indistinguish- able. In other words, difﬁculties in distinguishing among models can plague this approach every bit as much as they can plague psychometric models (Anderson, 1983). Finally, the approach simply never produced much in the way of use- ful tests. Even more than a quarter of a century after its initi- ation, the approach has little to show for itself by way of useful or at least marketable products. Perhaps this is because it never worked quite the way it was supposed to. For exam- ple, R. J. Sternberg (1977) and R. J. Sternberg and Gardner (1983) found that the individual parameter representing a regression constant showed higher correlations with psycho- metric tests of abilities than did parameters representing well-deﬁned information-processing components.
