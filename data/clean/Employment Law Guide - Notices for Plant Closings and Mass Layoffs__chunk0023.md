WARN protects workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to provide notiﬁcation 60 calendar days in advance of plant closings and mass layoﬀs. Advance notice gives workers and their families some transition time to adjust to the prospective loss of

employment, to seek and obtain other jobs and, if necessary, to enter skill training or retraining that will allow these workers to compete

successfully in the job market. WARN also provides for notice to state dislocated worker units so that they can promptly oﬀer dislocated

worker assistance.
