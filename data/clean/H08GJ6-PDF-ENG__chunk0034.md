## robust discrimination of project attractiveness at the extremes. When

you are in the lucky spot of being able to fund almost all of few

proposals, scoring will serve you well. But if you aim to isolate the best

ﬁve of a few dozen proposals, go with ranking.

Big ﬁrms often already operate a sophisticated innovation process, have

experience with the winning products of the past but not the future,

and receive plenty more proposals than they can fund. Our decision tree

would thus lead them to the ranking decision rule, a simple collective

rule that strikes a balance between robustness and discrimination.

Scoring, which is discriminating but not robust, sometimes is a decent

second choice. Voting, although robust and well suited to screening tasks such as jury deliberations or medical diagnosis, insuﬃciently

discriminates between project options to enhance portfolio selection.
