## What Causes Employees to Be Satisfied with and Committed to Their Jobs?

This chapter will explore several theories that seek to explain why workers are satisfied with and committed to their jobs, but none of the theories completely explains these job-related attitudes. Each is valuable, however, because it suggests ways to increase employee satisfaction and commitment. Thus, even though a theory itself may not be completely supported by research, the resulting sugges- tions have generally led to increased performance or longer tenure.

Before discussing various theories, it is important to note that both of these work-related attitudes are multifaceted. That is, employees may be satisfied with one facet of work (e.g., their pay) but not another (e.g., their coworkers). The most commonly studied facets of job satisfaction are pay, supervision, coworkers, work, and promotion opportunities. Many other facets such as satisfaction with equipment, the work facility, the worksite, and company policy are also impor- tant but have not received as much research attention.

It is thought that there are three motivational facets to organizational com- mitment (Meyer & Allen, ). Affective commitment is the extent to which an employee wants to remain with the organization, cares about the organiza- tion, and is willing to exert effort on its behalf. For example, an employee of the Red Cross might like her coworkers and her boss, share the altruistic goals of the organization, and realize that her efforts will result in better organizational performance.

Continuance commitment is the extent to which an employee believes she must remain with the organization due to the time, expense, and effort that she has already put into it or the difficulty she would have in finding another job. Take, for example, a chamber of commerce director who spent ten years making business contacts, getting funding for a new building, and earning the trust of the local city council. Though she could take a new job with a chamber in a different city, she would need to spend another ten years with that chamber just to make the gains she has already made. As another example, an employee might hate her job and want to leave, but realizes that no other organization would hire her or give her the salary she desires.

Normative commitment is the extent to which an employee feels obli- gated to the organization and, as a result of this obligation, must remain with the
