# Serendipity Is a Three-Step Process

While it is sometimes confused with luck, serendipity is a process that

involves three steps. Let’s look at how it worked in the case of LASIK:

- 1. An unexpected event happens.

In 1993, several graduate students were working in Mourou’s lab at the

University of Michigan. Detao Du was one of them. One evening, he

forgot to put on his safety glasses while he was adjusting the mirrors of

a femtosecond laser. One of his eyes was accidentally hit by the beam of

the laser. Du was immediately taken to the hospital to make sure his eye

had not been damaged.

- 2. Someone sees value in the unexpected event.

Once in the hospital, Du was examined by Ron Kurtz, the

ophthalmologist on duty. While there was no damage to his eye, Kurtz

noticed several unusual burns in his retina. As he recalls: “When we

dilated his eye, what I saw was… retinal burns in the very center of his

retina. But these were unique in that they were very small and very

precise. I was curious as to what kind of laser this was and learned what

a femtosecond laser was.”
