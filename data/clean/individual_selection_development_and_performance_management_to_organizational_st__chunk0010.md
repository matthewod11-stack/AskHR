# Developing Competency Models to Promote Integrated Human Resource Practices • 311

ample, OPM compared its competencies to those representing emotional intelligence (Goleman, 1998). While OPM’s model cov- ered the majority of this work, small gaps were identified that will be incorporated into fu- ture work. Continually examining new com- petency models ensures that OPM develops comprehensive competency descriptions that cover a wide range of occupations.

OPM envisioned a uniform, competency- based common language that would enable federal agencies to describe jobs in the same way, eliminating inconsistencies across agen- cies and HR functions (e.g., staffing, perfor- mance appraisal, training). The common language reduces the costs of developing in- dependent, and often redundant, models within the federal government. Consistently defined competencies promote a common understanding of the critical elements of each job among HR personnel, management, and employees. OPM has found that this common language is applicable for a broad range of public-sector organizations, including state and municipal governments.

Competencies provide a common lan- guage across HR functions; therefore, they provide a natural foundation for integrating these functions. OPM has conducted federal governmental job analyses that lay the foun- dation for public-sector competency models for many occupations.
