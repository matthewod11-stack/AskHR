# 11 EXPLORING EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS IN SEARCH FUND–ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

sewage into public areas.34 Similarly, the case of Brian P. Johnson, a former systems administrator, underscores the importance of immediate de-credentialing. Johnson retained access to an industrial facility’s systems post-termination, using it to disrupt operations—a reminder of how insider threats can stem from incomplete offboarding procedures.35

Beyond operational risks, as discussed, terminations can profoundly affect team morale and organizational culture. Employees often look to how terminations are handled as an indicator of company values. An empathetic and humane approach can maintain trust within the team, whereas mishandling the process can damage morale and productivity.36

Managing employee terminations effectively requires safeguards to minimize risks to both the organization and the departing individual. Significant strategies include utilizing separation agreements and maintaining thorough legal documentation. Non-compete agreements, where applicable, address future employment limitations and help protect company interests by clarifying contractual obligations. Additionally, meticulous documentation of the termination process, including performance reviews and disciplinary records, reduces the risk of wrongful termination claims and supports the employer’s decision if disputes arise.

For organizations seeking additional support, Professional Employment Organizations (PEOs) offer specialized HR services that can streamline and standardize termination procedures. As depicted in the film Up in the Air, third-party experts manage complex aspects of employee separations, bringing both expertise and objectivity to the process. While dramatized in the movie, the role of professional guidance reflects real- world solutions that many companies rely on to navigate terminations professionally and legally.

PEOs ensure compliance with federal and state labor laws, assuming joint liability for compliance issues and helping employers avoid legal disputes. They prepare and organize critical documentation, such as termination letters and separation agreements, to safeguard businesses. For challenging situations involving discrimination claims or Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodations, PEOs provide expert guidance to minimize risks and ensure fairness.37

Beyond the termination meeting, PEOs handle post-termination tasks, including issuing final paychecks, terminating benefits, and processing COBRA notifications. Some even offer outplacement services to help former employees transition to new roles, reducing potential animosity and preserving goodwill.38

For smaller ETA businesses, partnering with a PEO can be transformative. Businesses gain access to advanced HR expertise and legal protections at a fraction of the cost of maintaining an in-house HR team. This support allows leaders to focus on strategic priorities while ensuring that terminations are handled with professionalism and compliance. 39
