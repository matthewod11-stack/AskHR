the ``process of having the members of a group judge the extent to which each of their fellow group members has exhibited specified traits, behaviours or achievements''. Saavedra and Kwun (1993, p. 450) suggest that ``peer ratings are obtained by having each member of a work group rate each other's performance using a specific rating scale''.

Kane and Lawler (1978) enumerate three

methods of peer assessment: 1 peer nominations; 2 peer ratings; and 3 peer rankings.

Peer nomination involves having each member of the group designate a specified number of group members as being the highest in the group on a particular characteristic or dimension of performance. Peer rating consists of having each group member rate each other group member on a given set of performance or personal characteristics using a rating scale. Peer ranking occurs where group members rank each other from best to worst on one or more factors. Kane and Lawler (1978) conclude that the peer appraisal research findings are generally encouraging with respect to reliability, validity and freedom from biases of each of the assessment methods. This section of the monograph considers peer feedback, focusing particularly on the impact of purpose of peer feedback, employee acceptance of peer ratings and the effect of peer feedback on subsequent ratee performance. The next section briefly reviews the factors that have led to the growth and development of peer appraisal systems. The various advantages and disadvantages of peer appraisals are also set out in this section.

Growth and development of peer appraisal Recent trends in the increased use of team- working arrangements has contributed significantly to a shift in performance appraisal practices in organisations (Fedor et al., 1999). Church (1998) suggests areas in which teamwork has been a central component in recent years. These include the identification of corporate values, the formation of strategic objectives, as a criterion for assessing senior leadership, as an initiative used in delayering and re- engineering projects and as a dimension for multi-rater feedback.

Fedor et al. (1999) argue that, with an

increased emphasis on teamwork and flatter organisation structures, supervisors are no longer the best judges of performance. A significant development in the area of

teamworking is the adoption of self-managed work groups in organisations. Numerous authors highlight that these arrangements play an important part in the success and effectiveness of organisations (Dominick et al., 1997; Peters, 1996). Successful teams depend greatly on effective interaction among team members. The effective transition to a team-based organisation can be facilitated by interventions designed to promote behaviours that are necessary for effective teamwork (Dominick et al., 1997). Behaviourally-based peer feedback is an intervention that can be used to enhance behaviour in team settings.

While self-managed teams promise many benefits to the organisation (for example, the elimination of a layer of supervisory management), they are also a cause of concern in other respects. Saavedra and Kwun (1993) maintain that organisations face difficult decisions about how to manage and monitor self-managing teams. Druskat and Wolff (1999) point out that an issue of major concern in this respect is how to appraise team member performance and facilitate employee development in work arrangements where there is no supervisor held responsible for the performance management process.

The use of peer appraisal has stemmed from these issues and is now viewed as a logical and even necessary addition to the structure of team self-management (Druskat and Wolff, 1999; Rogers, 1995; Mohrman et al., 1989). Druskat and Wolff (1999, p. 58) go on to argue that ``peer appraisals can increase group members' ability to be a proactive source of their own feedback ± a necessity for self-managed work groups that monitor and manage their own performance''.

Numerous commentators have expressed concern about top-down appraisal, arguing that supervisory ratings are a reflection of one view of performance from one perspective. It is also argued that supervisor- based appraisal systems do not capture many important employee behaviours such as helping and training co-workers and being good team players (Milliman et al., 1994; Wexley and Klimoski, 1984). Thus, the advent of self-managed teams, the increased focus on teamwork in organisations and concern about traditional top-down supervisory ratings have contributed to the rise in popularity of peer appraisal systems. According to Farh et al. (1991, p. 384), ``given the societal trend toward team-oriented, high-involvement work arrangements, peer appraisal is likely to play an increasingly important role in the future''.
