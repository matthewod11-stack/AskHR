# 394 Forensic Psychology

psychologists were regularly called as expert witness in such proceedings. Until this period, in cases involving the ques- tion of insanity, only licensed medical doctors were allowed to testify as experts. Finally, in 1940 the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in People v. Hawthorne that the trial court had erred in refusing to qualify as an expert a well-credentialed psychologist. The Court opined that a psychologistâ€™s ability to assess insanity should not be assumed to be inferior to that of a medical doctor (Bartol & Bartol, 1999).
