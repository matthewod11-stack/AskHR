## HBR / Digital Article / How Much Autonomy Should You Give Your Global Teams?

Importantly, this isn’t just a matter of the overall pace of an entire

market. While the Chinese market moves quickly in many industries,

executives should be sure to analyze the pace of the speciﬁc industry

in which their businesses operate. Sectors such as chemical engineering

and traditional manufacturing, for instance, grow relatively slowly and

experience fewer changes (even in a generally fast-paced market such as China). Companies in these sectors will be better oﬀ centralizing

decision-making in order to streamline operations and avoid costs associated with duplicating similar functions across diﬀerent teams.

For example, ExxonMobil has had a relatively stable customer base in

China for years, and has experienced minimal need for rapid product

development or other major changes. As such, its leadership decided

to keep business operations and structures fairly centralized, with most

key decision-making power remaining at the headquarters.

- 2. How much does your business depend on local assets?

Next, managers should consider the extent to which their business

depends on local assets. If a global company relies heavily on

capabilities such as local procurement, production, and sales,

decentralization is necessary. Global fast-food chain Yum! Brands serves

as a good example: When it launched Yum! China, it began sourcing,

producing, and selling more and more products in China, leading

headquarters to take a looser approach to management. Eventually, Yum! Brands even ended up spinning oﬀ its China division entirely,

letting it operate and be publicly traded as a separate company.

In contrast, for businesses that depend less on local assets, a higher

degree of centralization often makes more sense. For example, we

talked with executives at many American and European luxury brands

which have expanded into Middle Eastern markets to reach the

substantial customer bases in the region. These companies typically
