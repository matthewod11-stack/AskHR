ear plugs and muffs or working in soundproof areas away from the sources of noise. In one study, use of hearing protection devices in a noisy factory reduced workers’ hostile behaviors (Rabinowitz, Melamed, Feiner, & Weisberg, ). Although these methods may limit the effects on employee health, they may also decrease performance in jobs that require detection of or attention to certain types of noise (Mershon & Lin, ).

Another method used to limit the problem of noise has been through engi- neering technology—that is, by reducing the actual amount of noise emitted. For example, rubber pads on machines reduce noise by reducing vibration, and belt drives instead of gears reduce the noise made by many types of machines. In one study, using white noise to mask office noise improved performance on a cogni- tive task. However, the white-noise group still performed worse than the no-noise group (Loewen & Suedfeld, ). In offices, airflow from ventilation systems can serve as a source of white noise.

This discussion has concentrated on the potential harmful effects of noise, but noise can also be beneficial in the working environment, especially as a warn- ing method. For example, loud noises alert workers that a forklift is backing up, loud whistles tell workers when it is time to go home, and alarms tell workers when a machine has malfunctioned.
