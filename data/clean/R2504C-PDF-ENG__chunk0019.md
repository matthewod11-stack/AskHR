## HBR / Magazine Article / “Speed Is a Leadership Decision”

think really matter. And we tolerate failure. If you aren’t failing, you’re

either not inventing enough or not pushing the envelope.

I want to talk about leadership. As you say, AI is reshaping everything. And it feels as if there’s never been greater political and geopolitical complexity. How do you manage through all the uncertainty?

There are a lot of things happening now in the world, in our country.

And it can be dizzying. I think it’s important to acknowledge that there’s

a lot going on, but you can only control the things that you can control.

And then remember what matters most. We’re here to make customers’

lives easier and better. We could get distracted by questions like “Are

there going to be tariﬀs? How high will be they be?” But at the end of the

day, we have a job to do, which is to ﬁgure out what customers want and

then deliver it.

For years, in HBR and elsewhere, the consensus has been that good leadership was deﬁned in large part by being attuned to the needs of all your stakeholders, of thinking about issues like sustainability and diversity. Has the deﬁnition of good leadership changed in your mind?

disproportionate amount of attention. That’s because there’s still work

to be done. We’re still not where we need the environment to be. I

still think we want more-diverse teams. None of that has changed.

Sometimes those issues take up more of the conversation. But as a

leader, you have to create the right customer experience with the right

results to match it. The other pieces are parts of that.

You succeeded a very prominent and successful founder, Jeff Bezos. To what extent are you drawing from his legacy and to what extent are you advancing your own ideas and goals?

I was lucky to work for Jeﬀ directly for 20 years. He may be the most

impressive business leader of our generation. I share a lot of his values
