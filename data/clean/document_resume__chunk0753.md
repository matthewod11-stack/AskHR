There is a need for systematic, objective information regarding teaching performance.

For lack of more objecux e data, Important decisions are often made on the basis of the "informal evaluation" described above. As noted, much of this informal evaluation is based on hearsay, reputation, random comments and observations, etc. These sources are often inaccurate and even unfair They typically present a distorted, biased picture of the professor's true teaching ability and performance. In order to increase the possi- bilities of appropriate, unbiased, fair decisions being made, It is necessary to gather more objective, systematic,. relevant information about faculty teaching performance. Teacher rating forms are one means of making lanky evaluation more objective and systematic, and less biased.

One major problem with man) faculty rating forms is that they can be interpreted dif- ferently by each student neer. Thus, characteristics of the type of form used can influ- ence the outcome of a teacher evaluation project. Students do not always agree on the definition of "good teaching performance," and what one sees as "excellent" perfor- mance may be only "fair" to another. Since the outcome of the rating process can be as easily influenced by how the raters interpret the form as by the faculty member's actual teaching performance, it is important to make sure that all of the raters interpret the form as similarly as possible The teaching behaviors to be evaluated and the meaning of each point on the scale should he clearly specified to ensure nearly uniform inter- pretation Otherwise, the raters may all be rating different aspects of behavior, and the data will not be meaningful.

In order to be useful, faculty evaluation data must be reliable. That is, the evaluations by several independent raters of the same professor s teaching perfomiance in the same class should be relatively consistent- -there should be relativ,ly high agreement among the raters. If there is a very low rate of agreement among the raters, the Information will obviously be of little use.
