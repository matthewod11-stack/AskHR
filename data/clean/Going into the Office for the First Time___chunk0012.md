To avoid any mishaps, it’s best to check in with your boss aroundhow flexible or stringent the in-office culture is at yourorganization. The amount of face time you have in the office maynot be a big deal to one manager and may be a huge deal toanother. If your boss says it’s important to be at your desk by 8:30am, take their word for it.Other areas to pay attention to include:

Team and organizational meetings. Is it important to be in theroom a few minutes early? Should you always book aconference room or meet in more informal spaces? Will youneed a pad of paper, tablet, or computer to take notes?

Break times. How long do lunch breaks typically last? Howmany breaks do people take throughout the day? Do you needto let your manager or team members know when you’restepping out for an appointment? Is it okay to run quick errandsif they don’t disrupt your schedule?

Dress code. Is it more formal or casual? Are there certainmeetings, such as ones with external clients, where it’simportant to dress up? What footwear do you need to movearound comfortably?
