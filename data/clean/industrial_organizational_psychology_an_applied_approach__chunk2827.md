## Tactical Style in a Climate of Disorganization

A leader with a tactical style leads through the use of strategy and is most effective in a climate of disorganization. A good example is a class that breaks into small groups to complete an assignment. Ideally, every student knows the material well enough to complete the assignment, but normally there is a limited amount of time and too much work to do. The person who becomes the leader is the one who is best able to organize the group.

Becoming an Eff ective Leader According to IMPACT Theory If IMPACT theory is correct, people can become effective leaders by one of the four methods shown in Table .. The first is by finding a climate that is consistent with their behavioral style. This method, however, involves either a great deal of luck or a lot of patience, as the leader must be in the right place at the right time.

In the second method, leaders change their style to meet a particular climate. That is, if the climate is one of ignorance, individuals change their behavior and use information to lead. On the other hand, if the climate is one of despair, indi- viduals become more outgoing and positive. Thus, people who are willing to adapt their behavior and who have the ability to “play” each of the six leadership styles should be effective leaders.
