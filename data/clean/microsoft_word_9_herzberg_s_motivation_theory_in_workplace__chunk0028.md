## HERZBERG’S MOTIVATION THEORY IN WORKPLACE

five out of six motivational factors (mentioned by Herzberg) are significantly important for motivation and job satisfaction for the Nepalese employees. A significant correlation was found to exist in factors causing motivation and job satisfaction for U.S. and Nepalese respondents. The result showed that the factor which can motivate a worker does not depend much on the geographical condition or the ethnic group. The psychological thinking and expectation of human at work can be same irrespective of the cultural or ethnic difference.

Result of ranking the factors by male and female shows that a significant correlation exists between their rankings of factors causing motivation and job satisfaction. From the finding we can say that the need and wants of male and female at work is not much different. Both have ranked Salary as the most important factor for motivation. Both male and female respondents have ranked six factors with the same rank. That is, they ranked Salary, Possibility of Growth, Working Condition, Personal life, Relation with Supervisor, and Supervision- Technical as first, second, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and sixteenth respectively. The top six factors identified are Salary, Possibility of growth, Recognition, Achievement, Responsibility, and Advancement.

A significant correlation was found to exist between the ranking of factors causing motivation and job satisfaction between supervisors and non-supervisors. The top four motivational factors identified by both supervisor and non-supervisors are Salary, Achievement, Recognition, and Possibility of growth. From the finding we can say that the need and wants of supervisor and non-supervisors are not much different. Both the respondents’ groups have identified Salary to be the most important factor causing motivation and job satisfaction. Another result from the hypothesis shows that the type of motivational factor is independent of the type of organization. The factors which motivate a worker and cause them job satisfaction remain same irrespective of the organization type. The result revealed important psychology of the human regarding their needs which can motivate them to work. The respondents from all three different type of organizations marked Salary as the most important factor for their workplace motivation.
