## Step : Determine Who Will Evaluate Performance

Traditionally, employee performance has been evaluated solely by supervisors. Recently, however, organizations have realized that supervisors see only certain aspects of an employee’s behavior. For example, as shown in Figure ., a branch manager might observe only % of a teller’s work behavior; the rest is observed by customers, peers, and support staff in other parts of the bank. Furthermore, the teller might behave very differently around her supervisor than around other people. Consequently, to obtain an accurate view of the teller’s performance, these other sources should provide feedback. The buzzwords for using multiple sources to appraise performance are -degree feedback and multiple-source feedback. About % of large U.S. organizations use some form of multiple- source feedback (Mercer Consulting, ). A survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM, ) reported that -degree feedback was used by % of organizations for nonexempt positions, % for exempt positions, and % for executive-level positions. Sources of relevant information about employee performance include supervisors, peers, subordinates, customers, and self-appraisal. As shown in Table ., often there is little agreement in the way two supervisors evaluate an employee or a supervisor and a peer might rate an employee. Interestingly, supervisors whose self-ratings agree with others’ ratings tend to be better performers than supervisors whose rating are not consistent with those of others (Witt, ).
