�p < .05 ��p < .01 ���p < .001. The order of the letters refers to task, social, and external leadership, respectively. Groups’ interpretation notation: L = Low (zero and one leader), H = High (two and

three leaders). LLL (a) = Low Task, Low Social, Low External; HHH (b) = High Task, High Social, High External; HLL (c) = High Task, Low Social, Low External; LHH

(d) = Low Task, High Social, High External; LLH (e) = Low Task, Low Social, High External; HLH (f) = High Task, Low Social, High External; Balanced = equal number of leaders on each of the three roles. The values that reflect the best team functioning are presented in bold. The results of the Bonferroni post-hoc analysis are indicated

with the superscripts a-f, which reflect the significant difference between the different leadership structures.

The second step was run a MANOVA for male and female teams separately. The effectiveness of the task, social, and external leadership structures for male and female teams are presented in Tables 4, 5 and 6, respectively.
