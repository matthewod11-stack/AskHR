## HBR / Digital Article / Parents, Take Your Sick Days

not to work when we’re sick, period. That includes turning oﬀ email and

group chats. It was hard to stick to the ﬁrst time around (OK, I ruined it

for everyone), but after renewing the pledge more recently, we’ve been

able to stick to our plan, to everyone’s beneﬁt.

You may also want to communicate clearly with your partner about

making sure you take care of each other by encouraging self-care. For

instance, my wife and I let each other know when we would beneﬁt from

one of us taking a sick day — a concept that extends beyond simply not

working and includes a break from child care, errands, meal prep, and

so on. And if we’re both sick, we try to agree about who gets the ﬁrst day,

knowing that we will reverse roles next time.

Tell your kids about your routine, too, so they can learn early how to

value their own health. Be straightforward: “You know that I would like

to be able to work, but I’m not feeling well. It’s important to take time

to rest so that you can feel better.” (Yes, these words will come back to

haunt you when it’s time for school, but that’s okay.)

Finally, remember the larger picture. If this standard — serious self-

care — becomes the bar for everyone, then we’ll all be supporting one

another, at home and at work. That’s as it should be.

You won’t be able to perform your best at work or at home if you’re not

feeling well. Take the time you need to recuperate and care for yourself.

You owe it to yourself — and those around you.
