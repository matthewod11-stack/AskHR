The last two decades have seen South Korea emerge as a cultural

powerhouse on the global stage. K-pop groups like BLACKPINK and BTS

have become worldwide megastars, with the latter’s overall contribution

to South Korea’s economy estimated at US$5 billion, while TV series

Squid Game drew more than 111 million views worldwide within 30 days,

the biggest launch in Netﬂix’s history. The country steadily churns out

award-winning K-movies and K-dramas, boasts a shiny contemporary

art scene, and has the world’s fourth-largest gaming industry. And the

K-beauty market is expected to hit US$18.32 billion in revenue by 2030.
