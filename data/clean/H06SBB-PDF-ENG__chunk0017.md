# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

SANDY SPEICHER: Yeah, I guess what we see now is really about a

question of intentionality and every business is different, which means

that I think what we’re going to see is a lot more people designing what

their agreements are for how they want to work together.

For sure what we’ve all realized is that there is work that we can do from

all different types of environments. We can also build relationships in

different platforms, whether that’s physical or virtual. I almost made

up a word there combining them, but this year one of the things that

we’re really looking at is not just what’s the future of work where there’s

just one whole new way, but what are the many ways of working in

the future? At IDEO we call this FWOW, the Future Ways of Working,

because there are many, many different ways that we’ll be working. And

so, the office space becomes one of the things that we can design for

how we come together.

ADI IGNATIUS: I think you put your finger on what a lot of companies

are doing and that is really experimenting. We don’t really know what

we’re going to do in the future. I think most companies are saying,

“Well, we’re going to try something and then see how it goes.” From

your perspective, in terms of thinking about process, how do companies

design the best hybrid work model to learn from this experimentation

that’s going on?

SANDY SPEICHER: It’s such a good question because we risk right now

in the pressure of urgency, coming to new answers quite quickly or

thinking that we know what the best solution will be. When meanwhile,

times are really changing and people’s needs are changing. So there

is a lot of conversation out there about leaders and empathy and

how the role of the leader is really to listen and listen deeply right

now. Understand the needs of customers and also colleagues and use

that information to understand how to design the systems around us,
