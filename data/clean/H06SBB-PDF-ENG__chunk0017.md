# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

whether that’s the space or whether that’s our policies or whether that’s

our agreements for how we collaborate.

And of course, what you just said there around the word

experimentation, a good experiment is designed to teach us something.

And so how are we setting up those experiments knowing what we’re

looking to learn so that we can incorporate that and iterate on that over

time? This actually really requires a whole new dynamic relationship

across a workplace, and it’s quite exciting.

I think that as we see in the dynamics of the world today, everyone’s

really asking for an evolved relationship with work. That kind of

frame that you sort of have to be here 9:00 to 5:00, people are really

questioning that relationship, understanding that they can still be really

effective at their work, but have a lot more flexibility and agency in their

days. So really, I think the major principle that should underlie all of the

experiments that we’re doing right now is how does this allow people to

have increased agency, and how do we create a system to incorporate

the flexibility that people need as a result of that agency?

ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, I think agency is the number one issue. But it’s

tricky because if you ask your workforce, they may ask for 100% agency,

and by that they may mean, “I want to work from home 100% of the

time.” What do you do with that data? Who should take charge?

SANDY SPEICHER: I do think that people have many different needs

and many different experiences, and some people found a comfort and

effectiveness working from home and some people are really missing

being back in person together and some people are in between, really

wanting flexibility. So as leaders, a lot of our job is to incorporate all of

that information and understand how to design a shared system.
