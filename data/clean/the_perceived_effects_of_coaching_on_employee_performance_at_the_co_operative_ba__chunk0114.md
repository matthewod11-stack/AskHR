## 4.3.3(cid:32) Internal Business Processes Perspective

The results of the survey indicated an improvement in coacheeâ€™s skills, knowledge

and competencies. 87% of the respondents agreed that through coaching they are

able to identify their strengths and weaknesses. This removes the element of surprise

from performance reviews for coached employees who have already been apprised

of their strengths and weaknesses. Clearly, the stigma of coaching as a consequence

for poor performance is changing, as evidenced by the fact that almost as many

respondents view coaching as an engagement tool as they do a way to address

workplace problems. The respondents also agreed that they have been able to

acquire requisite skills, knowledge and competencies to enable them do their work.

Improvement in these skills and competencies are reflected in the efficiency of the

employees. These responses were captured in the questions 1B, 2B and 6B. The

analysis of the responses is shown in the figure 4.3.3 below.
