# Our approach: iterative development

OpenAI is organized around three teams. Our Research Team advances the foundations of AI, developing new models and capabilities. Our Applied Team turns those models into products, like ChatGPT Enterprise and our API. And our Deployment Team takes these products into companies to address their most pressing use casesV

We use iterative deployment to learn quickly from customer use cases and use that information to accelerate product improvements. That means shipping updates regularly, getting feedback, and improving performance and safety at every stepV

The result: users access new advancements in AI early and oftenâ€”and your feedback shapes future products and models.
