# What the Data Shows

We looked at data gathered since 2020 on 2,801 managers, who were

rated by 13,048 direct reports. On average, each manager was rated by

ﬁve direct reports, and we compared two data points:

- Employees’ ratings of their manager’s ability to “Balance getting

results with a concern for others’ needs”

- Employee’s ratings of the extent to which their “work environment is a

place where people want to go the extra mile”

The research term we give for those willing to give extra eﬀort is

“discretionary eﬀort.” Its eﬀect on organizations can be profound: If you

have 10 direct reports and they each give 10% additional eﬀort, the net

results of that additional eﬀort are increased productivity.
