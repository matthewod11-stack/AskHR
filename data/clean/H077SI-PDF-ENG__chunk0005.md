## HBR / Digital Article / Quiet Quitting Is About Bad Bosses, Not Bad Employees

The graph below shows the results. We found that the least eﬀective

managers have three to four times as many people who fall in the

“quiet quitting” category compared to the most eﬀective leaders. These

managers had 14% of their direct reports quietly quitting, and only 20%

were willing to give extra eﬀort. But those who were rated the highest

at balancing results with relationships saw 62% of their direct reports

willing to give extra eﬀort, while only 3% were quietly quitting.
