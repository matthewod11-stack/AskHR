## HBR / Digital Article / How to Manage an Employee Who Always Makes Excuses

your loss of faith is associated with their lack of oomph, emphasize their

obligation and clarify what’s at stake if they fail to deliver.

You have both carrot and stick options if you need to add a little

There’s one other motivation issue to prepare for; the person who starts

full of vim and vigor but throws up their hands at the ﬁrst hint of

adversity. In that case, your process should inoculate the person against

setbacks by preparing a plan B upfront. Spend some time anticipating

what could go wrong and creating a game plan. What issues do you

anticipate arising? How might they handle those types of problems? Be

sure to specify which circumstances warrant the person escalating to

you and which you’d expect them to tackle independently. Addressing

the contingencies and potential pitfalls will make it clear that you

expect the person to persevere.

When you articulate the consequences, you bolster the motivation.

If you’re managing a person who keeps letting you down and making

excuses for why it wasn’t their fault, don’t waste your energy hoping

they’ll miraculously become trustworthy. Instead, work through a

process that sets them up for success and removes the excuses in the

process. Then if the employee fails to deliver and falls back on the

“but, but, but…,” you’ve got all the fodder you need for a performance
