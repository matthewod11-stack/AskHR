Goals, in conjunction with self-efﬁcacy (task-speciﬁc con- ﬁdence; Bandura, 1997), often mediate or partially mediate the effects of other potentially motivating variables, such as per- sonality traits, feedback, participation in decision making, job autonomy, and monetary incentives.

Thekeymoderatorsofgoalsettingarefeedback,whichpeople need in order to track their progress; commitment to the goal, which is enhanced by self-efﬁcacy and viewing the goal as im- portant; task complexity, to the extent that task knowledge is harder to acquire on complex tasks; and situational constraints. With regard to the latter, Brown, Jones, and Leigh (2005) found that role overload (excess work without the necessary resources to accomplish a task) moderates goal effects; goals affected performance only when overload was low.

Goal-setting theory has high internal and external validity. As of 1990, support for goal-setting effects had been found on more than 88 different tasks, involving more than 40,000 male and female participants in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America (Locke & Latham, 1990). Goal effects have been found inbothlaboratoryandﬁeldsettings,usingbothcorrelationaland experimental designs and numerous dependent variables. Time spans have ranged from 1 minute to 25 years and effects have been obtained at the individual, group, and organizational-unit levels. Goals are effective even when they come from different sources; they can be assigned by others, they can be set jointly through participation, and they can be self-set. In the latter instance, goals are a key element in self-regulation. Goal theory
