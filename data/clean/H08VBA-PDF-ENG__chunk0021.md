- 5. Reward leaders who stop, not just those who start.

In most organizations, careers are built on launching new initiatives,

not ending them. High-performing companies change that narrative.

At a global luxury company I advised, the CEO added a new KPI to

senior leaders’ scorecards: resources freed from low-value initiatives.

Leaders had to publicly share, every quarter, which projects they had

stopped and how those resources were reinvested.

At ﬁrst, executives were skeptical. But within two cycles, the mood

shifted—leaders began competing to demonstrate their strategic

judgment. One senior executive proudly told me, “Stopping that big

IT project freed 15 engineers; they’re now accelerating our core digital

oﬀering. That’s the impact I want to be known for.”
