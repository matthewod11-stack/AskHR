Who created the NPS and why it became so popular?

The NPS was created by Frederick F. Reichheld2 who published in Harvard Busi- ness Review the text with convincing title: The One Number You Need to Grow3. Reichheld was ensuring his readers that: “you don’t need expensive surveys and complex statistical models. You only have to ask your customers one question”4. Having a good professional reputation5 and being sure of his research was prob- ably one reason of Reichheld’s success. The other reasons may be the simplicity of the NPS, the easiness in understanding for managers and the focus on business growth. The item created by Reichheld was even called “the ultimate question”6. There is much research confirming the success of the NPS in the business world. For example, in one piece of research, 71% of the large companies in the sample were using the NPS7 or another research showing that the majority of Customers Experience Directors use the NPS as one of the key indicators8.
