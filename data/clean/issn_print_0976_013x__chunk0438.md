# Sharma, and Joshi (2017) in their research highlight government banks' functional autonomy

and effective governance. Public banks' work environment, job performance, and well-being

were constantly and significantly superior. Private banks' work culture, requirements, and

hours suggest higher work strain, more acute job stress, and disregard for human issues.

Researchers, namely Lim, M. S., Kim, C. Y., & Yoo, J. W. (2020), first believed, depending on a

sampling of Korean manufacturing firms, as in a sector with significant isomorphic dynamics,

firms would be compelled by homogeneity to adhere to industry norms and standards. The

data also indicate that when the industry is dynamic, the favourable impacts of strategy

conformity and invention on firm success are diminished.
