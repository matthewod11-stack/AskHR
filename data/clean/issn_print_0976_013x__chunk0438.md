# METHODOLOGY

The author mainly used standardized questionnaires called OCTAPACE and the Normative

social influence scale. The OCTAPACE profiling is a 40-item questionnaire that provides eight-

valued profiling of an organization's ethos. Openness, autonomy, trust, confrontation,

proactivity, autonomy, authenticity, collaboration, and experimentation are measured

through the test. There are two parts to the instrument. In section I, items 1 through 24 (three

for each of the eight values) explain values, and the respondent is asked to indicate the degree

to which his organization values each item. Part 2 has 16 items on beliefs, two for each of the

eight values, and the respondent assesses the extent to which the organization shares each

belief. The Normative social influence scale is a six-item test that assesses a behaviour change

deemed essential for group membership. Conformity stems from our desire for positive

interactions with other individuals. Sixty responses were collected from diverse TCS and

Infosys workers. With the aid of a manual, scoring and interpretation were accomplished. The

t-test was used to compare research groups across multiple dimensions.
