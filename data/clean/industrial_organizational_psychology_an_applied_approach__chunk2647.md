# Interpersonal Communication

Interpersonal communication involves the exchange of a message across a communication channel from one person to another. As shown in Figure ., the interpersonal communication process begins with a sender encoding and transmitting a message across a communication channel (e.g., by memo, orally, nonverbally) and ends with another person (the receiver) receiving and decoding the message. Although this seems like a simple process, there are three main problem areas where things can go wrong and interfere with the accurate trans- mission or reception of the message.
