Table 3. An example of system prompting

System prompts can be useful for generating output that meets speci(cid:450)c requirements. The

name ‘system prompt’ actually stands for ‘providing an additional task to the system’. For example, you could use a system prompt to generate a code snippet that is compatible with

a speci(cid:450)c programming language, or you could use a system prompt to return a ce(cid:457)ain

structure. Have a look into Table 4, where I return the output in JSON format.
