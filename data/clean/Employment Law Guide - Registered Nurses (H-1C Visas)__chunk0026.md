# Administration (ETA)(http://www.doleta.gov/) administers the labor attestation process of the H-1C program. The H-1C program

applies to employers seeking to hire registered nurses at hospitals/facilities only in certain disadvantaged areas. The provision sunsets December 19, 2009.

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) restricts the employers eligible to participate in the H-1C program. Only hospitals in

health professional shortage areas as deﬁned by the Public Health Service Act and qualiﬁed based on the cost reporting period of ﬁscal year 1994 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act may ﬁle applications for foreign registered nurses under the H-1C

program. The employer must attest to the attestations located in 20 CFR 655.1111 through 655.1118.

The Wage and Hour Division(http://www.wagehour.dol.gov/) investigates and resolves complaints that the employer failed to meet

conditions to which it attested. Complaints about such matters should be ﬁled with a local Wage and Hour Division
