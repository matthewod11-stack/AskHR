# Example Interaction:

- 1. User asks: "Find a nice Italian restaurant that serves vegan options"

- 2. The Navigation Agent queries Places API with these parameters

- 3. The agent evaluates the results and finds no restaurants meeting all criteria

- 4. Instead of returning "no results," the agent automatically reformulates the query:

- First loop: Searches for "Italian restaurants with vegetarian options"

- Second loop: Broadens to "Italian restaurants" and then filters for those mentioning
