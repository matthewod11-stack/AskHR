# Leader Emergence

Leader emergence is the idea that people who become leaders possess traits or characteristics different from people who do not become leaders. That is, people who become leaders, such as Presidents George W. Bush and Barack H. Obama and CEOs Carly Fiorina and Michael Dell, share traits that your neighbor or a food preparer at McDonald’s does not. If we use your school as an example, we would predict that the students in your student government would be different from students who do not participate in leadership activities. In fact, research indicates that to some extent, people are “born” with a desire to lead or not lead, as somewhere between % (Ilies, Gerhardt, & Le, ) and % (Arvey, Rotundo, Johnson, Zhang, & McGue, ) of leader emergence has a genetic basis (Ilies et al., ).

Does that mean that there is a “leadership gene” that influences leader emergence? Probably not. Instead we inherit certain traits and abilities that might influence our decision to seek leadership. Though early reviews of the literature suggested that the relationship between traits and leader emergence is not very strong, as shown in Table ., more recent reviews suggest that:

People high in openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion, and low in neuroticism are more likely to emerge as leaders than their counterparts (Judge, Bono, Ilies, & Gerhardt, ). High self-monitors (people who adapt their behavior to the social situation) emerge as leaders more often than low self-monitors (Day & Schleicher, ; Day, Schleicher, Unckless, & Hiller, ). More intelligent people are more likely to emerge as leaders than are less intelligent people (Judge, Colbert, & Ilies, ). Looking at patterns of abilities and personality traits is more useful than looking at individual abilities and traits (Foti & Hauenstein, ).
