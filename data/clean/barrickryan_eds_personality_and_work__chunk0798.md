# 280 PERSONALITY AND WORK

to work all night to meet a deadline, and the many slip-ups to be some- what of a shock. However, she applied her philosophy and learned to work within the environment, maintaining organization in what she did, but not letting the poor planning of others cause her stress (it served as a source of amusing stories over dinner with her husband). Al, in contrast, feels perpetually frustrated at work and resents having to “mop up” the problems of others. He feels an urgent need to ﬁnd a new job. What leads Lauren to be able to adapt to a poor ﬁt and Al not to?

Muchinsky and Monahan (1987) noted that whether a good ﬁt today will be a good ﬁt tomorrow depends on the stability of the variables on which matches are made. We have already noted that personality is viewed as stable in adulthood; however, today’s or- ganizational environments have been characterized as more ﬂuid than ever before, with the only constant being change (Howard, 1995; Offerman & Gowing, 1990). Organizations are seeking adaptable people so that they might be responsive to organiza- tional change (LePine, Colquitt, & Erez, 2000). Thus, the ﬁnal re- search area that we address is the relationship of adaptability to personality-based PO ﬁt.

We see a wealth of research opportunities related to the em- phasis in hiring practices on seeking both adaptability and ﬁt. First, if an organization selects adaptable individuals, how important is initial ﬁt? Would adaptable individuals simply adapt to whatever organizational environment is present? Second, in organizations where most employees have good personality-based supplementary PO ﬁt, there will be little need to adapt in terms of internal orga- nizational environments because of the homogeneity. But will the organization necessarily fail to adapt to the external environment and fail (as Schneider, 2001, suggests) if all of these good-ﬁtting employees are also high in adaptability? Third, does adaptability lead one to change oneself to increase PO ﬁt, assess environments as having good ﬁt regardless of their characteristics, or develop ef- fective strategies for coping with poor ﬁt? In terms of our scenario, why is Lauren able to adapt and Al is not?

Morrison and Hall (2001) present a model of adaptability that may prove useful for this discussion. They propose that adaptabil- ity consists of adaptive competence (the ability to change) and adaptive motivation (the willingness to change). Perhaps those high in adaptive competence may not need good ﬁt to be success-
