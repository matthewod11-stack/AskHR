## Helping Job Candidates Feel Comfortable with Disclosure

Understandably, disabled job candidates feel disempowered to advocate

for their accommodation needs without fear of bias. In a study for which

we interviewed 43 college students and alumni, some reported that they

felt the need to ignore their disabilities by, in their words, “brute forcing

it” to appear nondisabled, to “play the game” and “walk the tightrope”

in order to get a foot in the door.

But what can level the playing ﬁeld so they don’t need to hide at

all, or for those who don’t have that option? Our studies show that

emphasizing their hard skills for the job (such as proﬁciencies with

speciﬁc technologies) during the interview process can help a disabled

candidate, as can delaying the conversation about accommodation

needs until after some rapport has been built.

In another study, we explored the potential eﬀect of the job candidate

using a personal assistive device (in this case, a mechanical exosuit that

assisted with lifting). Though the presence of the device increased trust

in the candidate, it did not, in the end, reduce risk or raise the odds

of employment, even when the candidate spoke about the device with

enthusiasm or provided a detailed backstory about their disability.

In our most recent study, we asked 636 managers to review the

application of a ﬁctitious candidate who similarly used the mechanical

exosuit. We created six diﬀerent versions of the candidate’s application:
