The fourth type of ad directs applicants to send a résumé to a blind box. Orga- nizations use blind boxes for three main reasons. First, the organization doesn’t want its name in public. This might be the case when a well-known company such as AT&T or IBM has a very specific job opening and is concerned that rumors will spread that there are many openings for a variety of positions. This could result in an avalanche of résumés, many from unqualified applicants. Second, the company might fear that people wouldn’t apply if they knew the name of the company. For example, an ad for sales positions would probably not draw a large response if applicants were asked to send their résumés to a funeral home (even though sell- ing burial plots can be a lucrative job). Third, on rare occasions, a company needs to terminate an employee but wants first to find a replacement. As you can imag- ine, running an ad containing the name of the company would not be smart if the current employee were not aware that he or she was about to be fired.
