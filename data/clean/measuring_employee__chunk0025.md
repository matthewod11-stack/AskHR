improve the work of my team/department(cid:514) and (cid:513)I am involved in deciding on changes introduced that affect my work area/team/department(cid:514).

This combination of dimensions reflects a broad representation of engagement that considers a range of perspectives and measures. The motivation dimension corresponds with the most commonly used measure of engagement directed towards the job (i.e. UWES – Schaufeli and Bakker, 2003): they both capture an emotional and energetic connection with work activities, such as feeling enthusiastic about work. On the other hand, the advocacy and involvement dimensions reflect core aspects of measures that capture engagement with the organisation, such as the IES (cid:507)Robinson et al, (cid:344)(cid:342)(cid:342)(cid:346)(cid:508) and Swanberg et al(cid:514)s (cid:507)(cid:344)(cid:342)(cid:343)(cid:343)(cid:508) scales. “ll of these measures aim to assess the extent to which the individual feels psychologically and behaviourally involved with the organisation, such as suggesting ideas and wanting the organisation to succeed; as well as the degree to which the individual would recommend the organisation as a place to work and as a provider of good quality services. However, by combining such different aspects of engagement into a composite (cid:513)employee engagement(cid:514) score it may be capturing a general attitude rather than a unique concept (Newman, Joseph and Hulin, 2011). This could be problematic because it may significantly overlap with other well-established attitudes such as job satisfaction or organisational commitment (Fletcher and Robinson, 2013).

Despite this, the three dimensions of the NHS employee engagement measure may be particularly important within the NHS context, given the vast array of different staff groups: clinical professions, corporate roles such as Finance and HR, technical staff groups, and support roles such as housekeeping. Staff groups may have different engagement profiles because of their differing occupation or profession. Having a finer grained view of engagement (i.e. as dimensions) allows a Trust to examine such differences. For example, West and Dawson (2012) found, when comparing different staff groups, that medical and dental staff had the highest levels of motivation, yet average levels of advocacy and involvement; whereas maintenance and ancillary staff had the highest levels of advocacy, lowest levels of involvement, and above average levels of motivation. Therefore measuring engagement as a whole construct, and as distinct dimensions, are both useful within the NHS context. Although HR practitioners may be familiar with the overall engagement measure, there may not be full awareness of the three components of the measure and how these are calculated. The benefit of examining both (cid:513)overall engagement(cid:514) and the (cid:513)components of engagement(cid:514) is highlighted by Rhian ”ishop, Staff Engagement Lead, at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust:

(cid:515)In order to better understand where action is required, we re-calculate the staff engagement score by utilising the template found in the NHS employers toolkit. This breaks down the overall staff engagement score into the three component elements.

Through this process we identified that the area for improvement, within the Trust as a whole, was staff involvement, and, subsequently, focused our efforts in this area, for example introducing staff suggestion boxes and using the Microsystems coaching academy approach. We also calculated these component scores (i.e. motivation, involvement and advocacy) for each directorate; again using the template within the NHS employers toolkit. Although staff involvement was identified as an area for improvement for the majority of directorates, it showed us that the Trust staff engagement score was masking a wide variation of scores. Knowing which directorates were weaker at staff engagement has enabled us to not only share good practice across the Trust but to also focus resources such as team development work, in directorates where the staff engagement scores were the lowest. Being able to calculate reliable directorate level staff engagement scores is dependent on having good quality data so for this reason the Trust undertook a full census NHS staff survey in 2013 and will do so again in 2014 - If we only did what we are required to, as many Trusts do, we would only survey a sample of 850 staff so with a response rate of 50% the directorate level data is insufficient to be able to calculate scores(cid:516).
