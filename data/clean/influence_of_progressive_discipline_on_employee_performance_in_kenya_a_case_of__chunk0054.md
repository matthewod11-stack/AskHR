conditioning people to repeat behavior by positive reinforcement in the form of feedback and knowledge of results. Through employee reprimand system, employees receive feedback on their performance. Reinforcement theory explains that people behave in ways they expect will produce positive outcomes. The degree to which experience shapes future behavior depends on extent to which individuals correctly perceive the connection between behavior and its outcome and on the extent to which they are able to recognize resemblance between the previous situation and one that now confronts them.

It has been suggested that behavioral theories based on the principle of reinforcement or the law of effect are limited because they imply, in All port(cid:859)s (cid:894)(cid:1005)(cid:1013)(cid:1009)(cid:1008)(cid:895) phrase, (cid:862)hedo(cid:374)is(cid:373) of the past(cid:863). They assume that the present choices of an individual are found in an examination of the consequences of their past choices and this influence the expectations. The above theory facilitated the understanding of the study variable and objective that is to establish the effects of employee reprimand system on employee performance in Kenya.
