# De ne clear actions

Make sure every step in your routine corresponds to a speci√Éc action or output. For example, a step might instruct the agent to ask the user for their order number or to call an API to retrieve account details. Being explicit about the action (and even the wording of a user-facing message) leaves less room(cid:144) for errors in interpretation.
