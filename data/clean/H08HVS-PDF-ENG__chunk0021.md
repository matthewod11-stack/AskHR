Leaders and teams that make the right things easier and the wrong

things harder in organizations treat friction ﬁxing as a way of life. As one CEO told us about his company’s eﬀorts to eliminate unnecessary

meetings, such work is like “mowing the lawn”: Constant maintenance

is required; there is no “one and done.”

That’s why, despite Steve Gordon’s pride that the DMV had improved

customer service in so many ways in just ﬁve years, he emphasized, “We

still have a lot more to do; we are certainly not celebrating in the end

zone yet.” Above all, we are impressed by Gordon’s devotion to creating

a culture at the DMV where, long after he and his team have moved

on, people will question the status quo, move swiftly to prevent and

repair the never-ending problems that arise in every organization, and

“think of [themselves] as a competitive customer product and behave as

if dissatisﬁed customers could take their business elsewhere.”
