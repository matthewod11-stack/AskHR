Comparing the size of the indirect effects suggests that compared to LMX, trust in the

leader explained significantly more variance in the relationship between many leadership

styles and job performance. Specifically, significantly larger indirect effects were found for

transformational, servant, and ethical leadership and performance via trust compared to

LMX. This is indicated by non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Except for

paternalistic leadership, we also found trust to be the strongest mediator for all leadership

styles when OCB was the outcome of interest. Significantly larger indirect effects were found

for transformational, servant, authentic, empowering, abusive, and ethical leadership and

OCB via trust compared to LMX. The findings show LMX and trust in the leader are

distinctive explanatory pathways which can each explain unique variance supporting
