## Authors: Judite Adriano1 Chris W. Callaghan1

Background: Undertaking degree studies while working can provide life-changing career opportunities. These studies, however, can introduce substantial work-life balance conflict, particularly for those with family responsibilities, with important implications for retention.

Affiliation: 1Division of Human Resource Management and Management, School of Business Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa

Aim: The aim of this study is to test theory that predicts the effects of certain moderating and mediated influences on the relationship between work-life balance conflict and turnover intentions of professional staff undertaking evening degree classes at a selected South African university.

Setting: The sample was drawn from a large university in Gauteng, South Africa.
