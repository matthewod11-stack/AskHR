# HBR / Digital Article / How Middle-Market Companies Can Find the Best Leadership T…

Consider this case: A veteran CEO with previous PE experience was

selected by a middle-market ﬁrm to lead a rapidly scaling industrials

company. He came highly recommended by a prominent search ﬁrm

and was hired for his experience and dynamic working style. And

in some ways, he delivered: He moved fast, brought energy, and

executed at a pace consistent with PE expectations. But cracks quickly

surfaced. He remained woefully disconnected from operational details;

delegated with vague, high-level direction; and failed to follow up on

critical initiatives. In the wake of rapid M&A, he struggled to bring

the operational discipline the business needed to integrate and scale eﬀectively.

If agility is often misunderstood, conﬁdence is even more so. Many

executives see conﬁdence as an unqualiﬁed positive: a trait that signals

decisiveness, presence, and control. But conﬁdence, like agility, comes

with a shadow side. Left unchecked, it can morph into arrogance,

resistance to feedback, or a lack of collaboration. And in a PE-backed

environment, where alignment with ownership is as important as

execution, that can cause serious problems.

Conﬁdence is often what gets executives promoted, but when it isn’t

tempered by humility or self-awareness, it becomes a red ﬂag. We

worked with one ﬁrm that hired a regional sales VP from a Fortune

500 company to become its ﬁrst chief revenue oﬃcer for a $1.4 billion

food company. While he had been charismatic, sharp, and superb in his

previous role, in his new one he became the kind of boss who resisted

collaboration and didn’t listen to feedback, even from the CFO. In PE-

backed environments, that kind of conﬁdence without humility is a risk
