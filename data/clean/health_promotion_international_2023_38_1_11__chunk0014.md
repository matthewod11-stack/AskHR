# (Un)belonging at work

Mitchell hastily enters the control room with his leather bag in hand. ‘Oh my, there he is, the pro- fessor’, another operator remarks to us. Mitchell introduces himself and tells us that his colleagues call him that because his head never stops thinking and he always engages in discussions. Before and after every shift, he bikes half an hour to work to be physically active and, most importantly, to clear his head and to digest everything that happened at work. Mitchell tells that Hank and he always work as a desk–field operator pair. They have arranged a clear task division, which aligns with their person- alities and capabilities. Being the busy and vivacious one, Mitchell works best as a field operator in the factory, while Hank, the calm and organized one, is an excellent desk operator. Mitchell gets tired and cold behind the desk and finds the work too stress- ful. Checking the computer, telephone, helping the truck drivers—sometimes he just cannot handle all of that. Hank can, and he keeps Mitchell on track via the transceiver. (Field notes)

The vignette shows how two colleagues, with spe- cific characteristics and preferences, adjust their work tasks between them, enabling durable work rhythms. Across the five shift-teams, we observed how these kinds of relations and rhythms were arranged over the years. The vignette exemplifies how belonging to a team that cares for each other and allows flexibility and autonomy to divide and adjust tasks in line with employees’ skills, qualities and characteristics, may foster workplace health. If Mitchell would have been obliged to work as a desk operator, his (mental) health would likely have been impaired.

At the time of fieldwork, the company started a pilot introducing a schedule where the operators could plan their own work shifts according to their preferences. This differed from the fixed schedule in which the five shifts followed the same structure every year. In case of holidays or other events, the operators could switch within or outside their own group. The flexible sched- ule would disrupt the structure of five shifts, meaning that the operators would no longer work in the fixed teams that existed almost 10 years. HR introduced the pilot as a vitality measure as it would allow operators to minimize working at night when having troubles with that. Although some operators acknowledged that the flexible schedule would allow more flexibility in planning their private lives, many operators strongly resisted the pilot, partly because the understanding of ‘health’ behind flexible scheduling did not align with their own understanding:

What is healthy for me? Is that the morning, after- noon, or night shift? I am exhausted after a morning

shift; is that healthy? I don’t mind the nights, so in the flexible schedule, I will probably work more night shifts than morning shifts; is that healthy? (field notes)

Another concern was that in the flexible schedule, the operators would work in different teams each shift instead of in fixed teams, impeding team building and, as an operator put it, ‘undermining the bit of team spirit that we have’ (field notes). Following up on his story about working with Hank, Mitchell commented on the flexible schedule:

I think it is a pity when the flexible schedule pilot tears apart the fixed teams because Hank and I have been attuned to each other for almost ten years! But I also understand that it is good if you are able to work with everyone. (field notes)

Mitchell’s concern about the team spirit among the operators resonated with a shift leader’s view on how to manage 50 operators instead of ten in the fixed schedule:

Now, I know the home situation of my team so that I can adjust to that and take it into account in the daily work. How should I know that in the flexible schedule? We are with 50 operators in total; I sim- ply cannot know how all of them feel. (field notes)

In contrast to WHP’s conception of individual health management, the preceding quote shows that work- place health is also about a shift leader checking in with his team members and knowing how they feel. An employee described the situation in the company as follows: ‘We have a shared goal, and that’s pro- duction and earning money for our shareholders. But we can only do that when we are happy’ (field notes). Managing health at work is thus not just an individual matter; it is a social practice—comprising how team members work together, care for one another and man- agers that know how their team members feel. These are dynamics at work that shape the physical/psycho- logical dimension of belonging in that the feeling to belong to a team and/or organization, of the lack there- fore, may foster or impair employees’ happiness, health and well-being.

Signalling each other’s conditions and balancing energy levels at the social workplace In the mailing and packaging division of the social workplace, most employees initially told us that they knew what they ‘should’ do in general for their indi- vidual health. As time went by, the employees discussed
