# 4.2.2(cid:32) Focus on Performance

This responses to this measure are contained in question A3 and A10. As illustrated

in figure 4.2.2, the survey found out that line managers recognized the importance

of coaching on improving performance. Performance reviews are done on a

quarterly basis. 100% of the respondents acknowledged that the appraisals are done

quarterly. Coaching is focused primarily on underperforming employees to improve

their performance, increase their capability and helping them to feel motivated to

develop and progress. On the question of whether coaching is used as an integrated

part of a training and development program to improve employee performance and

skills, the responses were split. Some respondents felt that it should and others it

should not. This is shown in the figure below.
