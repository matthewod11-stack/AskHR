# Employer Actions at the Employee Level

Once a company has collected some data and knows the range of engagement levels among its workforce, the next step is to take actions to raise engagement among individual employees. One useful action is to change how managers give work performance feedback to each of the employees that they supervise. Another employer action is to offer and actively promote the use of mental health services to help employees respond to personal and work challenges and in so doing reduce the degree to which personal obstacles interfere with work engagement.

Positive Supervisory Communication. One simple and low-cost management practice at the individual level is to change the way employees are given feedback about their job performance. A study from the U.K. found that employees who had a personal development plan for their work and who received formal performance appraisals for their job had significantly higher engagement levels than those who did not.20 A Gallup study found dramatic differences between engaged employees and less-engaged employees in how their supervisors communicated with them. In this study, 77 percent of highly engaged employees

agreed with the statement: “My supervisor focuses on my strengths or positive characteristics,” compared to only 23 percent of moderately engaged employees and just four percent of disengaged employees.25 In another study of communication between supervisors and their staff, the Corporate Leadership Council analyzed survey responses from over 19,000 employees and managers.26 The results of this study found that supervisory emphasis on the strengths of employee task performance enhanced the future work performance of their employees by 36 percent, whereas an emphasis on the weaknesses of task performance reduced future work performance by 27 percent.

Taken together, the results from these studies indicate that focusing on the strengths of employees tends to improve employee perform- ance, whereas focusing on employee weaknesses tends to undermine performance. These studies also support the growing interest among business leaders in the “positive psychology” approach to management that relies on building up the positive qualities of employee work behaviors instead of focusing on the problems. Examples of companies using a positive psychology approach and creating a “strengths-based” organizational culture include BAE Systems, Best Buy, Norwich Union, Toyota, Wells Fargo, and Yahoo!.27 In a larger sense, the emphasis on better communication skills among managers is related to the series of findings by researcher Daniel Goleman on how emotional intelligence among managers is critical to better communication.28

Offering EAP and Mental Health Benefits. The literature also indicates that mental health issues and distressing work experiences can play a role in limiting employee work performance and engagement.29 For example, some employees may work too much and too long because they have difficulty in setting limits on their work behavior, some may have irrational thinking patterns that make managing stress and workplace changes even more difficult, and others may suffer from social anxieties that make coworker and supervisory communication difficult. In other examples, anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse and other more serious kinds of mental health disorders can affect the ability of employees to be productive and engaged in their work.29 These kinds of work and psychological problems can be identified and treated

successfully through employer-sponsored services, like seeing a counselor from the employee assistance program (EAP) or having a behavioral health consultation with a psychiatrist.30
