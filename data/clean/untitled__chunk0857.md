## Conclusion: Relations among the Various Models of the Nature of Intelligence

interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalist, and possibly existen- tial and spiritual. R. J. Sternberg (1985, 1988, 1997, 1999b) has proposed a theory of successful intelligence, according to which intelligence can be seen in terms of various kinds of information-processing components combining in differ- ent ways to generate analytical, creative, and practical abil- ities. Ceci (1996) has proposed a bioecological model of intelligence, according to which intelligence is understood in the interaction between the biology of the individual and the ecology in which the individual lives. These theories are described in more detail in “Contemporary Theories of In- telligence” (see Volume 7 of this handbook).
