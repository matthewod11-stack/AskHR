relationship between workplace coaching and turnover intentions (see Ali et al., 2018). The other negative outcome we explore is counterproductive work behaviours (CWBs), which are defined as ‘intentional employee behavior that is harmful to the legitimate interests of an organization’ (Dalal, 2005, pp. 1241–1242). A meta-analysis by Dalal (2005) found only a modest negative relationship between OCBs and CWBs, confirming that CWBs are distinct rather than simply the opposite of OCBs. Moreover, and sig- nificantly, CWBs may harm workplace outcomes and employee wellbeing (Robinson & Bennett, 1995). Raza and Ahmed (2020) previously reported a negative relationship between workplace coaching and employee deviance. Under SET and LMX, employees who have not received formal coaching should report higher levels of negative outcomes because they feel deprived, leading to greater turnover intentions and deviant workplace behaviours. Conversely, employees who have received formal coaching should report lower negative work-related attitudes and behaviours because they recognise the value they have been given. This leads to our second hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2: Employees receiving formal coaching will report significantly lower levels of (a) turnover intentions, and (b) CWBs compared with those who are not formally coached.
