# Conclusion

In conclusion, we argued above that various aspects of omnibus and discrete contextual variables can have potentially important implications for the outcomes of diversity in organizations. We propose that the mixed ﬁndings from diversity research can be better explicated through a careful analysis of the context in which these studies were undertaken. In the subsequent sections, we present the ﬁndings of a literature review that we undertook to answer three main questions:

- 1. Are there speciﬁc trends in diversity research that help us articulate the importance of considering diversity context?

- 2. Which aspects of the context have received attention in diversity research either as moderator or as control variables?

- 3. What are the various research contexts in which diversity research has been undertaken and can these research contexts account for the varied ﬁndings reported in studies?
