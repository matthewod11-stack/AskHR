## According to a research paper, “The Value of Stress Free Productivity”

by Crucial Learning, high performers are the heroes of a team, often

generating more than 60% of the output. Research shows these

superstars can deliver 400% more productivity than their peers, and

just being near high performers has the potential to boost other

workers’’ output by 15%.

This means your high performers are critical to your team’s success —

and you should make an eﬀort to retain them. A part of that involves

delivering valuable feedback to help them learn and grow, as data shows

this group is highly motivated by feedback. They’re also likely to move

one and look for other opportunities when they don’t receive quality

coaching in their current roles.

Despite this, high performers consistently receive lower-quality

feedback than their colleagues, with it being worst for high-performing

women. Managers often spend the majority of their eﬀorts trying to

improve the output of lower performers. The problem occurs when

those eﬀorts lead a manager to be too hands-oﬀ with their other team

members. Given the important contributions high performers make,

you should aim to balance your feedback eﬀorts and make sure you’re

not overlooking top employees’ needs.

Here are ﬁve actions you can take to make sure your feedback approach

is fair and keeps top talent engaged — along with examples of how to

give them feedback.
