The tensions between older and younger workers are not new. Now,

some human capital futurists believe that we are on our way to a post-

generational workforce environment — a paradigm that suggests the

path forward might be to transcend generational diﬀerences instead of

overly focusing on them. Deloitte’s 2020 Global Human Capital Trends

survey suggests that the post-pandemic workforce may be characterized

by greater cross-generational alignment regarding what people want out

of work (such as meaning, purpose, and growth). This means leaders

have the opportunity to capitalize on that intergenerational alignment

by designing organizational life around the importance of purpose.

Centering personal and organizational purpose represents a critical

opportunity for leaders on the quest to build sustainable 6G

organizations. It’s not just members of the younger generations who

are motivated by purpose, preferring to work for organizations that

make a positive diﬀerence. McKinsey reports employees at all levels

want purpose in their lives. Embracing this commonality elevates

the conversation around the company’s purpose, why it matters, how

it is experienced by colleagues, customers, and clients. To do this,

leaders must move beyond the marketing spin and commit to helping

colleagues see how working in their organization can help them activate
