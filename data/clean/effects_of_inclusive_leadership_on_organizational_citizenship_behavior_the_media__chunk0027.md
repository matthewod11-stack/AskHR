the organization, seems more appropriate in estimating the influ- ence of the organizational learning culture on the individual’s behavior toward the organization (i.e. OCB). We found that this approach of organizational learning culture is often used and is consistent with past research (Islam et al., 2012; Joo, 2010; Joo & Shim, 2010; Marsick & Watkins, 2003; Naqshbandi & Tabche, 2018).

Assessment of common method variance In accordance with Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff’s (2003) suggestion that assuring respondents of confidentiality can help reduce respondents’ evaluation apprehension and make them less likely to edit their responses to be socially desirable, we minimized common method bias by assuring respondents of our commitment to confidentiality. We stated this on the cover let- ter attached to each questionnaire. The common method variance (CMV)wasassessed usingHarman’s single-factortest forallitems. The results suggest that no general factor emerged to account for the majority of the variance. An unrotated factor analysis extracted four distinct factors that accounted for 70.4% of the total variance. The largest factor explained 38.2% of the variance. Thus, CMV did not appear to be a problem in this analysis. In addition, the variance inflation factors (VIF) were calculated to check multicol- linearity. VIF values ranged from 1.08 to 1.50, suggesting that there was no serious problem concerning multicollinearity issues (Neter, Wasserman, & Kutner, 1989).

In addition, we also implemented the marker variable test to evaluatetheCMVissuefurtherinouranalysisbyfollowingtherec- ommendations of Lindell and Whitney (2001) and Williams, Hartman, and Cavazotte (2010). These studies reported that many researchers have used the correlational marker technique even though they use latent variable methods to test their substantive hypotheses (Lindell & Whitney, 2001; Williams et al., 2010). Our study examines the effects of inclusive leadership (IL), organi- zational justice (OJ), and organizational learning culture (OLC) on OCB in a cross-sectional study. Thus, first, we suppose that a fourth predictor, educational level, was identified a priori as being theoretically unrelated to our dependent variable (i.e. OCB). Accordingly, it was placed in the correlation analysis between the dependent variable and the other predictors to serve as the MV-marker variable. Thus, we have conducted the hypothetical correlation test among three predictors (IL, OJ, OLC), the marker variable (MV), and the dependent variable (OCB). The data support our model by confirming that three theoretically relevant predictorshave statistically significant correlationswiththedepen- dent variable, whereas the theoretically irrelevant predictor (marker variable: educational level) has a non-significant correla- tion with the dependent variable. Moreover, the correlations of the MV-marker variable with the other predictor variables are low. These low correlations with the other predictor variables further support the discriminant validity of the MV-marker variable.

The result shows that the correlations for the three predictors (IL, OJ, OLC) with the dependent variable (OCB) are significant even before the CMV adjustment is applied. We controlled for CMV by using rOCB4 = .106 as the estimate of rs (see more infor- mation onapplication ofequations4and5inLindell andWhitney, 2001, p. 116); the results indicate that the correlations of all three predictors (IL, OJ, OLC) with the dependent variable (OCB) remain statistically significant even when CMV is controlled (IL = .443, p < .01; OJ = .330, p < .01; OLC = .187, p < .01). Moreover, these correlations have practical significance because
