# Building Organizational Resilience

Many company leaders I talk to fear that if they oﬀer a sabbatical, they’ll

essentially give a “golden parachute” to an employee who intends

to leave. Here’s some good news: According to my research, 80% of

extended-break-takers return to their companies. Of course, that means

that 20% do not. While this number is far preferable to the 0% of

employees who return when they are forced to quit to get an extended

leave, it does suggest that turnover is a legitimate worry. Recruiting and

training a new hire takes time, and the process is disruptive, creating

extra work for those who remain.
