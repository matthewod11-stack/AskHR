# and path-dependence.

A way to investigate the stability of labor-market preferences is to measure how

much expressed preferences can be influenced by the way that work is described, or

the procedure by which preferences are elicited (e.g., bidding wages or choosing at

a fixed wage). For example, Ariely et al. (2004a) asked some subjects whether they

would pay $2 to attend a fifteen-minute poetry reading, and asked other subjects whether they would attend if they were paid $2.7 Later, a third of those who were

anchored on paying said they would attend for free, compared to only 8% attendance

by those who were anchored on being paid. Of course, students may not have developed clear preferences for whether listening to poetry is labor or leisure.* But

if a random anchor can even influence the sign of c(e), then it is likely that stronger

3Later experiments link the anchor to digits in a person’s social security number and make it clear that the anchor was random, so that no information about c(e) is conveyed by the choice of the anchor.

4The ambiguity about c(e) is illustrated by a joke about a couple who are going away on a vacation. They ask their teenage neighbor, Mike, if he could take care of their dog while they are away. The couple

explain that their dog needs to be fed, walked, and shown lots of loving care. They ask how much this job is worth to Mike. He ponders for a minute and concludes, “Well, I guess I'd pay you $10.” What’s

labor for one worker may be leisure for another.
