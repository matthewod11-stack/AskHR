## Center at the University of New Hampshire and an expert in bystander

interventions, told me about an all-too-familiar scenario: Say there’s a lecherous guy in the oﬃce — someone who makes oﬀ-color jokes,

watches porn at his cubicle, or hits on younger workers. Everyone

knows who he is. But no one says anything. Co-workers may laugh

uncomfortably at his jokes, or ignore them. Maybe they’ll warn a new

employee to stay away from him. Maybe not. “Everybody’s watching,

and nobody’s doing anything about it. So the message the perpetrator

gets is, ‘My behavior is normal and natural,’” Stapleton said. “No one’s

telling him, ‘I don’t think you should do that.’ Instead, they’re telling

the new intern, ‘Don’t go into the copy room with him.’ It’s all about

risk aversion — which we know through decades of research on rape

prevention, does not stop perpetrators from perpetrating.”

When bystanders remain silent, and targets are the ones expected

to shoulder responsibility for avoiding, fending oﬀ, or shrugging oﬀ

oﬀensive behavior, it normalizes sexual harassment and toxic or hostile
