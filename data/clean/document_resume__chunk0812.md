# Performance Appraisal

resist performance appraisal altogether. The answer is that sonic people ale difficult, but they are probably that way long before performance appraisal was instituted. The performance appraisal process itself provides a means to address certain aspects of these problems. Moreover, most administrators will agree that dealing with difficult people is a fact of organizational life and conies with the job. It is also useful to ask superiors to review their on assumptions about people to avoid McGregor's self-ful- filling prophecy.

Finally, it will probably be necessary to address the concerns of professional asso- ciations and possibly unions. These organizations may view with suspicion an admin- istrative activity which might be used to threaten job security or undermine well estab- lished seniority systems. While it may not be possible to gain their wholehearted endorsement of performance appraisal, is best not to adopt a confrontational it approach. At a minimum, be willing to "meet and confer" and establish as much common ground as possible. Keep in mind these organizations also have a stake in the accountability issue and face the same pressures felt by institutional administrators.

For everyone concerned, the best approach is to promote a positive climate of mutual trust. Most superiors want to be fair, and most subordinates will accept honest ratings. The key is a well respected concept of common law known as "good faith and fair dealing."
