# creative solutions.

When an organization oﬀers extended breaks as a routine part of

its culture, it builds the capacity to handle turnover. It’s a form of

resilience training, as the company is forced to ﬁll the gaps the absent

person leaves behind — even if it’s just for a little while — and the

colleagues who ﬁll them get stretch experiences and opportunities to

prove themselves. Ironically, enacting a sabbatical policy can help a

company both prevent and prepare for the departure of key people.
