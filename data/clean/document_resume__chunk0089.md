# Legal Considerations

Performance ratings, when used to justify dc,.isions related a., such areas as promo- tion, merit pay, and terminations, are subject to federal and state laws and regulations which prohibit discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, and handicapping condition. The centerpiece' of EEO Legislation is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Beginning with the landmark case, Griggs v. Duke Power Company, both the courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have mandated that appraisals be based on criteria which ale valid or job related. While it is not impossible to prose job relatedness to the satisfaction of a com- pliance agency or court, certain essential steps must be followed. What is required, "... at a minimum, is a degree of logical argument and factual es idence, not just a subjec- tive appeal to intuition and so-called common sense."' I

An institution which loses a Title VII case is subject to back pay awards which can be substantial in a class action suit. In addition, courts usual') allow the prevailing party to recover attorney fees. There 'lase been Lases where courts have found defen- dants to be personally liable for violating the rights of mills iduals. Finally; a court is likely to impose hiring and promotional quotas, as well as requiring the employer to revise its selection practices. Es en if the employer wins, a lawsuit is sery costly. Time and resources insested in research and anal)sisanswering interrogatones, and prepara- tion for trial, unlike attorney fees, cannot be recovered.
