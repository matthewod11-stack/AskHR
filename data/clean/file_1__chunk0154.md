Data: Quantitative questionnaire data from Gender Equality Barometer 2008. N = 1583 individuals.

This paper aims at examining individuals’ perceptions of overall gender inequality. By scrutinizing theories from social psychology, such as the gender socialization perspective (Stockard, 1999), occupational socialization theory (Smith and Rogers, 2000), relative deprivation theory (Crosby, 1982), the study identifies a comprehensive list of determinants of individuals’ perceptions of overall gender inequality. The model is tested applying the data from the Finnish Gender Equality Barometer 2008, which investigates the experiences and attitudes of individuals in matters concerning gender inequality. The empirical analysis reveals that individuals’ gender, age, and occupational categorization are significant determinants of their perceptions of overall gender inequality. In addition, the results show that both employed and retired people perceive overall gender inequality to a greater extent to exist than students.
