# DEFINE YOUR SUCCESS CRITERIA

Good success criteria are:

- 1. Specific. Rather than pursuing broad objectives like

‘improved performance,’ leading organizations define specific, actionable targets. For instance, they might target ‘95% accuracy in customer inquiry classification’ or ‘reduction in average resolution time from 45 to 30 minutes.’

- 2. Measurable. Use quantitative metrics or well-defined qualitative scales. Consider ways to measure abstract concepts – transforming goals like ‘ethical AI deployment’ into concrete metrics such as ‘less than 0.1% of outputs flagged for bias across 10,000 interactions.’

- 3. Aligned with business objectives. The strongest

programs tie AI performance to core business objectives, whether that’s operational efficiency, revenue growth, or customer satisfaction.

- 4. Time bound. Create measurement frameworks that track progress across multiple time horizons, from quick wins to long-term transformation goals.
