# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 239

vironment may be similar in evoking individuals’ achievement mo- tivation but different in evoking extraversion. This suggests that learners may seek out the psychological ﬁdelity in a learning situ- ation to help them determine how to react or behave. The learner can then draw from experience in similar situations that evoke the same feelings of psychological ﬁdelity. This notion is yet another reason for further research on taxonomies of situational charac- teristics and their psychological underpinnings (see Hattrup & Jackson, 1996).

Taking a dynamic, active learning perspective on individuals and situations captures the reality of the learning context better. An active learning perspective requires considering how people with a certain level of personality characteristic respond to particular learn- ing situations, as well as adapt to changing learning situations. Fig- ure 9.1 provides three graphs for the frequency of a particular type of behavior exhibited by learners for three different learning situ- ations, given differences in a personality characteristic p across learners. Let us say that the behavior is feedback-seeking behavior, the personality characteristic is conscientiousness, and the three situations are such that S1 represents one-one-one training, S2 rep- resents group training, and S3 represents computer-based train- ing. The ﬁgure illustrates that learners with a particular level of conscientiousness show differences in the frequency of feedback seeking depending on the learning situation. The vertical arrow
