# Work Samples

With a work sample, the applicant performs actual job-related tasks. For exam- ple, an applicant for a job as automotive mechanic might be asked to fix a torn fan belt; a secretarial applicant might be asked to type a letter; and a truck-driver applicant might be asked to back a truck up to a loading dock.

Work samples are excellent selection tools for several reasons. First, because they are directly related to job tasks, they have excellent content validity. Second, scores from work samples tend to predict actual work performance and thus have excellent criterion validity (Callinan & Robertson, ). Third, because job applicants are able to see the connection between the job sample and the work performed on the job, the samples have excellent face validity and thus are challenged less often in civil service appeals or in court cases (Whelchel, ). Finally, work samples have lower racial differences in test scores than do written cognitive ability tests (Roth, Huffcutt, & Bobko, ; Roth, Bobko, McFarland, ), although the actual extent of the difference is still under debate (Bobko, Roth, & Buster, ). The main reason for not using work samples is that they can be expensive to both construct and administer. For this reason, work samples are best used for well-paying jobs for which many employees will be hired.
