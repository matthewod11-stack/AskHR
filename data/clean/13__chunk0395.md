Certainly, cross-sectional analysis has its limitations when considering job performance over time. The disadvantage of this approach is that conclusions must be based on two critical assumptions. First, one must assume that the mean level of the characteristic does not vary with time. For the example above, cognitive ability should not be lower for individuals with less experience than for those with more experience. Unfortunately, in the study of job performance, it is likely that this assumption will be violated. One reason this may occur is because of the demonstrated relationship between job performance and turnover (Trevor, Gerhart, & Boudreau, 1997; Salamin & Hom, 2005; Williams & Livingstone, 1994). If the characteristics under investigation are associated with performance, and if performance is related to turnover, then the distribution of the characteristic will likely change over time. Because of the negative relationship between performance and turnover (Williams & Livingstone, 1994), those with low levels of the characteristic would be expected to leave the company over time, and a cross-sectional representation would have a wider range of the characteristic for newer employees and a restricted distribution of the characteristics for those with more tenure. If high performers are also
