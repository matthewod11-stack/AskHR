## HBR / Digital Article / What DeepSeek Can Teach Us About Resourcefulness

- 1. Harness online knowledge to build your capability.

It has never been easier to do your own research, ﬁnd answers, or

develop new capabilities. At no cost you can learn sales techniques from

a podcast,3D printing for mass manufacturing on YouTube, coding from

Khan Academy, or skills such as design, sourcing, ﬁnance, packaging,

or taxation. There’s a whole world of free knowledge and education

out there for anyone to take advantage of—though most people and

organizations don’t. With OpenAI, online knowledge is further enriched

and ready to be tapped at little-to-no cost.

Consider the company Not Impossible Labs. It set out to create a

brand-new opportunity for the deaf to experience live music just as the

nondeaf do. It called the project Music: Not Impossible.
