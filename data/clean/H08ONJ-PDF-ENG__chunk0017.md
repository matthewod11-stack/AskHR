## Neither Mick Ebeling, the head of Not Impossible Labs, nor Daniel

Belquer, who led the project, had the requisite expertise to make

this happen. Neither is a scientist, a brain specialist, or a doctor

of audiology, but they scoured the internet for scientiﬁc studies on

vibration and the auditory functioning of the ear. They learned that

it’s not the ears, it’s the brain that “hears” as vibrations are captured

through the ear. This revelation, among others, led them to the

realization that while vibrations can’t be captured by the ears of the

deaf, they could be relayed to the brain via the skin to simulate

the experience of music. With this knowledge they created wearable

technology to realize Music: Not Impossible.

Through resourcefulness, Ebeling and Belquer were able to leverage—

essentially at no cost—the best knowledge out there to make Music: Not

Impossible possible and overcome obstacles as they built it.

Ask yourself: What knowledge do you need to realize your business

model and opportunity? Make a list and start searching the internet or

leveraging AI. Begin with broad parameters to cast your knowledge net
