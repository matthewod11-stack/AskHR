# Critical Incident Examples

1.

About a year ago, I was driving home from school and had a fl at tire. I was having trouble changing the tire when the police offi cer stopped and helped me. He then followed me to the nearest gas station to make sure that I didn’t have any more trouble. Most cops probably wouldn’t have done a darn thing to help.

2.

I got pulled over for doing 45 in a 25 mph zone. Instead of just writing me up, the cop told me what a jerk I was for speeding and that if he ever saw me speed again, I would get more than a ticket. He was the one who was the jerk!

performance (Flanagan, ). Th is technique can be conducted in many ways, but the basic procedure is as follows.

. Job incumbents each generate between one and ﬁ ve incidents of both excellent and poor performance that they have seen on the job. Th ese incidents can be obtained in many ways—log books, questionnaires, interviews, and so on; research has shown that the method used makes little diﬀ erence (Campion, Greener, & Wernli, ), although questionnaires are usually used because they are the easiest. A convenient way to word requests for critical incidents is by asking incumbents to think of times they saw workers perform in an especially outstanding way and then to write down exactly what occurred. Incumbents are then asked to do the same for times they saw workers perform poorly. Th is process is repeated as needed. Two examples of critical incidents are shown in Table ..

. Job experts examine each incident and decide whether it is an example of excellent or poor behavior. Th is step is necessary because approximately % of incidents initially cited as poor examples by employees are actually good examples and vice versa (Aamodt, Reardon, & Kimbrough, ). For example, in a recent job analysis of the position of university instructor, a few students described their worst teachers as those who lectured from material not included in their textbooks. A committee of faculty members and students who reviewed the incidents determined that lecturing from nontext material actually was excellent. Th us, the incidents were counted as examples of excellent rather than poor performance.

. Th e incidents generated in the ﬁ rst stage are then given to three or four incumbents to sort into an unspeciﬁ ed number of categories. Th e incidents in each category are then read by the job analyst, who combines, names, and deﬁ nes the categories.

. To verify the judgments made by the job analyst in procedure , three other incumbents are given the incidents and category names and are asked to sort the incidents into the newly created categories. If two of the three incumbents sort an incident into the same category, the incident is considered part of that category. Any incident that is not agreed upon by two sorters is either thrown out or placed in a new category.

. Th e numbers of both types of incidents sorted into each category

are then tallied and used to create a table similar to Table .. Th e categories provide the important dimensions of a job, and the numbers provide the relative importance of these dimensions.

Th e CIT is an excellent addition to a job analysis because the actual critical incidents can be used for future activities such as performance appraisal and train- ing. Th e CIT’s greatest drawback is that its emphasis on the diﬀ erence between
