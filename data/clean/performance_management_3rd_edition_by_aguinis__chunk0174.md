# 1.4.7 Allowances

Benefits in some countries and organizations include allowances covering housing and transportation. These kinds of allowances are typical for expatriate personnel and are popular for high-level managers throughout the world. In South Africa, for example, it is common for a transportation allowance to include one of the following choices:31

- The employer provides a car and the employee has the right to use it both privately and for business.

- The employer provides a car allowance, more correctly referred to as a travel allowance, which means reimbursing the employee for the business use of the employeeâ€™s personal car.

Other allowances can include smart phones and their monthly charges, club and gym fees, discount loans, and mortgage subsidies.32 Although these allowances are clearly a benefit for employees, some of them directly or indirectly also produce a benefit for the employer. For example, smart phones means that employees are reachable via phone, text, and e-mail 24/7. Similarly, if employees take advantage of a gym fee allowance, they are likely to stay healthier which in turn may lead to less health-related expenses for the organization.
