## HBR / Digital Article / How 6 Companies Approached Digital Transformation

Toby E. Stuart, of UC Berkley’s Haas School of Business. “The tech was

evolving incredibly quickly and there were no proven use cases for how

it could be applied to create value. [Moody’s CEO Rob] Fauber likened

the initiative to sprinting into the fog—it might be possible to see a few

steps ahead, but no further.”

In spite of not having a precise endpoint, leadership had an idea of what

they wanted to achieve: a sweeping cultural shift that would enable the

company to take advantage of this new technology, however it evolved.

So, they decided on three guidelines. First, they wanted every employee,

at every level, to be involved—a goal that required buy-in from 14,000

employees. Second, they wanted to resist the instinct to reject new

ideas, and encourage legal, compliance, and risk staﬀ in particular to

take a “yes, and…” approach. And third, the aim throughout this eﬀort

needed to be contributing measurable value to the business.
