# HBR / Digital Article / Research: Whistleblowing Is More Common When CEOs Are Ov…

We measured ﬁrms’ treatment of diﬀerent stakeholders using

standardized strength scores, calculated as the total strength score

divided by the total number of dimensions in corresponding areas.

For instance, in 2010-2011, Amazon was recognized for its exceptional

customer service (earning 1 out of 3 KLD strength dimensions for

customer treatment). At the same time, it faced severe criticism for

poor warehouse working conditions (earning 0 out of 5 KLD strength

dimensions for employee treatment). This represents a signiﬁcant

disparity in ﬁrm’s treatment of customers and employees.

We used both archival data and experimental data to look at how

pay disparity and external stakeholder disparity aﬀect the likelihood

of employees blowing the whistle and reporting organizational

wrongdoing to external authorities (in our case, regarding unsafe/

unhealthy working conditions).

We found that in ﬁrms with greater disparities, employees were

more likely to become whistleblowers—and this likelihood was further

enhanced when employees believed they could easily ﬁnd another job.

We also conducted two experiments to further understand the

psychology behind this decision. In the ﬁrst experiment, which involved

247 full-time employees in the U.S., we manipulated CEO-employee pay

disparities (to be high or low) and found CEO-employee pay disparities

led to higher “willingness to report a health-related issue—inadequate
