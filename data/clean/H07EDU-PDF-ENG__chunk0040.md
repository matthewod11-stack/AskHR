Dave Cote, who engineered the turnaround of Honeywell in the

2000s used furloughs rather than layoﬀs to reduce costs during the

Great Recession. Cote’s intact workforce enabled him to continue

product development, earning Honeywell a three-year total stock return

between 2009 and 2012 of 75% — more than 20 points higher than GE,

his nearest competitor. Cote didn’t hesitate to use mass layoﬀs when

exiting underperforming businesses. He also made strategic hires in

areas he was growing, and consistently used performance management

to ensure that the people who worked in the company were ones they

wanted to keep.
