# discussion.

Don’t proceed without a human facilitator. You need someone to

orchestrate the team-AI collaboration, creating the loops between AI

and the team discussion—particularly when the team is large. Not

all managers are good facilitators. The good news is that AI can

support this too: it can suggest facilitation approaches and techniques,

act as a co-facilitator during the discussion, connect the dots from

the participants’ discussion, and take notes. However, some activities

always require a human facilitator, such as: steering team dynamics,

reading the room, feeding the contextual nuances, extracting insights

that are relevant for the leadership, etc. This cannot (and shouldn’t) be

delegated to the AI.
