## to interpersonal rifts and power struggles.

The ideal scenario, of course, is to ﬁnd a cofounder who has the proper

skills and is also interpersonally compatible. But in reality, this can be

very diﬃcult to ﬁnd. Founders often struggle to convince others to leave

paid employment to work full-time on a new and untested startup idea.

Finding someone who not only wants to join a startup but also has

the necessary skillsets and is compatible with you — i.e. ﬁnding your

business soulmate — is exceedingly diﬃcult.

What makes it so diﬃcult to ﬁnd a cofounder? And what increases

the chances of ﬁnding one? To better understand these questions, we

collected data from the Y Combinator Cofounder Matching platform,

which is essentially a dating website for ﬁnding business partners.

Prospective partners create a proﬁle on the site and can swipe left

or right on potential business partners. We analyzed data on more

than 9,000 proﬁles on the site and performed text analysis on

their descriptions of the ideal cofounder, looking for whether they

focused more on skillsets, interpersonal compatibility, or both. We also

conducted a separate experiment with 769 individuals in which we presented them with a set of hypothetical cofounders that diﬀered in

skillsets and interpersonal traits (values, personality, etc.) and asked

them to choose their preferred one. In addition, we collected transcripts

of conversations between another 147 individuals participating in a

cofounder meetup event and manually reviewed each transcript to see

whether they focused more on skillsets or interpersonal compatibility
