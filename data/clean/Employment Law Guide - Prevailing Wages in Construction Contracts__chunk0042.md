The Copeland "Anti-Kickback" Act prohibits contractors from inducing any person employed in DBRA- covered construction to give up any part of the compensation to which they are entitled, and requires

contractors to submit a weekly statement of the wages paid to each worker performing DBRA-covered work.

Implementing regulations govern allowable payroll deductions.

Contractors on projects subject to Davis-Bacon labor standards may also be subject to overtime pay

requirements under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).

In addition to these federal labor standards, state and local prevailing wage and overtime pay requirements

may apply.
