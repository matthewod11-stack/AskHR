## A Multilevel Framework for Work Team Diversity Research

however, individuals are more likely to pick up cues that emphasize cooperation in the face of demographic dissimilarity. In an earlier study, Chatman, Polzer, Barsade, and Neale (1998) found that the positive effects of demographic diversity are more likely to emerge in organizations that emphasize organizational membership through a collectivistic orientation rather than in organizations that emphasize individualism and distinctive- ness. In a recent study, Ely and Thomas (2001) found that employees in bank branches that emphasized a learning perspective were more likely to view their racial diversity as a valuable resource even while performing race- neutral tasks. Together, these studies suggest that organizational culture can be a powerful inï¬‚uence on the extent to which the positive outcomes of diversity can materialize in work groups.
