## and notice ineﬃciencies in both the software development process and

the company’s recruitment strategy. While your passion and drive may

urge you to tackle both issues, overhauling the recruitment strategy might be more complex, requiring collaborative eﬀorts and a broad coalition to address eﬀectively. Fighting the recruitment battle can lead

to frustration, burnout, and an erosion of credibility if changes don’t

materialize quickly. And most likely, the recruitment team will respond

defensively to your initiative. Instead, focus your energy and resources

on streamlining the software development process, an area where you

can make a signiﬁcant and meaningful impact given your expertise.
