Use rituals to mark transitions. Top performers in many ﬁelds do this

to shift their attention and focus their minds. Wade Boggs, the former

third baseman for the Boston Red Sox, ate chicken before each game

and wrote the Hebrew symbol for chai (which means “life”) in the dirt

every time he went to bat. The tennis star Serena Williams bounces the

ball exactly ﬁve times before her ﬁrst serve and two times before her

second. The ballerina Suzanne Farrell pinned a small toy mouse inside

her leotard, crossed herself twice, and pinched herself twice before

going onstage.
