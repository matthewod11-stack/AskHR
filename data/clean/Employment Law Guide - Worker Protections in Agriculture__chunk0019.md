The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) is administered by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The Act

safeguards most migrant and seasonal agricultural workers in their interactions with farm labor contractors, agricultural employers, agricultural

associations, and providers of migrant housing. However, some farm labor contractors, agricultural employers, agricultural associations, and

providers of migrant housing are exempt from the MSPA under limited circumstances.

The MSPA requires farm labor contractors, agricultural employers, and agricultural associations, who recruit, solicit, hire, employ, furnish,

transport, or house agricultural workers, as well as providers of migrant housing, to meet certain minimum requirements in their dealings with

migrant and seasonal agricultural workers. These requirements include:

Farm labor contractor registration: Farm labor contractors (and any employee who performs farm labor contracting functions) must

register with the Department of Labor before recruiting, soliciting, hiring, employing, furnishing, or transporting any migrant or seasonal

agricultural worker. Agricultural employers and associations (and their employees) need not register as farm labor contractors.
