# 4.3 Scale translation

The items were originally developed in English but for the purposes of this research they demanded some additional adaptations. In the case of the Canadian bank, the sample consisted of English and French speaking respondents; in the case of the American manufacturer, there were Spanish speaking respondents.

English scales were translated into French and into Spanish using the parallel-blind technique (Guthery and Lowe, 1992; Mathieu et al., 2000). Two sets of translators were used: one for the English to French version, and the other one for the English to Spanish version. In the parallel-blind technique, two translators independently translated the scale from the source into the target language; after that, the translators compare their versions and work out their differences into a final version; the quality of the final result is high because it combines the advantages of individual results with a collaborative effort.
