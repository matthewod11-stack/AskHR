# Happiness and Job Performance

If, as we (and many others) have argued, happiness is a valuable but often lacking resource or commodity, one would expect unhappy people to be especially sensitive to negative cues that signal potential threats to their already limited supply of positive feelings (Cropanzano & Wright, 2001; Hobfoll, 1989; Lee & Ashforth, 1996). Alternatively, those individuals blessed with an abundance of positive feelings can afford to be less concerned with these negative threats (Wright, 2005). As a consequence, unhappy people can be presumed to be more sensitive to negative events, while happy people are more sensitive to positive events (Cropanzano & Wright, 2001; Staw, 2004; Staw & Cohen-Charash, 2005). A growing body of empirical research has undertaken to examine this important proposition in greater detail. Experimental research by Seidlitz and Diener (1993) and Seidlitz, Wyer, and Diener (1997) found that those who were low on well-being were more likely to encode an ambiguous event as threatening as compared with their happier counterparts. Likewise, Larsen and his colleagues (Larsen & Ketelaar, 1989, 1991; Rusting & Larsen, 1999; Zelenski & Larsen, 1999)
