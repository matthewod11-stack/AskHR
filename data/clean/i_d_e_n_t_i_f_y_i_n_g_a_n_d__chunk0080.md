# High-e(cid:12)ort/low-impact

26

Quick wins with strong impact and low e(cid:29)ort—often the best place to start building momentum.

The lowest-e(cid:29)ort projects that a single user might spin upS for themselves as a personal assistant on a given task.S Many start as individual solutions, but often becomeS valuable across teams.

Often transformational (like Moderna’s Dose GPT or Klarna’s customer assistant) but these use cases typically require more time, planning, and resources to build. Many teams start with quick wins to build momentum and use them as inspiration for investing in higher-value projects.

These can be safely put aside for now. But new products and capabilities might make them easier to build and deploy, so be open to promoting them.
