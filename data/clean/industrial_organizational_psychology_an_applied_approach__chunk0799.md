Race On the basis of the Civil Rights Acts of , , and , as well as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, it is illegal to discrimi- nate against a person based on race. According to Congress, the four races are African American, White, Asian American, and Native American Indian.

The equal protection clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments man- date that no federal or state agency may deny a person equal protection under the law. This implies that a government may not intentionally discriminate or allow intentional discrimination to take place. Because any suit filed under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment must demonstrate intent, they are not often invoked.

The Civil Rights Acts of  (known as Title VII) and  extended the scope of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the private sector and to local governments. Title VII makes it illegal for employers with more than  employ- ees and for labor unions, employment agencies, state and local governmental agencies, and educational institutions to:
