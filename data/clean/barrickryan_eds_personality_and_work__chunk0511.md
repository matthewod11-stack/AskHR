At a more molecular level, various studies have demonstrated the utility of these three Big Five traits and their lower-order facets in predicting a variety of more speciÔ¨Åc CWBs. For instance, re- searchers have demonstrated the utility of one or more of these traits as predictors of absenteeism (Judge, Martocchio, & Thoresen, 1997), turnover (Barrick & Mount, 1996), delinquency (Hough, 1992), workplace violence (Ones & Viswesvaran, 2001), substance abuse (Schmidt, Viswesvaran, & Ones, 1997), property damage (Ones & Viswesvaran, 1998), and a broad array of violent and non- violent criminal behaviors (Collins & Schmidt, 1993; Eysenck & Gudjonsson, 1988).
