# Camerer and Fehr, 2006)?

Asking about market and political outcomes forces behavioral economics to confront two classes of

questions that have not been the central focus of research so far: First, how heterogeneous are agents? And how

detectable is heterogeneity? (This question is important because heterogeneity drives the division of labor in

organizations, the development of expertise and human capital, and market interaction of rational and limitedly-

rational agents.) And second, how do institutions sort heterogeneous agents, supply market substitutes for

individual irrationality, and create organizational outcomes on the supply side?

Early theory: Some early papers tackled the issue of market aggregation theoretically. A pioneering

paper is Thaler and Russell (1985)11 who emphasized constraints that prevent rationality limits from being

erased. Haltiwanger and Waldman (1989) noted that whether individual mistakes would be erased or magnified

depends on whether behaviors are strategic substitutes or strategic complements. When behaviors are

complements, a small proportion of irrational traders can force others to behave irrationally (as Keynes wrote

about the stock market). The “limits to arbitrage” literature in finance is an extension of this general theme

(e.g., Shleifer, 2000).
