ABSTRACT:

"Workplace Stress and Well-being" is a crucial and multifaceted topic that examines the intricate relationship between the modern work environment and the mental and physical health of employees. In today's fast-paced and competitive corporate landscape, employees often encounter a myriad of stressors, ranging from excessive workloads and tight deadlines to interpersonal conflicts and job insecurity. This chronic stress can have detrimental effects on both individual well-being and organizational performance. Conversely, promoting employee well- being through various strategies such as flexible work arrangements, wellness programs, and a supportive workplace culture can lead to increased job satisfaction, productivity, and overall health. Understanding the dynamics of workplace stress and its impact on well-being is essential for employers and policymakers seeking to create healthier, more sustainable work environments that benefit both individuals and organizations alike.
