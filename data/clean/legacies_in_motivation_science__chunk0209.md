# Goals and Organizations

All organizations require goals; otherwise they have no purpose in being and would not achieve anything. A recent book by John Do- err (2018), inspired by goal-setting research,

provides a detailed method of how organiza- tions can and should use goal setting to be successful. Based on his work at Intel, he introduced Google’s leadership team to goal setting (based on a study by Locke), which is now a critical part of Google’s leadership strategy. Doerr explained the necessity of making goals transparent to all departments, thus making unethical behavior less likely. Similarly, Kerr and Lepelley (2013) described how G.E. managers, at the insistence of Jack Welch, set stretch goals, that is, goals that were arguably impossible to attain. These were set to stimulate creative outside-the-box thinking. No one was penalized for failure to attain these goals. Hence, no one was tempted to cheat or exaggerate goal attainment. Stretch goals were in addition to assigned minimum goals that did have to be attained.
