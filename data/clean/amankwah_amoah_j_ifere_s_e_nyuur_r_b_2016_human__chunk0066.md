# Contributions to theory and practice

Regarding theoretical implications, although strategic persistence has attracted a body of

research (Audia et al., 2000; Schwenk & Tang, 1989), there remains a lack of understanding

as to why companies persist with such workers. Our study seeks to fill this gap in the

literature by integrating theoretical concepts (i.e. the paradox of success, external legitimacy,

nepotism/cronyism and the “escalation of commitment” (Staw, 1981) in helping to offer a

more robust explanation of the subject. The integrated nature of the study accentuates the

robustness of examining issues in this research domain using multiple and integrative

approaches, instead of the narrow theoretical focus usually adopted in this research. This

approach adds to and extends previous research that examined these theoretical perspectives

separately. Second, the study proposed an enhanced unified framework of impelling forces

driving the incidence of persistence with underperforming employees in organisations. The

proposed unified framework in this study also provides a basis for scholars to further evolve

and develop an even more integrative perspective of the issues.

Another potential implication of our findings is that “laws in many developing

countries favour employees as they are seen as the 'weaker' party in the organization-

employee relationship” and therefore they have weak bargaining power and ability to

influence employers. In light of increasing global competition and needs to improve

government efficiency, government laws might have indirectly created conditions for

persistence with such workers. Finally, the finding that public sector institutions and non-

profit organisations are more likely to persevere with underperforming employees in this

high-relational context is novel and adds to the literature.

From a managerial standpoint, our analysis indicates that the ability to identify early

warning signals of seriously underperforming workers can help reduce later resources

required to undo or repair the damage to the business. There is a need to create an effective

mechanism to upgrade the expertise and knowledge of seriously underperforming and

“difficult to fire” employees to help reduce potential losses to the business. In addition,

weeding out underperforming workers can boost confidence of co-workers which would

impact on overall firm performance. This is also consistent with the assertion that weeding

out underperforming workers can equip firms to mitigate prolonged poor performance. More

importantly, weeding out such workers boosts confidence of co-workers. For firms in such

high-relational contexts, there is a need to identify an effective mechanism for dealing with

underperforming workers without imposing an additional burden on the decision-maker such

as the possibility of severing all ties with the individual.
