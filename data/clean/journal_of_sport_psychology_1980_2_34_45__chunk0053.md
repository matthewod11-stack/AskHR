It should be pointed out that the eigen values and variance of each factor were

different among the three solutions. However, the difference in the eigen values and associated variances are to be expected and should not be considered as evidence of instability of factor structure across situations. Since 40 of the 50 items had the highest loadings in the same factors across the three samples, it can be concluded that the factor structure is replicable.

Further Cattell's (1966) Scree test lends support for the present decision to extract five factors. Although the Scree test is somewhat outdated, it provides a rough estimate of the maximum number of factors to be extracted. In general.
