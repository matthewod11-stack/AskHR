# Emerging Management Practices

Many of the leaders we talked with initially tried to manage freelancers

the same way they’ve long managed other temporary workers: by relying on a contract agency for staﬃng and then maintaining a

transactional relationship with the workers that focused on speciﬁc

deliverables, with minimal investment by the company in developing

an emotional connection with them. But they soon learned that force-

ﬁtting the model they use for temporary staﬀ needs doesn’t work well

for freelancers. That’s not surprising. The role of traditional contractors

is staﬀ augmentation: They add capacity on a temporary basis and

perform outsourced, noncore work as employees of a third party. But

when the purpose is not augmentation but innovation, ﬁrms need a

diﬀerent approach—one that fully integrates expert freelancers into

a highly cohesive team. To that end, forward-looking companies are

starting to develop new practices.
