# process.

In a study by Van Dam, Oreg et al. (2008), the change process was evaluated by

three process variables; information, participation and trust in management, using a 7-

point Likert scale. One of the great findings in Oreg’s study was that “Trust in

management” is the only variable with significantly influences the affective, cognitive

and behavior dimensions. It is also worth stressing that “Information” influenced the

behavior and cognitive dimensions. Although it had been anticipated that there would be

an inverted relation with cognitive dimension, that is, the more information given, the

less resistance shown (based on the assumption that resistance is due to unfamiliarity

with details of change), the opposite was found to be true. Oreg himself points out a

possible explanation for it by stating that the relationship between information and

resistance “would therefore appear to depend on the content, rather than on the mere

existence of information. Furthermore, the manner in which the information is

communicated is also likely to influence change acceptance.” In fact, Oreg’s thinking

turns into provocative questioning not about investigating if information and participation

are provided but in which ways they are provided to lighten resistance to change. As

other authors alert, even when following classic prescriptions to deal with resistance by

informing and allowing participation, there are authentic and feigned ways to do so.

The claim here is that participation will never work if it is treated as a device to

get people to do what a change agent wants them to, as it could lead to deeper and

even more disguised resistance to change. Genuine participation is based on respect,

which comes from recognizing a real dependence on people’s contributions. This would

drive the agent to gather ideas and suggestions, not in a backhanded way to get

compliance, but in a straightforward way to gather some good ideas and avoid some

unnecessary mistakes. It would be possible to discuss, accept or reject ideas on their
