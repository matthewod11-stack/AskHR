prominence'' in the 1997 survey. Of respondents, 30 per cent indicated that feedback was a core development technique in their organisations. He deduces that the increased level of importance attached to performance feedback in the development process can be related to the increased adoption of 3608 feedback processes/ systems by organisations generally. In the UK, some one third of 119 companies surveyed by the Ashridge Management Research Group indicated that they have introduced a 3608 feedback programme (Handy et al., 1996). Towers Perrin conducted a study in early 1998 to explore how organisations plan, implement and use 3608 feedback as a means of collecting and presenting performance feedback from a variety of sources. They found that a large number of the respondents were either using or planning to use 3608 feedback in the near future. Only 19 per cent of respondents stated that they were not planning on using a 3608 feedback tool (Towers Perrin, 1998).

At a European level, at a conference held

in Lausanne in May 1999 by the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD), entitled ``3608 feedback: what works and what does not'', a number of organisations discussed the benefits of 3608 feedback. There were generally very positive reports about the effectiveness of multi-rater appraisal. For example, organisations such as Banverket (The Swedish National Rails Service), Eircom (in Ireland) and Bvlgari reported that the 3608 feedback experience in these organisations was quite positive. However, attention also focused on the pitfalls that are commonly encountered with 3608 feedback such as poor communication of the intentions of the system and the rating process itself.

The typical organisational members who are targeted as feedback recipients are upper and middle management levels. A survey of the members of the Society of HR Managers in the USA found that 35 per cent of organisations used 3608 feedback primarily for executives and 37 per cent for upper middle managers. Middle and first-level managers also received 3608 feedback but to a lesser extent (Ghorpade, 2000). The increasing amount of money being spent on training and development and 3608 feedback systems specifically, coupled with the prediction that it will in fact become a normal part of appraisal systems, points to the importance of studying the concept further.

The 36088 feedback process A typical 3608 feedback system involves numerous stages from the very outset, where the purpose of the system is determined, to the presentation of the feedback report to the feedback recipient. The steps outlined here represent a synthesis of the many models identified in the literature. These steps are as follows: 1 Decide on the purpose of 3608 feedback.

There are two main applications for 3608 feedback: employee development and performance evaluation. The purpose that the information gained from the 3608 feedback process is used for will determine the design and implementation of the whole process. The purpose has to be determined at the outset and communicated clearly to all the stakeholders involved.

2 Choose the instrument for collecting the data. The rating instruments consist mainly of questionnaires that are filled out by the various raters. However, some organisations use interviews, but these constitute the minority. The instrument can be developed in-house based on competencies that are deemed important to the organisation. Alternatively, the instrument can be purchased off-the-shelf from consultants. Instruments that are developed in-house have proven to be more effective than off-the-shelf products as they are organisation specific.

3 Decide on behaviours/items to be included

in the rating instrument. It is recommended to focus on actual employee behaviour in the workplace rather than general traits. Many commentators have proposed that the rating items should be based in some particular context so that there will be a reduction in rater error. The behaviours that are being rated should be drawn from the organisation's vision and values.

4 Decide who the feedback recipients are.

The group of employees to be targeted for receiving the feedback need to be determined. In the literature, it is espoused that the employees should volunteer to participate in the programme. Mandatory participation can be threatening and the effectiveness of the system is in jeopardy if the organisation forces employees to participate. 3608 feedback is a particularly useful tool in leadership development programmes because of the richness of the feedback that is provided by subordinates.
