Formalizing Accountability. In addition to taking actions to avoid means-end decoupling, another critical function of inclusive senior leadership is to minimize policy-practice decoupling (Mor Barak et al., pp. 840–871) by strengthening felt motivational signiﬁcance for implementation among leaders throughout levels of the organization. Motivational signiﬁcance de- pends on whether practice implementers perceive the espoused policies to be well suited for the attainment of shared goals and how vigilantly the im- plementation of those policies is monitored (Nishii et al. 2018). The more formalized the practices and the greater the accountability for practice im- plementation, the more likely it is for managers to enact practices as intended, thereby sending less ambiguous messages about what the practices mean for employees (Nishii et al., 2018; Nishii & Leroy, 2021). Espousals of an or- ganization’s commitment to inclusion and broad adoption of inclusion- focused practices could in fact backﬁre in the absence of accountability if the belief that they are indeed inclusive frees managers up to behave on the contrary (Castilla & Benard, 2010).

Mor Barak and her colleagues (pp. 840–871) offer an analysis of how policy-practice decoupling can occur both within the senior-leadership level of organizations, as well as between levels involving leader espousals and
