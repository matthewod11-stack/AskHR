# Intrapreneur Programs

Where do employees with big ideas go? Often, they make their big ideas

small to get approved easily, or they simply leave. History is witness

to how Steve Wozniak left HP because it wouldn’t do anything with

his design for an early personal computer — the Apple I. In fact, they

rejected it ﬁve times! Organizations serving the core business day-to-

day may hesitate to take the ideas on board because they don’t ﬁt their

operating model and may drain resources and take too long to pay oﬀ.

To ﬁght these challenges, companies need to provide a structured way

for idea champions to build out their concepts without over-committing

to them before they’re ready.
