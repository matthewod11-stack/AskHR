# Performance Appraisal

been accurately communicated or \\, hethci the message needs to be rex ised and encoded again. Wexley described as one of two primary objectives of appraisal inter\ iews feed- back to appraisees.19

Feedback is especially impor.. when the purpose of communication is instru- mental: that is, to obtain a behavioral response from the receiver of the message. When such messages are sent, feedback is best obtained by asking, "Now, tell me what you are going to do." The supervisor needs to know what is understood by the supervisee. When a subordinate is asked. "Do you understand?" Moe is considerable pressure to answer, "Yes." Otherwise, one's superior might think one is not intelligent.

We communicate best with those who have experiences similar to our own:. how- ever, few persons enjoy the luxury of communicating with a narrow iange of persons altogether similar to themselves. In Figure 5.1, the messages of A and B are shaded differently to commuricate the tact that their experiential backgrounds will "shade" their messages. Employees of higher educational institutions now represent a broader range of cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic baLkgiound than in the past.:, Communi- cator differences in experiential background can cause senders and receivers to attach quite different meanings to the same words and objects to the extent that messages sent are not identical to messages received. Sensitivity and efforts to increase knowledge of diverse groups are called for. Appraise' who \\, ISh to improve communication must learn to hear messages from the "frame of reference" of others.

The needs of those communicating can cause breakdown in communication. The sender may feel a need to put the recei, er "in his or her place." The iece;ver ma) feel threatened when communicating with the sender. Both sender and receiver can enhance the likelihood of effective communication b) being as aware' as possible of boil' his/her own needs and those of the person with \110111 they communique, however, this is especially a responsibility of the leader/appraiser. Such awareness can reduce defensive behavior and rid the interaction of communication distoitions that defensiveness elicits and sustains. Figure 5 2 represents two basic needs of every person, the need to protect oneself and the need to enhance oneself. When these needs ale threatened or thwarted communication will break down.

It is important to communication effectiveness that senders communicate clearly their expectations In most performance appraisal inter\ iew s appraiseis send messages that attempt to elicit a behavioral response, that is, an mil umental sespouse. Unless senders make expectations explicit, the dcsu ed [espouse 0, ill not be forthcoming. There is appreciable evidence in suppoil of the' so- called Pygmalion effect, that persons generi:ly respond to expectations Ilowe\ er, if expectations aic not cleat and responses are not those sought, inappropriate assuic,;:,ions about the competency of a subordinate may be made when, in fact, that assumption is not justified.

Beliefs of both sender and receiver create difficulties in communication. Napier and Latham draw from social learning theory to identify two Lognitive variables which
