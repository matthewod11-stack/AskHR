# actions and behaviors in general.

A continuous exchange of messages can allow new meanings to develop, and

these will stem from changes in each individual’s original meanings, which can lead to a

process of meaning convergence that can be understood as the beginning of

communication, the possession of something in common. It is worthwhile to alert, on the

other hand, that a broad provision of initiatives and communication tools do not

necessarily lead to successful change, in terms of intended results. That is, it is not only

the quantity but mainly the quality, or as Reis (2002) warns, the nature of the

communicative mediation implemented that can influence change. Here there is a

distinction in the nature of communication strategies. Those whose role or function is

that of justifying and rationalizing change will make use of traditional communication

techniques that are usually used to systematize, disseminate and express information.

In such cases, change is communicated to the staff (Caldwell, 1993) and, even when

the means and messages are intensified in number and sophistication while various

resources are invested, they may not lead to reduced resistance to change due to their

not privileging the building of shared meanings.

Conversely, communication strategies whose role or function is to refine and

align change can be more successful at reducing individual resistance to change, as

they allow the meaning attributed to change to be constantly re-elaborated by means of

cyclical contributions within the cognitive process of its interlocutors. To put it another

way, they can produce two-way communicational structures by encouraging learning

through mistake and dialogic interaction. They incorporate, structurally or within their

dynamics, the possibility of participation, of inclusiveness (Reis, 2004.), or even, as

Lewis (2007) advocates, they can be better configured as an input focus than as a

dissemination focus. Aligned with that, Elving (2005) stated that communication “aims

for the creation of mutual understanding and trusting relationships”.

The connection between communications and organizational change has been

attracting increasing interest from scholars and practitioners during the last decade

(Johansson and Heide, 2008). Several of them have emphasized the important role of
