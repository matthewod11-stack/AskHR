# “Pay less” bias

Many women expressed dismay that they were seen as less deserving

ﬁnancially because they were “not working to support a family.” One

professional who was single with no kids learned that a male coworker

hired at the same level was paid more because “he was married with

a family to feed.” After another male colleague wrote to the manager

and got a raise because he was a newlywed and expecting a child, this

woman asked for a pay increase. According to our research participant,

the manager replied that “business was bad, and he would review in six

months’ time.” Another woman’s boss explicitly stated, “I like to hire

women because I can pay them less because they don’t have to support

their family.” There is still a pervasive view that women’s earnings — no

matter their family status — are optional or “just for fun.”
