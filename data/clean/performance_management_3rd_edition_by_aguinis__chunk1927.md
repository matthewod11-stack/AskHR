# Chapter 11 • Managing Team Performance

Feedback should be Feedback and coaching. given often during the performance management process so that there are no unexpected surprises at the end of the year. The feedback process involves

- Ongoing feedback and coaching. Throughout the year, the supervisor should call attention to both good behaviors and those that need improvement.

- An interim review. Around the middle of the per- formance cycle, the employee and supervisor will meet to discuss performance and expected job results that need to be modified. During this time, improvement opportunities for the remainder of the year will be identified.

- Assigning overall performance rating. Fifty per- cent of the rating is based on job results, and 50% is based on behaviors.

- Conducting the formal performance review. The formal meeting gives the employee time to discuss past performance and areas for continued growth.

- Performance rating standards. These ratings are the following: Below Expectations (significant improvement is needed), Achieved Expectations (consistently demonstrated expected and effective behaviors), and Exceeded Expectations (consis- tently demonstrated role model behaviors and exceeded expected job results).

- Obtaining and documenting feedback. The super- visor will document the individual’s performance based on feedback from a variety of sources, including (1) his or her own direct observation; (2) third-party reports from customers, peers, direct reports (if any), and managers with whom the employee interacts; and (3) the employee’s own self- assessment.

Evaluation. This is the formal documentation of the performance results for the year. Evaluation and devel- opment link individual performance expectations (established at the beginning of the year) with depart- ment, entity, and broad organizational goals. This part of the performance process includes the following:

- Assessing individual performance. The employee and the supervisor assess performance during the year based on the job results and behavior expected.

Reward. The final step of the performance manage- ment system is the reward. Pay and performance are designed to reward those who contribute to the success of the Health System, and employees are evaluated at the end of the fiscal year. The success of the Health System is measured in terms of the goals in the DUHS balanced scorecard, which consists of (1) Clinical Quality/Internal Business, (2) Customer Service, (3) Work Culture, and (4) Finances. The individual’s merit increase is based on two factors: (1) the organizational success and (2) individual and team contribution to that success, as reflected in the individual’s overall performance.

Consider the performance management process (see Figure 11.2) from a team point of view. Using the table here, describe whether each of the components in the process is implemented at Duke University. In some cases, a component may be partially present or present under a different name. Please indicate this when appropriate. (cid:2)
