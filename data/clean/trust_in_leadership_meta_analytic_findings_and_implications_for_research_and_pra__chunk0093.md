Readers should also use caution in drawing conclusions about causality among variables. We classified variables as antecedents or consequences on the basis of how they tend to be theoretically positioned in the existing literature. The majority of studies con- ducted on trust in leadership, however, have been correlational and are not longitudinal. Consequently, a meta-analysis is not able to confirm or disconfirm causality, as there may be multiple viable explanations for an observed correlation (e.g., effect of a third variable, reverse causality). The limitation suggests that future research should be conducted to limit these threats to validity. Laboratory experiments, which represent a small minority of the studies included in the meta-analysis, can provide evidence about the validity of causal hypotheses. Field experiments such as Mayer and Davisâ€™s (1999) study of how performance appraisal systems can be altered to improve trust provide another option. For corre- lational studies, researchers may follow examples by Pillai et al. (1999), who attempted to take into account and causally model the relationships between a number of variables. It is also possible that trust has relationships with some variables in which causality is
