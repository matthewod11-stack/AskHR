# into cohesive workflows.

The architecture of Agentspace Enterprise is founded upon several core principles.

Paramount among these is built-in trust, which prioritizes security, explainability, and

governance through features such as single sign-on (SSO) authentication, an integrated

permissions model, and user-level access controls. Google's advanced intelligence is

leveraged to discern user behavior and content patterns through machine learning, resulting

in the delivery of highly relevant results via semantic understanding, knowledge graphs,

and LLMs. Universal connectivity is achieved by connecting to a diverse array of enterprise

systems with on-demand and automated data refreshes, thereby eliminating information

silos. Enterprise-level customization and user-level personalization are facilitated through

granular controls for search functionality, recommendations, LLMs, and knowledge graphs,

providing tailored experiences based on individual user roles, permissions, and search

of results through machine learning and user input. Blended Retrieval Augmented Generation

(RAG) allows for customizable data blending, powering generative AI applications grounded

in enterprise data. Finally, scalability is a critical design consideration, with the system

engineered to accommodate growth across geographical regions, languages, and peak
