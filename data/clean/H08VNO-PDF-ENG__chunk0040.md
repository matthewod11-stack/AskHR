# Pro Tip

Kill one popular perk this quarter. Use that budget to solve a known

workﬂow or management pain point—something employees have been

ﬂagging but leaders have been avoiding. Then tell people exactly why

you’re doing it. Signal that culture isn’t just about caring—it’s about

ﬁxing what’s broken.
