# failures?

Another way to say that is: What’s the right frequency of

experimentation? How often should we be trying new things to push the envelope, to discover new possibilities, even to discover eﬃciencies?

And are we doing that often enough? The answer is usually no, because

most of us would rather succeed than fail, and most of us would rather

keep doing what we’re doing because we’re kind of good at it.
