## discharge. "Congress has authorized the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

(EEOC) to enforce compliance with the act's provisions against discrimination in

complaints have risen over the past years however; this should not deter any person from

pursuing a claim.

An employee who feels they were the victims of discrimination may go to the

EEOC and based off filing a claim in good faith, he or she initiates an investigation

process. Sometimes employees have a reasonabie expectation that the employer will

retaliate against them. The phrases engaging in protective activity is utilized by the EEOC

for person( s) who meet a certain criteria. Protective activity is, "filing a charge,

a white male that complains about the retaliation against an African American male is also

protected. The extension goes further to include those who may associate with the person

who is protected, and this could mean a spouse or a family member.

agencies or technical contract firms are to be generally considered employees - not

independent contractors - of the client company'' (Reynold, 1998, p. 10). In essence, the

temps who are paid by a temp agency but working on the property of another company

are subject to the same employment protection as the employee for the company. What

this means is that an employee may sue the temp agency or the compa.lly they are assigned

or both parties, if they feel they were discriminated against. The discrimination could be

age, sex, disability, equal pay, a non bona fide occupational qualification, religion or

national origin. Staffing agencies are a rising source of employees from employers, which
