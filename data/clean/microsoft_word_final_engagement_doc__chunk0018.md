## Employer Actions at the Organizational Level

A company can also try to prevent the kinds of problems that lead to disengagement in the first place. Some of the most effective organizational level prevention tools include ensuring a better fit of the employee with the work environment, providing practical on-the-job support, improving general working conditions, and creating a supportive corporate culture.31 Each of these tactics warrants examination.

Employee-Work Environment Fit. Employee engagement can be improved through better job design. The specific elements and tasks assigned to certain jobs can be redesigned to better match the strengths of particular employees.32 More broadly, employees can be matched with the kinds of jobs and work colleagues that most closely match their abilities and talents – what is referred to as “person-environment fit.” 33, 34 The general idea is to put more effort from the company side into conducting assessments of employee attributes, interests, and job skills and then to use these individual profiles to proactively match work tasks and positions to an individual employee’s strengths and interests. This kind of person- environment fit should increase the level of employee work engagement. Conversely, when this is not done, employees may decide to seek out other jobs within the organization that interest them and take advantage of their skills and talents. Some employees may even leave a company altogether to look for work at other organizations that appear to offer a work culture that is a better fit with their career path and occupational skills. Indeed, providing challenging jobs and interesting work is one the best ways for a company to create working conditions that lead to high engagement experiences for employees and increases employee loyalty as well.19

Support and Resources. Low work productivity and employee disengagement are both associated with low levels of support from supervisors and co-workers. For example, a review of 63 studies on work environments and psychological well-being found consistent research support for the idea that employees

have the highest well-being when their work is characterized by a high level of personal control over specific job elements, a low level of pressures and demands on when and how the work is done, and when there is a high level of social support from others at work.35 Similar results were obtained in a meta-analysis study of findings from 73 prior research studies. This review found that low levels of perceived organizational support predicted increased job strain symptoms among employees, such as feeling fatigued, anxious, or having headaches.36 A recent study of school teachers found that work engagement was improved when the institution offered more support and job resources (e.g., supervisor support, positive appreciation, collaborative organizational climate, and innovative problem solving).37 This line of research suggests that providing relevant kinds of job resources can buffer the negative impact of stressful job demands and poor working conditions, thereby increasing employee work engagement.

Working Conditions. Organizations should seek to avoid creating overly difficult job demands and stressful working conditions, as these factors are the main predictors of employee exhaustion and burnout.38 Efforts to mitigate these factors can include changing characteristics of job tasks and technical operations, adopting more ergonomic workplace equipment, adding flexibility to work schedules and workload, improving role clarity and the decision-making authority of workers, and fostering positive social relationships at work.

Corporate Culture and Leadership. The culture of an organization can affect employee work stress in general and can influence employee engagement in particular. Reviews of the research in this area show that organizational culture is an important component of work stress and may be a key to creating effective organizational stress interventions.39 Results from the Towers Perrin studies indicate that five of the ten most important drivers of employee engagement involve leadership style and organizational factors.19 Organizational culture can be modified to achieve some of the attributes that contribute to employee engagement. Possible changes include senior management having a sincere interest in employee well-being, business actions that create a good reputation in the area of corporate social responsibility, and establishing opportunities for career advancement

within the organization. Employee work engagement is one of the five criteria (based on a review of research literature) for the annual Healthy Workplace Awards given to employers by the American Psychological Association.40 The other four criteria of a healthy workplace culture include: Supporting work/life balance, fostering employee growth and development, encouraging health and safety on the job, and providing praise and recognition.

Essentially, employees are more engaged in their work when the organizational culture is psychologically healthy and when management of the company acts in ways that make employees proud to work there. All of the engagement studies in the United States and other countries conclude that it is up to the senior leadership of an organization to set the tone in this area.
