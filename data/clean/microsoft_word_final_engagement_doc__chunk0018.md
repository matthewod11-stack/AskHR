# Barriers to Engagement

The research also reveals some barriers to employee engagement that present challenges for organizations.41 Some of the practices to avoid include:

- (cid:32)

Inconsistent management styles based on the attitudes of individual managers, which can lead to perceptions of unfairness.

- (cid:32) Reactive decision making by superiors that does not address workplace problems until after it is too late.

- (cid:32) Lack of knowledge-sharing within the company due to rigid communication channels or company culture norms.

- (cid:32) Poor workâ€“life balance for staff due to having to regularly work too many hours within a company culture that supports frequent use of overwork schedules.

issues include: How closely is engagement tied to mental health? Is engagement more closely tied to individual or to organizational factors, and can they be separated? How does engagement differ for various kinds of employees, companies, and industries? How readily can engagement be improved and what is the most effective way of doing this? How is work engagement related to employee presenteeism (a term originating from occupational medicine research that describes a reduced level of work performance due to illness or other health conditions)? Hopefully future investigations will provide answers these and other questions.
