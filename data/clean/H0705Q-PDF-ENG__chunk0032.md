# comfortable monthly pension.

While Bill felt that he and his parents were allowing enough time to

make a decision without too much time pressure, he realized that they’d

all focused on annual costs without a good understanding of what

future medical expenses might be. But perhaps that was unknowable;

there was likely a limit on how much the family could really plan.

Although Bill’s parents found two facilities that met many of their

criteria, each had a fatal ﬂaw. At one place, although they could buy

in to the type of housing they needed now, there was no guarantee that

housing with more care would be available when they needed it. The

second facility, they realized, meant they would have to change primary

care doctors because the drive would become too long. Both very much

wanted to maintain their relationship with their primary care doctors,

as they each had complex medical histories.

making, ask yourself:

- What are the opportunities and limitations of the decision you are

about to make?

- Is there a time deadline?

- Might the decision be ﬂexible or constrained by money or other
