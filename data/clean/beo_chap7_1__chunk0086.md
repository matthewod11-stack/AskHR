# BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS OF ORGANIZATIONS

These issues are highlighted by putting incentive conflicts aside and focusing

on organizations as “teams.” A team has a common interest, but has to coordinate

activity and information to make a commonly beneficial choice (see Radner and

Van Zandt 2001). Coordination is often neglected in organizational economics, per-

haps because of a belief that it is easy to achieve. Indeed, in small groups a quick

e-mail may coordinate activity. But when organizations face time pressure, have

rapid turnover, and scale up in size, coordination is challenging.

Experimental studies of coordination games have shown that even in very simple

settings, with modest group sizes (2-16) and very clear games, coordination failure is common. Several studies have used a “weak-link” game!®: players simultaneously

choose effort levels (integers from 1~7) and earn an amount which increases in the

minimum effort, as well as a penalty if their effort is above the minimum. The game is

tricky because there is one incentive to choose high numbers, to raise the minimum,

and another incentive to choose low numbers, to avoid the penalty from wasted

effort. Every effort level is a different equilibrium, but choosing the highest effort

is Pareto-dominant.

Many studies show that coordination failure in groups playing simultaneously

without communication: they generally fail to reach the Pareto-dominant equilib-

rium (see, for example, Van Huyck et al. 1990; Camerer 2003, Chapter 7). Efficiency

can be achieved when two people play together repeatedly, when groups “grow”

slowly, starting with two and adding one player at a time (Weber 2006), or when a

small bonus is publicly announced if everyone reaches the efficient choices (Knez

and Camerer 1994; Brandts and Cooper 2004). Surprisingly, limited communica-

tion does not help much (cf. Cooper et al. 1994). When one “leader” is randomly

chosen to talk briefly to the group (usually exhorting everyone to choose “7”), large

groups still do not reach efficiency and subjects misattribute credit and blame to the
