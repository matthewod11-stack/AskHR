# The Return of Diagnosis

One consequence of the hegemony of psychoanalysis in U.S. psychiatry was the diminution of interest in formal diagnosis. Patient evaluations typically oriented to a description of the hypothesized psychodynamics supposed to underlie the clin- ically manifest behavior. The decision as to what diagnostic label to attach to the patient’s case was often considered a bu- reaucratic requirement for statistical reports but of no great signiﬁcance in patient treatment. In 1952, the American Psy- chiatric Association published the ﬁrst Diagnostic and Statis- tical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-I). The categories employed conceived of mental disorders largely as personal- ity reactions to various factors; biological, psychological, and social. It was replaced in 1968 by DSM-II, to bring it into line with the Eighth edition of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD-8).

In later years, further revisions included DSM-III in 1980, DSM III-R (revised) in 1987, and DSM-IV in 1994, and DSM IV-TR in 2000. These successive versions included an increasing number of disorders and increasingly detailed cri- teria for deﬁnition of diagnostic categories. Research into various forms of psychopathology based upon this classiﬁca- tion system has permitted more conﬁdent comparison of pa- tient samples from different hospitals and from different countries, an essential requirement if independent replication of ﬁndings is to be established.
