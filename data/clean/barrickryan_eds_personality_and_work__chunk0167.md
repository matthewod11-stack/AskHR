# Health and Coping

In addition to the direct effects of happiness on work behavior, well-being may have additional indirect beneﬁts for worker pro- ductivity and organizational efﬁciency. For example, researchers have shown that happy individuals have better health and coping outcomes than do unhappy individuals. Most of the research in this area has focused on the effects of negative affect and stress on health and immune functioning, and these studies often ﬁnd that individuals with higher levels of stress and negative affect have poorer health outcomes (Salovey, Rothman, Detweiler, & Steward, 2000; Sapolsky, 1999). However, it is also possible that positive emo- tional and cognitive well-being may have similar effects or may at least moderate the effects of negative moods and stress. Correla- tional studies of mood and immune functioning over time (Stone, Cox, Valdimarsdottir, Jandorf, & Neale, 1987; Stone et al., 1994) and experimental studies of induced mood and immune func- tioning (Dillon, Minchoff, & Baker, 1986; Futterman, Kemeny, Shapiro, & Fahey, 1994) provide evidence that positive moods and immune functioning are linked.
