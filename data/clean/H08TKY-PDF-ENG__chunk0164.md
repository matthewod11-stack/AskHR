which to let ripen, and which to toss, companies make decisions based

on what they know now, what might happen in the future, and which

opportunities have already passed.

to build or buy them; and 2) volatility, or how much things can

change before an investment decision must Ô¨Ånally be made. Mapping

opportunities based on these two metrics can help leaders decide what

actions to take and where to place their bets.
