## well-regarded brand with yearly revenue of about $750 million, but it

had a stagnant product line and yearly revenue growth of only 2%. (Two

of us, Duke and Will, are executives at Ajax.)

Prior to the purchase, the Ajax team and its investor partners had

reviewed Cordis’s product portfolio and identiﬁed signiﬁcant gaps

in multiple product ranges, such as products targeting circulatory

problems and others treating cardiac complaints. They would establish
