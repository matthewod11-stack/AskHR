# Penalties/Sanctions

Upon receipt of a timely complaint, OSHA notiﬁes the employer and, if conciliation fails, conducts an

investigation. Where OSHA ﬁnds that complaints ﬁled under the OSH Act, AHERA, and ISCA have merit, they

are referred to the Solicitor's Oﬃce for legal action. Complaints under these three statutes found not to have merit will be dismissed. Where OSHA ﬁnds a violation after investigating complaints under the other statutes

listed above, it will issue a determination letter requiring the employer to pay back wages, reinstate the

employee, reimburse the employee for attorney and expert witness fees, and take other steps to provide

necessary relief. Complaints found not to have merit will be dismissed.

Parties who object to OSHA's determinations under the other statutes listed above (except for the OSH Act, AHERA, and ISCA) may request a hearing before the Department of Labor's Oﬃce of Administrative Law

Judges (OALJ)(http://www.oalj.dol.gov). Administrative Law Judges' decisions are reviewed by the Department

of Labor's Administrative Review Board(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/arb), which the Secretary of Labor has

designated to issue ﬁnal agency decisions.

Under STAA, if OSHA ﬁnds in favor of the employee, litigation ordinarily is conducted by the Solicitor's Oﬃce, but sometimes by the private party. Under the other statutes, litigation generally is conducted by the private

parties themselves. Employers and employees may seek judicial review of an adverse Administrative Review
