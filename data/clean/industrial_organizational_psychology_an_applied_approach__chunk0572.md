# Determining Internal Pay Equity

Internal pay equity involves comparing jobs within an organization to ensure that the people in jobs worth the most money are paid accordingly. Th e diﬃ culty in this process, of course, is determining the worth of each job. Because a complete discussion of all job evaluation methods is beyond the scope of this text, we will stick to a discussion of the most commonly used method.

Step 1: Determining Compensable Job Factors Th e ﬁ rst step in evaluating a job is to decide what factors diﬀ erentiate the relative worth of jobs. Possible compensable job factors include:

7 7 7 7 7 7

Level of responsibility Physical demands Mental demands Education requirements Training and experience requirements Working conditions

Th e philosophical perspectives of the job evaluator can aﬀ ect these fac- tors. Some evaluators argue that the most important compensable factor is

responsibility and that physical demands are unimportant. Others argue that education is the most important. Th e choice of compensable factors thus is often more philosophical than empirical.

Step 2: Determining the Levels for Each Compensable Factor Once the compensable factors have been selected, the next step is to determine the levels for each factor. For a factor such as education, the levels are easy to determine (e.g., high school diploma, associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree). For factors such as responsibility, a considerable amount of time and discussion may be required to determine the levels.

Step 3: Determining the Factor Weights Because some factors are more important than others, weights must be assigned to each factor and to each level within a factor. Here is the process for doing this:

. A job evaluation committee determines the total number of points that will be distributed among the factors. Usually, the number is some multiple of  (for example, , , ,) and is based on the number of compensable factors. Th e greater the number of factors, the greater the number of points.

. Each factor is weighted by assigning a number of points. Th e more important the factor, the greater the number of points that will be assigned.

. Th e number of points assigned to a factor is then divided into each of the levels. If  points had been assigned to the factor of education, then  points ( points/ degrees) would be assigned to each level. An example of this procedure is shown in Table .. Th e job evaluation committee takes the job descriptions for each job and assigns points based on the factors and degrees created in the previous steps. . Th e total number of points for a job is compared with the salary

currently being paid for the job. Th is comparison is typically graphed in a fashion similar to the wage trend line shown in Figure .. Wage trend lines are drawn based on the results of a regression formula in which salary is predicted by the number of job analysis points. Jobs whose point values fall well below the line (as with Job D in Figure .) are considered underpaid (“green circled”) and are immediately assigned higher salary levels. Jobs with point values well above the line (as with Job H) are considered overpaid (“red circled”) and the salary level is decreased once current jobholders leave.
