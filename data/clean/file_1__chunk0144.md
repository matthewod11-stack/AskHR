# 3.3.2. Key operationalisation

Key variables of the last thesis paper include pay inequity and organizational commitment. Aligned with Gerhart (1990), the magnitudes of differences in current salaries of employees were examined controlling for both key supply- and demand-side factors. On the supply side, standard measures of the amount of human capital were used (i.e., job tenure, supervisory position, type of contract, and educational degree). On the demand side, job content was controlled through the use of job titles and supervisory performance appraisals. The residual of this function were used to study reactions to pay inequity. A negative value indicates that the person is receiving less than typical in the universities taking account the above mentioned demand- and supply factors. A positive value indicates that the person is getting paid more than is typical (based on individual negotiations, some other informal procedures or exceptions to the main policy).

The strength of organizational commitment was measured by three items introduced by Klein (2008). The items included: ‘how committed are you to your organization?’, ‘how dedicated are you to your organization?’, and ‘to what extent do you feel bound to the future of the organization?’ The items were measured with 5-point scale ranging from 1 = Little if at all to 5 = A great extent. The alpha coefficient was .92.
