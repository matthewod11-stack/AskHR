job. Job analysis interviews come in two main forms: individual and group. In the individual interview, the job analyst interviews only one employee at a time. In the group interview, or SME conference, a larger number of employees are inter- viewed together. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, individual interviews tend to yield similar results to group interviews.

With a committee-based approach, a committee of SMEs meets to brainstorm the major duties involved in a job. Once this has been done, the committee identi- ﬁ es the tasks (work-related activities) that must be completed for each of the duties. Th e results are then summarized in job descriptions or a job analysis report.

An excellent job analysis interview technique was developed by Ammerman () and reported by Robinson (). Th e basic steps for the Ammerman technique are:
