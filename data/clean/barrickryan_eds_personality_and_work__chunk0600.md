The primary method of assessing team personality is thus to mea- sure and aggregate individual-level measures. In essence, each of the current approaches suggests that team-level personality can be assessed through measuring and statistically combining individual- level traits. This approach can be justiﬁed theoretically. However, little effort has been directed toward assessing whether team traits can be reliably assessed with measures targeted speciﬁcally at team- level perceptions. Can available individual-level trait measures be adapted to measure traits at the team level of analysis reliably? If team traits change with tasks, are team-level traits stable enough to label as personality? One method of assessing this is to ask team members and observers to provide measures of regularities and patterns for the collective group. In essence, this is what Chan (1998) refers to as a referent-shift consensus composition model, where individuals provide data but the target of their response is the team as a whole rather than an individual. Future research should compare this cross-level approach to measurement with cur- rently adopted measures that aggregate individual-level traits. Such
