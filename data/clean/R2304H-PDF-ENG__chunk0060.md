Employing people with disabilities is a worthy cause. But portraying it

as such masks the fact that it can deliver real beneﬁts to organizations.

When Andrea Girlanda, the CEO of Auticon, sent his customary note

thanking one of the ﬁrm’s large clients (the head of data analytics at

a multinational pharmaceutical company) for making a diﬀerence in

the lives of disabled people, he received a swift but concise reply: “Stop

thanking me; I am not doing this from the kindness of my heart. Your

consultants are great; we are doing things so much better than before.”

The creative director of La Casa de Carlota holds a similar view. “Lots of

people think that we are being kind by working with people who have

autism or Down syndrome, but I don’t feel I’m being kind; I feel I’m

being clever!” the director says. “I’m tapping into their unique form of

creativity, which hasn’t been used to its full potential in the creative

industries up till now.” There is nothing wrong with wanting to do good

in the world, but there is also nothing wrong with wanting to do well,

and the latter is enough reason to employ people with disabilities.
