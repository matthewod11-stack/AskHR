encourage followers to accept and comply with the leadersâ€™ ideas without voicing dissent.

In addition, research has begun to explore the impact of destructive forms of

leadership and their effect on outcomes via trust. Destructive leadership styles refer to

voluntary acts committed by a leader which most people would perceive as harmful and

supervisors engage in ongoing displays of verbal and non-verbal hostility (Tepper, 2000).

Examples of abusive supervision include humiliating employees in pubic, mocking,

belittlement, rudeness, breaking promises and other inappropriate behaviours (Tepper, 2000).

In accordance with SET, trust should decrease over time as a result of these unfavourable

exchanges with a leader which may even contribute to feelings of distrust of the leader

(Tepper, 2007).
