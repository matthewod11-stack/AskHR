# Burt’s Theory

Sir Cyril Burt (1949), known primarily for this widely ques- tioned work on the heritability of intelligence, suggested that a ﬁve-level hierarchy would capture the nature of intelli- gence. At the top of Burt’s hierarchy was “the human mind.” At the second level, the “relations level,” are g and a practi- cal factor. At the third level are associations, at the fourth level is perception, and at the ﬁfth level is sensation. This model has not proven durable and is relatively infrequently cited today.
