# Testing the Program

It’s hard to judge the success of such incentive-based programs without

running a controlled study. How can you really know if the right people

are quitting, or if those who stay get a moral boost from doing so? To

ﬁnd out, you need to run an experiment that includes a control group

that is not oﬀered the incentives, which you can compare to a group that

is oﬀered them.
