# Block out rehearsal time.

Layoﬀ preparation should not be rushed. Skimming a script that has been written by a communications team is not suﬃcient preparation.

Yet too often, this is what I see executives do. Instead, remember the

elementary school mantra: practice makes perfect.

Once the announcement date is on the calendar, block out rehearsal

time, ideally a few days before the announcement. Use this time to

make sure the messaging is written and approved by legal several days

before the announcement, and that you have ample time to review the

script, make any changes, and read through it several times.

You may think you don’t need that much time to prepare — but you

do need it. You must be comfortable with the material to come oﬀ as

conﬁdent, calm, and trustworthy. You also need time to break down the

talk into bullet points and know exactly what to convey at each point.
