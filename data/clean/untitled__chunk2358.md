# Training Program Development

For psychology trainees desiring to work in the schools, rec- ommended curricula were available at several colleges and universities. In the late 1920s, New York University estab- lished the ﬁrst programs speciﬁcally titled “school psychol- ogy” leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees and even the doctorate (Fagan, 1999). In the late 1930s, Pennsylvania StateUniversityalsoestablishedgraduatesequencesforschool psychologists, although a speciﬁc school psychology doctoral program was not available until much later. By the end of the period, few training programs were speciﬁcally titled “school psychology,” and most personnel continued to be trained in general experimental psychology, educational and clinical psychology, and teacher-education-related programs.
