transplanting practices from one complex system to another rarely

yields the same results. Various parts of a company may adopt diverse

management practices that serve their own purposes even when they

operations. Division leaders, tasked with achieving daunting ﬁnancial

targets, come to view corporate strategy sessions as irrelevant to their

personal responsibilities. They spend most of that meeting time on their

devices, communicating with their units instead of collaborating with

their peers. Eventually this disunity causes a company to operate like

a collection of loosely aﬃliated businesses—and its shares to trade at

conglomerate discounts. That leads to communication breakdowns, lost

synergies, and increased overhead costs associated with the additional

supervision and conﬂict resolution required to compensate for the lack
