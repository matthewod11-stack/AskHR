## a fundamental impact on your organization’s performance. Can you

exist without or easily replace the stakeholder? Do you clearly know

what you want from the stakeholder? Do you want the relationship with

that stakeholder? In the case of a business, your key stakeholders are

most likely to include some or all of these ﬁve: customers, suppliers,

employees, shareholders, and the community. These are the groups that

must form your plan structure.

As part of your review, quantify what you want from each of these

stakeholders, and what they want from you. You can follow some steps

to do that. For example, you want revenue from customers, and they

want a range of things from you including quality products, customer

service, and a competitive price–each of which incurs an expense. So,

one metric that should appear in your strategic plan, and for which you

should have targets over time, is revenue. With employees, you may

seek high retention, engagement, or productivity. With suppliers, you

might target improved terms or greater reliability.

By structuring your strategic plan around stakeholder-based results,

you’re laying a foundation that can be linked directly to ﬁnancial

performance. You’re also building clarity: everyone in your organization

can see whom you’re trying to inﬂuence and how.
