Amount of Information The amount of information contained in a message can affect the accuracy with which it is received. When a message contains more information than we can hold in memory, the information becomes leveled, sharpened, and assimilated. For example, suppose a friend told you the following message over the phone:

John Atoms worked in Detroit for the automobile manufacturer General Floaters Corporation. He came to work on Tuesday morning wearing a brown shirt, plaid pants, white socks, and dark shoes. He leaned forward, barfed all over the floor, and then passed out. He was obviously intoxi- cated. He had worked for the company for  years, so they didn’t want to fire him, but they had to do something. The company decided to suspend him for a few days and place him on probation. They were especially sensitive to his problems because he was on his eighth marriage.

What would the story sound like if you passed it on to a friend? When you level some of the information, unimportant details are removed. For example, information about the color of the employee’s shirt and socks would probably not be passed along to the next person. When you sharpen the information, interesting and unusual information is kept. In the example here, the employee’s “barfing” and his eight marriages would probably be the story’s main focus as it is passed from you to your friend. When you assimilate the information, it is modified to fit your existing beliefs and knowledge. Most of us have never heard of the last name Atoms, but we probably have known someone named “Adams.” Likewise, “General Floaters” might be passed along as General Motors. You would probably use the word drunk rather than intoxicated.

Reactions to Communication Overload With many jobs, communication overload can occur when an employee receives more communication than he can handle. When an employee is overloaded, she can adapt or adjust in one of several ways to reduce the stress: omission, error, queuing, escape, using a gatekeeper, or using multiple channels.

Omission. One way to manage communication overload is omission: a con- scious decision not to process certain types of information. For example, a busy supervisor may let the phone ring without answering it so that she can finish her paperwork. Although this technique can work if the overload is temporary, it will be ineffective if an employee misses an important commu- nication.

Error. In the error type of response, the employee attempts to deal with every message she receives. But in so doing, each processed message includes reception error. The processing errors are not intentional but result from processing more than can be handled.

Perhaps a good example of this would be a student who has two hours in which to study four chapters for a test. A student using the error method would attempt to read and memorize all four chapters in two hours. Obviously, her test score will probably indicate that even though she did all of her reading, much of it was not remembered or not remembered correctly.

The probability of error occurring can be reduced in two ways. First, the message can be made redundant. That is, after communicating an important message over the telephone, it is a good idea to write a memo to the other person summarizing the major points of the conversation. Furthermore, after sending an important memo, it is wise to call its recipient to ensure that the memo was not only received but also read.

Second, error can be reduced by having the recipient verify the message. Ask the person to repeat the message or to acknowledge that she has read and understood it. For example, after a customer has placed an order at the drive-thru window of a fast-food restaurant, the employee repeats the order to the customer to make sure she heard it correctly. (Of course, with the poor- quality intercoms used by such places, most people still cannot understand the employee.)

Queuing. Another method of dealing with communication overload is queuing— placing the work into a queue, or waiting line. The order of the queue can be based on such variables as the message’s importance, timeliness, or sender. For example, a memo sent by the company president will probably be placed near or

at the beginning of the queue, as will an emergency phone message. On the other hand, a message to return the phone call of a salesperson most likely will go at the end of the queue.

With this method of handling communication overload, all of the work will usually get done. However, queues are effective only if the communication over- load is temporary. If the employee is constantly overloaded, she will never reach the messages at the end of the queue.

Escape. If communication overload is prolonged, a common employee response is to escape, usually through absenteeism and ultimately through resignation. This response certainly is not beneficial to an organization, but it can be beneficial to an employee if it protects her mental and physical health by relieving stress.

An example of the escape response is often seen with students who withdraw from college courses. A student may enroll in six classes and realize after two months that she does not have enough time to do all of the reading and writ- ing required for six classes. Rather than choosing the error or omission strategy, either of which would result in lower grades, the student withdraws from one of her classes to reduce her overload.

Use of a Gatekeeper. A response to communication overload used by many execu- tives is the use of a gatekeeper, a person who screens potential communication and allows only the most important to go through. Receptionists and secretaries are the most obvious examples of gatekeepers.

Use of Multiple Channels. The final coping response to communication overload is the use of multiple channels. With this strategy, an organization reduces the amount of communication going to one person by directing some of it to another. For example, in a small restaurant, all of the problems involving cus- tomers, employees, finances, and vendors are handled by the owner. But as the business grows, the owner may not be able to handle all of the communication and thus may hire others to deal with finances (a bookkeeper) and vendors (an assistant manager).

Knowing and understanding this list of responses to communication overload is important. When communication overload occurs, employees will react in ways that reduce the increased stress. Some of these strategies (omission, error, escape) result in negative consequences for the organization. Thus, the organization must recognize when overload occurs and aggressively adopt an acceptable strategy to deal with it.
