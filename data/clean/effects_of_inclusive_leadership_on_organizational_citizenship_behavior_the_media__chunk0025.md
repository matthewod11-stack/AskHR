# Measures

We measured inclusive leadership behavior with the nine items developed by Carmeli et al. (2010). Sample items are “Themanager isreadytolistentomyrequests”,“Themanagerisavailableforpro- fessional questions I would like to consult with him/her about”, and“The manager is open to hearing new ideas”. The scale reliabil- ity reported by a previous study (Carmeli et al., 2010) showed a Cronbach’s alpha of .94. Carmeli et al. (2010) found that the scale correlated positively with employee psychological safety and employee involvement in creative work. The scale’s alpha reliabil- ity in this study is .906 and is consistent with other previous research (Choi et al., 2017).

Eleven items adapted from Rahim, Magner Antonioni, and Rahman (2001) were used to measure organizational justice. Sample items are “The rewards I receive from my organization are in accordance with my level of performance” and “I believe that my rewards accurately reflect my contributions to the organiza- tion”. The reliability of that study was reported as adequate, with Cronbach’s alpha of .85 for U.S. managers (Rahim et al., 2001). Rahim et al. found that organizational justice has positive correla- tions with organizational commitment. The scale’s alpha reliability in this study is .951.

Seven items adapted from the shortened version of the dimen- sions of the learning organization questionnaire by Yang et al. (2004) were employed to measure organizational learning culture. The seven items represent each of the seven dimensions of organi- zational learning culture: continuous learning, inquiry and dialog, team learning, empowerment, embedded system, system connec- tion, and strategic leadership. Prior studies have used this scale and reported adequate reliability (Islam et al., 2012; Joo, 2010; Joo & Shim, 2010). Sample items are “In my organization, people help each other learn” and “My organization encourages people to
