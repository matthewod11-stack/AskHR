# 52 PERSONALITY AND WORK

provides stronger evidence for the theories and prevents misinter- pretation of the evidence. As studies of absenteeism and health have shown, happy workers may be more likely than unhappy workers to miss work due to illness but more likely than unhappy workers to miss work due to injuries or the desire to do something more fun. Therefore, studies that examine absenteeism without study- ing the reasons for it may not provide useful evidence about the processes underlying the happiness-absenteeism relation. Research- ers who specify the precise mechanisms underlying the happy worker hypothesis in a speciﬁc context will be able to provide a stronger test of their theory.

The importance of the happy worker hypothesis may be in- creasing as the nature of work changes. Howard (1995) noted that as we have moved into a postindustrial information age, the focus of work has shifted from making products to managing and pro- viding information. This shifting focus has resulted in increased numbers of service jobs, greater reliance on teamwork and the sharing of information, and higher involvement by workers. Many industries change quickly, and successful organizations adapt and provide novel products, services, and processes. These changes are transforming the nature of work in ways that have the potential to increase the inﬂuence of happiness and well-being on worker pro- ductivity. Therefore, the resurgence of interest in the happy worker hypothesis may be well timed to deal with the changing nature of work in the postindustrial information age.
