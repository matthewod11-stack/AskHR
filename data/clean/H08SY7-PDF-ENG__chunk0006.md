## Through years of my own behavioral science research and independent

coaching of senior leaders, I’ve come to see that while most leadership

advice centers on being data-driven, the world’s top-performing CEOs

often rely on something else entirely: intuition. And the most eﬀective

ones treat it not as a superpower they’re born with, but a skill they’ve

worked to sharpen.
