# to higher resistance.

Such understanding brings about the need to identify the implications in

resistance to change of what could be identified as dialogic or monologic participation,

and such a line of investigation would contribute to that line of research that explores

the communicative nature of influences on change. Thus, it would be simultaneously

strongly coherent with the logic underpinning a participatory approach (Russ, 2008) to

constructivist ontology. Besides, as other scholars have already alerted, for practitioners

to be able to make good use of advice on involving employees when dealing with

resistance to change, they need to know how employees react to the different nature

through which such participation can be promoted (Seibold and Shea, 2001; Lewis,

2006).This study is one step towards closing this gap in current research.
