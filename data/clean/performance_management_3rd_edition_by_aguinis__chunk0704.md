# 5.1.3 Determining Performance Standards

After accountabilities and objectives have been determined, the next step is to define performance standards. These are yardsticks designed to help people understand to what extent the objective has been achieved. The standards provide raters with information about what to look for to determine the level of perform- ance that has been achieved. Standards can refer to various aspects of a specific objective, including quality, quantity, and time. Each of these aspects can be consid- ered a criterion to be used in judging the extent to which an objective has been achieved.

- Quality: how well the objective has been achieved? This can include use- fulness, responsiveness, effect obtained (e.g., problem resolution), acceptance rate, error rate, and feedback from users or customers (e.g., customer com- plaints, returns).

- Quantity: how much has been produced, how many, how often, and at what cost? • Time: due dates, adherence to schedule, cycle times, deadlines (how quickly?) (e.g., timetables, progress reports)?

Standards must include an action, the desired result, a due date, and some type of quality or quantity indicator. For example, a standard might be the following: Reduce overtime from 150 hours/month to 50 hours/month by December 1, 2012, at a cost not to exceed $12,000. The action is reduce, the due date is December 1, 2012, and the indicators are the reduction in hours from 150 to 50 and at a cost not to exceed $12,000.

Standards usually describe fully satisfactory performance. As soon as a standard has been created, one can create standards that describe minimum performance and outstanding performance. For example, the minimum standard could be the following: Reduce overtime from 150 hours/month to 75 hours/month by December 1, 2012, at a cost not to exceed $12,000. The standard suggesting outstanding performance could be the follow- ing: Reduce overtime from 150 hours/month to 40 hours/month by October 1, 2012, at a cost not to exceed $12,000.

In writing standards, consider the following characteristics that often determine

whether one has a useful standard:

- 1. Related to the position. Good standards are based on the job’s key elements and tasks, not on individual traits or person-to-person comparisons.

- 2. Concrete, specific, and measurable. Good standards are observable and verifiable. They allow us to distinguish between different performance levels. A good standard allows supervisors to measure the employee’s actual performance to determine if it is below expectations, fully satisfactory, or above expectations. Standards are specific and concrete so that there should be no dispute over whether and how well they were met.

- 3. Practical to measure. Good standards provide necessary information about performance in the most efficient way possible. Good standards are created by taking into account the cost, accuracy, and availability of the needed data.

- 4. Meaningful. Good standards are about what is important and relevant to the purpose of the job, to the achievement of the organization’s mission and objectives, and to the user or recipient of the product or service.
