Employees must have the skills and abilities to complete the training successfully. For example, if an employee is not bright enough to learn a computer program or doesn’t have the dexterity to perform intricate microelectronics assembly, no amount of training will improve his performance. There should be minimal outside factors (e.g., work or family problems) that might distract the employee and keep him from concentrating on the training program. Employees must be motivated to learn. That is, they must perceive that training is needed, that the training program meets their expectations, that they have the ability to complete the training (self-efficacy), and that there will be some reward (e.g., pay, career advancement) for performing well.
