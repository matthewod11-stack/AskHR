## 3.(cid:32) Confidentiality and Medical Information:

The ADA restricts the nature of the medical questions that may be asked and imposes absolute privacy on the medical data obtained either in the hiring process or while the employment endures. The employers can only ask for such information when it is required by their job and is for the business. A breach of these obligations may even lead to legal liability, reputation loss, and the interruption of the operations within the organization. However, most employers (mostly in under-resourced or rural settings) do not comply with or are not aware of these duties, and the emphasis on regular enforcement and education of the full responsibilities should be stressed.
