People Analytics (PA) establishes itself as the critical foundation for iterative strategic

decision-making processes within HR. It provides a framework for leveraging the various

utilization of data-driven Human Resource Management (HRM), encompassing data, metrics,

and analytics, across all stages of the decision-making cycle. This integrated approach ensures

that the value of these elements lies not in their standalone existence, but rather in their

application (Fitz-enz, 2010). Consequently, the selection of appropriate metrics and analytical

tools becomes crucial. Tailoring these elements to the specific context of the decision at hand

is essential for maximizing their effectiveness.

In the pursuit of maturity within PA, there are suggestions that consistency throughout the

analytical process is paramount. Maintaining standardized procedures for data collection,

analysis, and evaluation across various projects and time frames is essential. Evaluation post-

analysis emerges as a crucial component of maturity levels. By systematically assessing the

effectiveness and impact of each analysis, organizations can gauge whether the insights gleaned

are aligned with initial objectives and if they translate into actionable outcomes. This iterative

evaluation process serves as a foundation for continuous improvement within analytical

endeavors. Another pivotal aspect contributing to maturity lies in the selection of appropriate

data collection method and tailor data collection approaches to the specific research questions.

Whether drawing from structured quantitative data sources or tapping into unstructured

qualitative data, the focus should always be on data relevance, accuracy, and reliability and

legal, ethical aspects. Equally significant is the consideration of methodology. The choice of

analytical approach should align closely with the objectives of the analysis and the nature of
