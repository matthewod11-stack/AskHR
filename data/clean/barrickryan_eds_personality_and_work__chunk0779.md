# 264 PERSONALITY AND WORK

this broad array, Kristof (1996) noted that the most frequent op- erationalization of PO ﬁt in research has been values congruence, or the match between the values of the individual and the organi- zation (Bretz et al., 1993; Cable & Judge, 1996; Cable & Parsons, 2001; Chatman, 1991; Judge & Cable, 1997; Meglino, Ravlin, & Ad- kins, 1989; O’Reilly & Chatman, 1986; O’Reilly, Chatman, & Cald- well, 1991; Posner, Kouzes, & Schmidt, 1985; Schneider, Goldstein, & Smith, 1995).

In a follow-up investigation, Kristof-Brown (2000) asked re- cruiters to identify speciﬁc characteristics they used to assess PO ﬁt in a set of common job applicants and had independent coders categorize these characteristics as (1) knowledge, skills, and abili- ties, (2) personality traits, (3) values, or (4) other things. Results indicated that 100 percent of the recruiters mentioned at least one personality trait as indicative of PO ﬁt, whereas only 65 percent mentioned values. These results suggest that personality represents an important but understudied component of PO ﬁt.

Our purpose is not to suggest that personality-based ﬁt is more important than values-based ﬁt, or vice versa. Instead, we hope to clarify the conditions in which each basis of ﬁt is likely to maximize prediction of individual and organizational outcomes. To address this issue, it is necessary to clarify the relation of personality and values. This is not an easy task, as the terms have sometimes been used interchangeably. For example, Campbell (1963) included val- ues and personality, along with habits, attitudes, and beliefs, in a list of acquired behavioral dispositions. Furthermore, studies com- paring the two often ﬁnd support for strong, positive relationships between particular personality traits and speciﬁc values. For ex- ample, people high on the Five-Factor Model (FFM) trait of open- ness to experience have been found to consistently hold the values of a “world of beauty” and being “broadminded” and “imaginative” (Dollinger, Leong, & Ulicni, 1996). Extraverts have been found to value comfort and excitement, and people high on neuroticism to value independence and freedom from conﬂict (Furnham, 1984). Judge and Cable (1997) found that FFM traits predicted organi- zational culture preferences or values, although they noted that the relations between the two were small.

Despite incidences of corresponding values and personality traits, examining the deﬁnitions of these two sets of constructs care-
