# Written Communication Skills

Attempts to improve the quality of written communication have generally taken two paths. One approach concentrates on improving the writer’s skills, and the other concentrates on making material easier to read.

Improving Writing With increased use of email, effective writing skills are more essential than ever (Tyler, b). It is difficult for an organization to overcome an employ- ee’s lack of formal training in writing (or to change bad writing habits). Several consulting firms, however, specialize in the improvement of employee writing by teaching employees the most important concepts of writing. For example, Broadbent () advises that writing can be improved when writers value what they write, set personal standards and goals (e.g., vocabulary usage at a twelfth- grade reading level, no grammar errors, each document proofread twice), and spend considerable time doing their own editing as well as getting others to edit the document. Employees need to analyze their audience: If a written communication is intended for a blue-collar employee, then the readability must be kept simple. If the intended audience is a busy executive, the message must be kept short.

Readability Written communication can break down when material is too difficult for many employees to read. Here are some examples:

Federal Aviation Administration regulations and many airline-company pilots’ association agreements are too difficult for pilots to read (Blumenfeld, ). Corporate annual reports are too difficult for most adults to understand (Courtis, ). The Position Analysis Questionnaire (the job analysis instrument discussed in Chapter ) is also too difficult for most job incumbents to read (Ash & Edgell, ).

Thus, providing employees with important material to read will be an effec- tive communication form only if the employees can understand what is written. In a study of written communication at a restaurant chain, Smith and Christensen () found a wide range of readability levels in written materials given to employees. Though most communication was written at a ninth-grade level, a memo to cooks was written at the fourth-grade level and the sexual harassment policy was written at a level such that an associate’s degree (fifteenth grade) would be needed to understand the writing. Given that most of the employees had only a high-school education, many probably did not understand the sexual harassment policy.

To solve the problem of complex reading levels in documents written by Washington state employees, in  Governor Chris Gregoire initiated a “plain talk” policy requiring that documents be written at a level that could be under- stood by the general public.

To ensure that employees will be able to understand written material, several readability indices are available. When using such an index, an organization ana- lyzes the material to be read and then compares its readability level with the typi- cal education of the employees who will read the document. For example, if most employees have high school diplomas but have not been to college, the document should be written at less than a twelfth-grade level.

Each index uses a slightly different formula or method. For example, the Fry Readability Graph (Fry, ) uses the average number of syllables per word and the average length of sentences to determine readability (Figure .).
