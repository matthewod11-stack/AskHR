## HBR / Digital Article / How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management

ADI IGNATIUS:

Some of these founders, entrepreneurs who got into whatever they

got into because they wanted to make the world a better place, Serge

and Larry in their garage trying to systematize our access to all the

world’s information, these great ideals: when they are actually running

companies, they not only are trying to run a company, but they become

killers, wanting to wipe out the competition, to foster monopolistic

practices, to just grab as much market share as possible.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

Is any of this new? Within the businesses? No, I’m serious. Were the

businesses of previous eras cuddly? Did they want their competitors to

succeed? Were they trying to rise all boats?

Capitalism is an inherently competitive process. These companies are

very, very good performers. If you want to use the adjective “killer” for

them, I think that’s by design. You’re not in business not to succeed. You

want to grow your market share. You want to grow your proﬁts, you want

grow. That is often at the expense of somebody else.

I think it’s for the courts to decide whether they meet the deﬁnition

of monopolist. It’s a word we toss around a lot. The courts so far have

tossed out a lot of the recent lawsuits against some of these giant tech

companies. I don’t think they meet the deﬁnition of monopolist. In

general, for a lot of these companies, the competition is one click away.

And is Tesla a monopolist in the auto industry? You simply can’t make

that case. SpaceX has become pretty close to a monopolist in the rockets

and satellites industry, but they didn’t start that way, and they’ve

become so large and inﬂuential because they do the job better.
