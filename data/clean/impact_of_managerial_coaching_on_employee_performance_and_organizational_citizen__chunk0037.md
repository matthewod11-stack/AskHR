# 3.4 Analysis Strategy

SPSS (version 22) was used for statistical analysis. The descriptive analysis described the mean, standard deviation, and correlation matrix. For evaluation of the measurement model, reliability via Cronbachâ€™s alpha, convergent validity using average variance extracted (AVE) and discriminant validity based on Fornell-Larcker criterion were ensured. Cohen and Cohen (1983) technique of hierarchical regression analyses was used to observe the direct relationships of managerial coaching and employee outcomes. Baron and Kenny (1986) technique were used to observe indirect relationships. This technique is mostly used in psychological literature; therefore, this technique is used in this study (Preacher & Hayes, 2014). For measuring the significance of mediation effect, sobel test was used (Sobel, 1982, 1986). This technique is enhancement of Baron and Kenny method for checking significance of mediation effect, therefore this technique is used (Kraemer et al., 2008).
