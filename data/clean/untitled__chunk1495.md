# Sex Differences and Similarities

In the decades preceding the second wave of feminism, psy- chologists had assumed profound differences between men and women in cognitive capacities, emotions, personality traits, values, and inclinations. These presumptions furnished support for the norm of male superiority and justiﬁed a range of inequities between men and women. Thus, one of the ﬁrst projects of feminists in psychology was a program of correc- tive research, aimed at reexamining purported differences be- tween men and women. In 1974, Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin published a review of sex-difference research in psy- chology that soon became a classic. Surveying over 1,400 studies covering more than 80 psychological traits and skills, they found reliable evidence for sex differences in only four areas. Indeed, many of the studies were so ﬂawed that noth- ing could be concluded from them.

Studies of the psychological differences and similarities between men and women still continue. However, a number of important methodological and conceptual advances have been made. Feminist researchers have pointed out repeatedly that a sex-difference ﬁnding does not signify a difference that is inherent or biologically determined. A great deal of femi- nist research has examined the power of roles, norms, and expectations to inﬂuence behavior, as well as the penalties in- curred for role violations. Indeed, the correlational design of most sex-difference studies makes it impossible to draw any conclusions about causality. Another signiﬁcant advance is the adaptation of meta-analysis for use in investigations of sex differences (Hyde & Linn, 1988). Like a narrative review of the literature, meta-analysis collates the results of selected studies into a single integrated summary. Meta-analysis, however, cumulates the results statistically. Meta-analysis also calculates the size of a gender difference (Johnson & Eagly, 2000).

Feminist psychologists challenged psychology’s con- ception and measurement of masculinity and femininity. Anne Constantinople (1973) pointed out that standard
