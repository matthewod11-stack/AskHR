# Winning by Stopping

What these practices have in common is not better tools, but a mindset

shift. Stopping projects isn’t about cutting headcount or shrinking the

organization—it’s about sharpening focus and amplifying impact.

When organizations streamline their projects, transformation

accelerates, strategies are achieved faster, and people are more

motivated and productive. Energy ﬂows to the work that truly matters,

and success becomes more visible and contagious. It leads people to feel

prouder to be working for your organization.

At your next portfolio meeting, resist the instinct to ask, “What should

we start next?” Ask instead: “If we could only do half of what we’re doing

now, which half would we keep?” And then act on that answer. Because

in the project economy, winning doesn’t come from starting more—it

comes from stopping what no longer matters and relentlessly focusing

on what does matter.
