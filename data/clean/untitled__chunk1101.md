## Promoting the Study of Individual Lives: Gordon Allport and Henry Murray 187

status. But he noted that even a general law could be one that explained “how uniqueness comes about”; for example, the principle of functional autonomy, which suggests that mo- tivesbecomeindependentoftheiroriginsin“infantile”or“ar- chaic” drives (p. 194; emphasis in original), accounts for unique personal motives. Allport also pointed out psycholo- gists’ neglect of laws that applied to particular individuals: “Thecourseofeachlifeisalawfulevent,eventhoughitisun- like all others of its class” (p. 558). The study of individual lives, he suggested, would enable psychologists to make bet- ter predictions of individual behavior, one of the goals of sci- entiﬁc psychology.

Allport saw the case study as the psychologist’s “ﬁnal afﬁrmation of the individuality and uniqueness of every per- sonality” (G. W. Allport, 1937b, p. 390). Clinicians and soci- ologists, he argued, had developed the method with a focus on “maladjustments” or on “social inﬂuences surrounding the individual” (p. 390) rather than on personality itself. Focus- ing within the person, he chose to overlook “the factors shap- ing personality” (p. viii; emphasis in original). This neglect of cultural and social contexts reﬂected the emerging person- ality ideal (Nicholson, 1998, in press) and the psychological Zeitgeist (for example, Allport’s text was more successful than that of Stagner, 1937, who emphasized social and cultural factors; see Barenbaum, 2000). Ironically, however, it may have resulted in case studies that were one-sided (see our discussion of context later in the chapter).
