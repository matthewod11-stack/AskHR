# 248 PERSONALITY AND WORK

level of performance-avoidance orientation as opposed to those with low levels of performance avoidance.

These types of studies show that ATIs can be important for un- derstanding motivational and learning outcomes. We contend that the next logical step is to begin to examine when ATIs are impor- tant enough to have practical signiﬁcance. Figures 9.3 and 9.4 qual- ify the conditions when designing training interventions tailored to ATIs might be useful and when doing so might be less so. The gray boxes reﬂect the range of scores on pre- and posttraining measures, and the white dots reﬂect particular individuals’ scores. Figure 9.3 exempliﬁes the strong situation where training is very effective for all involved. This may happen frequently when the training out- come is somewhat narrow, for instance, some sort of knowledge ac- quisition in a domain relatively unknown prior to training (training computer programmers to learn a procedure in a particular com- puter programming language). Here, despite possible individual differences in preference for the structure of training, trainee anx- iety, and so on, all who were trained achieved mastery.

Figure 9.4 is perhaps a more interesting example, combining possible ATIs shown in scores on pretraining and posttraining mea- sures. The rank order of individuals on scores differs from pre- training to posttraining measures (that is, some ATIs are present). The point here is that the mastery level established on the train- ing outcome informs the extent that designing training to ATIs matters. An extreme case is where any increase on the learning outcome, no matter how slight, is valuable to the organization. In
