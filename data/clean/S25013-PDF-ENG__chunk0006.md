Unfortunately, most people are pessimistic about how it will shape

the future. Seventy-seven percent of Americans are concerned that its

adoption will cause job losses within the next 12 months, according to

research by Forbes Advisor. Eighty percent think AI has increased the

likelihood that their personal data will be used in malicious ways by

criminals. And it gets worse: A poll conducted by YouGov found that

nearly half of Americans believe that one day AI will attack humanity.

With this much cynicism about AI, getting workers to willingly, eagerly,

and thoroughly experiment with it is a daunting task.

In conducting more than a decade of research on adoption of the

technology, including in-depth qualitative interviews and experiments

with some 2,500 users, I have uncovered whatâ€™s driving this

resistance to AI: fundamental human perceptions that AI is too

opaque, emotionless, rigid, and independent, and that interacting

with humans is far more preferable. Understanding those drivers is

critical to designing interventions that will increase AI adoption inside

organizations and among consumers generally. In this article I will

delve into them in detail and explain what you can do as a manager

to counter them.
