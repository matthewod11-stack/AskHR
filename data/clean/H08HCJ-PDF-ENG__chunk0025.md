# HBR / Digital Article / Research: The Risks of Founding a Startup Near Big Companies

Startups looking to grow may very well ﬁnd the talent they need by

locating in talent-rich communities. Our research ﬁnds, however, that

there are signiﬁcant drawbacks to locating near large ﬁrms, as their

hiring patterns can have a stiﬂing impact on startups’ ability to scale.

When startups must compete for talent by paying higher salaries, it can

deplete limited ﬁnancial resources, making growth in other areas more diﬃcult. Incorporating our ﬁndings into any landscape analysis — and

seeking new avenues to ﬁnd employees — may help startups navigate

the talent wars to grow successfully.
