received the training are collectively called the experimental group, and the employees who did not receive the training are collectively called the control group.

Suppose we were interested in finding out whether wearing a suit to an inter- view is better for men than wearing a coat and slacks. We could study this issue by observing job applicants at a specific company and comparing the interview scores of people with suits with those of people wearing coats and slacks. We might find that the better-dressed applicants received higher scores, but we could not conclude that wearing a suit caused the higher scores; something other than the suit may be at work. Perhaps applicants who own suits are more socially skilled than other applicants; it then might have been social skill and not dress style that led to the higher interview scores.

If we want to determine that dress style affects interview scores, we have to manipulate the variable of interest and hold all other variables as constant as possible. How could we turn this into an experiment? Let us take  people and randomly assign  of them to wear suits and assign the other  to wear sport coats and slacks. Each subject then goes through an interview with an HR director. Afterward, we compare the interview scores of our two groups. In this case, the independent variable is the type of dress and the dependent variable is the interview score.

Even though this particular research design is not very sophisticated and has some problems (see if you can spot them), the fact that we manipulated the applicant’s dress style gives us greater confidence that dress style was the cause of higher interview scores. Even though the results of experiments provide more confidence regarding cause-and-effect relationships, ethical and practical considerations do not always make experimental designs possible.

Suppose we wish to study the effect of loud noise on worker performance. To make this an experimental design, we could have  subjects work on an assembly line while being subjected to very loud noise and  subjects work on an assembly line with no noise. Two months later, we compare the productivity of the two groups. But what is wrong with this study? In addition to having lower productivity, the high-noise group now has poorer hearing—not a very ethical- sounding experiment (yes, the pun was intended).

Quasi-experiments. Even though researchers prefer to use experiments, it is not always possible. Quasi-experiments are then used. As an example, let’s go back to our noise study. Because we cannot manipulate the level of noise, we will instead test the noise level of  manufacturing plants and compare the average productivity of plants with lower noise levels with that of plants with higher noise levels. As you can easily see, this is not as good a research design as the unethical experiment that we created earlier. There are too many variables other than noise that could account for any differences found in productivity; however, given the circumstances, it still provides us with more information than we had before the study.

Quasi-experiments are often used to evaluate the results of a new program implemented by an organization. For example, an organization that had instituted a child-care center wanted to see whether the center had any effect on employee absenteeism. To find the answer, the organization compared absenteeism levels from the year before the center was introduced with the absenteeism levels for the year following the implementation; the organization found that both absen- teeism and turnover had decreased.

Although it is tempting to conclude that the child-care center was a success, such a conclusion would not be prudent. Many other variables might have caused the reduction. As shown in Table ., the organization implemented several other progressive programs during the same period. Thus, the decrease in absenteeism and turnover could have been the result of other programs or some combination of programs. Furthermore, the economy changed and jobs became more difficult
