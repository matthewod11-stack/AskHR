# diﬀerent support or a new challenge?

A high-trust, high-performance team doesn’t have to start from scratch.

It can be built from the pieces you inherit—if you take the time to

understand them.

. . .

The mark of a great leader is not how quickly they act, but how

wisely they decide. When you inherit a team, you’re not just managing

headcount; you’re shaping or reshaping culture. How you show up in

those early days sets the tone for your leadership brand. Do you lead

with empathy and insight, or ego and impulse?

The best leaders lead with both urgency and patience. They make

decisive moves, but only after gathering the right information. They

bring fresh vision, but also honor the work that came before them.

And they recognize that performance, trust, and culture are intertwined

with each one shaping the others. Lead with a vision and the same

thoughtfulness you hope to inspire in them.
