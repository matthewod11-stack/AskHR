# Role prompting

Role prompting is a technique in prompt engineering that involves assigning a speci(cid:450)c role to

the gen AI model. This can help the model to generate more relevant and informative output,

as the model can cra(cid:454) its responses to the speci(cid:450)c role that it has been assigned.

For example, you could role prompt a gen AI model to be a book editor, a kinderga(cid:457)en

teacher, or a motivational speaker. Once the model has been assigned a role, you can then

give it prompts that are speci(cid:450)c to that role. For example, you could prompt a teacher to

create a lesson plan that they can then review. Have a look into Table 5, where the model

takes the role of a travel guide.
