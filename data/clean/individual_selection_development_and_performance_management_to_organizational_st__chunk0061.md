## Level Two: Developing Competency Models for Occupational Groups

Using competency models based on an oc- cupational group can help streamline HR ini- tiatives, which will reduce resource needs, as well as provide a larger snapshot of groups of jobs. The groups of jobs can be based on empirical data or strategic needs. In both cases, the common competencies for a group

of jobs are identified and the resulting com- petency model is used.

Assessment. OPM developed job clusters (see Table IV) to provide the foundation for a new selection test for federal clerical occupations. Four clusters of clerical occupations were identified, with a set of core competencies identified for all clerical occupations. For each of the four clusters or families of jobs (e.g., administrative), additional cluster-specific core competencies were identified. The cleri- cal examination measures both core and cluster-specific competencies. The clerical test is in modular form so that different sections of the test can be used for appropriate job fami- lies (e.g., Arithmetic/Mathematical Reasoning for jobs in the Financial Family; see Table IV).

Career banding. OPMâ€™s job families have been used as a foundation for occupational consoli- dation and career banding. For each job fam- ily, career bands can be defined. Career bands are broad levels (e.g., entry, intermediate, full, and expert) for which required competencies are identified. This grouping is similar to the banding of pay grades in broadbanding, but is not designed to modify pay grades. By devel- oping families and bands of jobs that are based on common competencies, employers are able to fully utilize their resources by developing and implementing training programs that re- flect these competencies. Employees, in turn, can begin to understand the competencies required for progression in their current jobs and become aware of other career alternatives.

Succession planning. Another empirically based application of a competency model for an occupational group was the development of a leadership succession model that provided the critical competencies for supervisors, man- agers, and executives. This succession plan- ning model identified the competencies tar- geted for training by the Federal Management Development Centers. Training course de- scriptions are linked to these competencies. The leadership competency model for execu- tives was updated in 1998 (Eyde, Gregory, Muldrow, & Mergen, 1999) using an exten- sive literature review, benchmarking study with the private sector, and executive focus groups.

By developing families and bands of jobs that are based on common competencies, employers are able to fully utilize their resources by developing and implementing training programs that reflect these competencies.
