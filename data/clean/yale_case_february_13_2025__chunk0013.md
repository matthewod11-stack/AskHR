# 7 EXPLORING EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS IN SEARCH FUND–ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

mistakes, such as overlooking key details or mishandling the conversation. Proper preparation, including rehearsing the discussion, using detailed checklists, and ensuring the presence of a second person to observe and document, helps mitigate these risks. Partnering with a Professional Employment Organization (PEO)20 can also provide guidance and structure, ensuring the process is handled professionally and consistently. We will now enumerate a handful of termination steps that are best practices.

01 Reviewing the employee handbook and company policies

One of the first and most essential steps in this process is revisiting the employee handbook. It might seem mundane, but this document often carries more weight than we realize. Courts have treated employee handbooks as quasi-contracts in some cases, meaning the words on those pages could bind the company to specific procedures.21 If the handbook outlines steps like issuing written warnings or implementing a PIP before termination, skipping them could lead to significant legal risk. More importantly, it would cause the company to fail the fairness test—something every leader should prioritize.

Then there is the question of documentation. If a CEO has been honest with themselves, they have likely seen the signs of trouble long before arriving at the brink of termination. Have they communicated those concerns? Given formal warnings? Perhaps even put the employee on a PIP?22 A PIP, while dreaded by many, is not just a bureaucratic box to tick—it is an opportunity. It says, “We see potential here, but things have to change.” It gives the employee clarity, a timeline, and support to succeed. And for a leader, it builds a record that says, “We tried.”

The handbook is also a tool for consistency. Every organization develops a rhythm for how it handles performance issues and terminations, and the handbook reflects that rhythm. Reviewing it ensures the company is not making exceptions or setting precedents that could come back to haunt it later. Employees notice when policies are unevenly applied, and nothing erodes trust faster than inconsistency.

But this is not just about legality or optics—it is about doing what is right. Employee handbooks often house guidelines that protect employees against discrimination and provide paths for them to voice grievances. By adhering to these guidelines, the CEO signals that the organization values fairness and transparency. It is not just about avoiding lawsuits; it is about treating people with dignity.

Paperwork and plans, however, are only half the equation. There is a human side to this process that cannot be ignored. Open discussions are where it often begins—not a tense, one-sided critique, but a genuine conversation. “Here’s what I’m seeing. How do you see it?” These moments, though sometimes uncomfortable, allow for a mutual understanding to emerge. Sometimes, the employee doesn’t even realize the gravity of their underperformance. Other times, they will share struggles the firm could not have known about—personal issues, unclear expectations, or even feelings of being set up to fail. These talks can shift the trajectory entirely or reinforce that a change must occur.23

As the CEO or manager follows these steps, they should take a moment to reflect. What message is the organization sending to the rest of the team? If people know the process was thorough and transparent, they will trust that decisions in the enterprise are fair. They will see that the CEO has taken every measure to address issues before making the hard call. This matters—not just for morale but also for the culture most ETA CEOs are trying to build.
