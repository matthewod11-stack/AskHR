## Figure 13.2 Traditional vs. team approaches

that teams differ on two major characteristics: temporal duration (ad hoc versus ongoing) and product type (project versus production). For this chapter, teams will be classified into the four categories determined by Cohen and Bailey (): work teams, parallel teams, project teams, and management teams.

Work Teams Work teams consist of groups of employees who manage themselves, assign jobs, plan and schedule work, make work-related decisions, and solve work- related problems (Kirkman & Shapiro, ). They are typically formed to produce goods, provide service, or increase the quality and cost-effectiveness of a product or system. For example, work teams at:

As shown in Figure ., the traditional method of manufacturing a product is to have employees specialize in performing one particular task. For example, a company might have a supervisor, sorter, assembler, solderer, and quality inspec- tor. The sorter places parts on the assembly line, the assembler puts the parts together, the solderer solders the parts, and the quality control inspector makes sure the part is properly assembled.

In a team approach, there would be no supervisor. Each of the production workers would be called a “team member” and be cross-trained to perform all of the tasks. In this way, if parts were assembled faster than they could be soldered, the sorter might spend some time soldering rather than sorting or waiting. The team would be responsible for checking its own quality, and one of the production workers would probably be appointed as a team leader. The use of
