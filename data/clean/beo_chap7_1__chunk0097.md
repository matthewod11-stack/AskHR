# CHAPTER SEVEN

One study shows that it is better to have one manager creating code than to rotate

code-creation among the subjects (Rick et al. 2004). This suggests that having a

single “founder” creating code is better—specialization is better than taking the

best code ideas from different workers. However, the single-manager groups have a

harder time integrating new employees; the managers are more likely to give up on

teaching the new employee, who then makes a lot of costly picture-naming errors.

Two other studies explore how conflict is created when groups “merge.” Weber

and Camerer (2003) found that when two groups naming the same pictures merged

(like a horizontal merger of similar businesses), subjects were too optimistic about

how rapidly code could be created in the merged group. Feiler and Camerer (2006)

replicated this result with different groups of pictures (like a diversifying merger)

and where subjects were endogenously sorted into the merger group through bids

for wage premia to join the merged firm. Subjects’ guesses about the speed of
