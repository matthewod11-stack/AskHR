conducted to assess the department’s performance— efficiency, effectiveness, and client satisfaction—in relation to the vision and business plan. The steps in the process include the following:

- 1. Business plan goals and strategies. Identify the desired outcomes that the organization is seeking to achieve and outline how the goals will be realized.

- Performance goals and measures grow out of a depart- ment’s business plan.

- Employee performance measures align with those of the organization.

- The department, teams, and individuals are rewarded and recognized on the basis of these measures.

- 2. Human resources department plan. Outline the key strategies the department will undertake to address identified human resources (HR) issues to meet its business plan, within the context of the vision, values, government business plan, and the HR plan.

The organization’s team structure consists primarily of work or service teams, which align with the company’s departments. Because of the close relationship with local government entities, however, the organization also utilizes network teamsthat focus on government regulatory needs as they relate to public service providers and project teamsthat are assembled on an as-needed basis to work on various projects that come from the network teams.
