# What the Research Tells Us

For nearly a decade, we’ve studied how stretch assignments impact the

trajectories of early-career employees. While previous research focuses

on their importance at the mid- to senior-career level, we asked: When

do stretch assignments start to matter and who beneﬁts most from

them? To answer these questions, we designed two research projects

examining their impact on engineers in their ﬁrst few years on the job.

The ﬁrst was a qualitative study of 19 early-career professionals based

on two interview samples of recent graduates entering workforce.

Interviewees were predominantly women who reported being from

Asian, Black, Latina, or “other” racial/ethnic backgrounds, and were

asked to describe stretch assignments based on their own experiences.

They also reﬂected on how people were selected for these opportunities

and the outcomes of receiving them.

The second was a longitudinal, survey-based, quantitative study of
