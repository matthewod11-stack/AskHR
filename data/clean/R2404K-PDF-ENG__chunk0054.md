## INTERNAL INNOVATION (Example: corporate R&D units)

Avoided: Failing to produce is considered safer than producing a failure.

Avoided: R&D costs eat into EBITDA and therefore earnings per share.

Limited: Fixation on short-term profitability drowns out long-term innovation strategy.

Stifling: Innovation efforts are often killed by other priorities, bureaucracy, shortsightedness, political maneuvering, and the desire to maintain the status quo.

Squandered by bureaucracy: Best creative talent tends to avoid large bureaucratic firms.
