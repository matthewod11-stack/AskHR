# HBR / Digital Article / Expecting a Bad Performance Review? Here’s How to Prepare.

Demonstrate that you care about doing better

According to Barnard-Bahn, “showing that you care” is a top reason

separating employees are retained after messing up. “Backbone

combined with humility are the qualities leaders look for in their direct

reports,” she says — you need the backbone to withstand the criticism

you’re likely to endure after a failure and the humility to admit you

made a mistake.

At the end of the day, it’s important to look at the big

picture. Sometimes lagging performance isn’t a result of a blind spot

but an indication that you’re in the wrong position. If you still receive

a negative review despite your best efforts to be proactive, it may help

you realize that your skills, strengths, and interests don’t align with the

needs of your current role. Use the setback as a springboard for change

— and take this chance to re-evaluate your career.
