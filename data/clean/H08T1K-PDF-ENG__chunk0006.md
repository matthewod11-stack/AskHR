# What the Experts Say

As a senior leader, people look to you for clarity and reassurance. But

when the situation is uncertain, oﬀering that kind of steady conﬁdence

can feel like sugar coating, or worse, lying. Your team has questions.

And while they may not like the answers, they want and deserve

honesty, according to Courtney Lynch, founding partner of leadership

consulting ﬁrm Lead Star and coauthor of Spark, Bet on You, and

Leading from the Front. “Sometimes there’s a tendency to fall back on

phrases like, ‘We’re all in this together,’ or ‘Don’t worry, we’ll ﬁgure it

out.’ But what people need is clarity,” she says. “They’re not looking for

leaders to shine it up or play cheerleader.”

There is a place for positivity, however. Acknowledging uncertainty is

important, but don’t let your team get caught up in overanalyzing it,

says Darcy Eikenberg, executive coach and author of Red Cape Rescue.

Rather, “your goal is to get your team unstuck in the swirl of what-ifs

and help people focus on what they can control right now.” You don’t

need to be a Pollyanna “to magnify the positives and what’s working,”

she adds. Here’s how to strike the right balance.
