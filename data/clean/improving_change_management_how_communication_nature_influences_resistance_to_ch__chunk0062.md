# Change Context

Some months before the acquisition, Organization X was facing a very difficult

financial situation. Although extremely respected by its partners and customers, the

organization had accumulated a considerable dependence on bank money. Suppliers

were already concerned and the employees were in a climate of uncertainty every

month, wondering about being paid, being laid off or keeping the job longer. The rumors

prevailing on the market over the previous year were already about the possibility of

selling the company.

When the acquisition of Organization X byTheGroup was announced in April, 9th

of 2009, the main feeling wasof relief. Both the employees and the board were satisfied

with the perspectives that such a strong financial support, coming from a respected

pharmaceutical global group, would represent for the short and long terms.
