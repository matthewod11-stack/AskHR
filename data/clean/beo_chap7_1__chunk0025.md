labor supply elasticities that are negative (Camerer et al. 1997). Experienced drivers,

however, have zero elasticity, which suggests a role for learning or attrition over

time. Fehr and Gotte (2003) find similar results in a field experiment with bicycle

messengers. While randomly determined variation in monthly wages has a strong

positive effect on the number of shifts per month, it has a (weaker) negative effect on

the revenues within shift. Interestingly, the messengers for whom the nonstandard

negative revenue effect is strongest also exert sizable loss aversion in a laboratory
