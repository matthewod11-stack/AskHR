## something from these new measurements about choices.

Some basic facts about the brain can guide economic modeling (and already have, in “dual-process”

models). The brain is divided into four lobes—frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal. Regions of these lobes

are interconnected and create specialized “circuits” for performing various tasks.

The human brain is a primate brain with more neocortex. To deny this important fact is akin to

creationism. The fact that many human and anima brain structures are shared means that human behavior

generally involves interaction between “old” brain regions and more newly-evolved ones. The descent of

humans from other species also means we might learn something about human behavior from other species.

For example, rats become addicted to all drugs that humans become biologically addicted to, which implies that

old reward circuitry shared by rat and human brains is part of human addiction.

While we often think of complex behavior as deliberate, resources for “executive function” or

“cognitive control” are rather scarce (concentrated in the cingulate). As a result, the brain and body are very

good at delegating components of complex behavior into automatic processes. For example, a student driver is

overwhelmed by visual cues, verbal commands, memory required for navigation, and mastery of motor skills.

Many accidents result during this learning process. But within a few years, driving becomes so effortless that

drivers can eat and talk (perhaps on a cell phone) while driving safely.17

Methodologically, neuroeconomics is not intended to test economic theory in a traditional way

(particularly under the view that utilities and beliefs are only revealed by choices). Instead, the goal is to

establish the neural circuitry underlying economic decisions, for the eventual purpose of making better
