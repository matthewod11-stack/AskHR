## false dichotomy of merit and inclusion harms both individuals and

organizations. When cultures overemphasize merit without inclusion,

systemic barriers are ignored and privilege is mistaken for talent.

Conversely, tokenistic inclusion practices breed cynicism; when people

perceive inclusion as a lowering of standards, it delegitimizes the need

for true inclusionâ€”supporting everyone in maximizing their talent.
