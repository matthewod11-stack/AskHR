# Turn Breaks into Informal Social Time

Grab a bite to eat with colleagues over your lunch break. Your meeting

schedule may not allow a proper lunch break every day, but blocking out

at least a couple of days a week where you’re not multi-tasking at your

computer can make your lunch more enjoyable and more social. This

could be planned out in advance, where you meet up with someone in

another department who you don’t get to see often, or it could be more

informal with a team member who works right by you. If you’d like to

have a relaxed approach, simply ask someone if they want to join you

when you’re heading out the door or reheating your leftovers.
