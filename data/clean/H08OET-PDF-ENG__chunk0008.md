## HBR / Digital Article / How Costly Is a Resume Gap for Executives?

These ﬁndings sparked discussion on LinkedIn, so we decided to revisit

this topic. We asked more than 2,600 LinkedIn commenters: As an

employer, do you think a resume gap is relevant? Similar to our previous

ﬁndings, about two-thirds believed that resume gaps matter.

This time, we also asked if recency mattered. Among those contending

that gaps matter, more than half indicated that the negative signal

persists over time—that there is no expiration date on the impact of

gaps. This was consistent with our analysis of executives with resume

gaps who switched companies: We found the recency of the gap did not

measurably change the size of the negative ﬁnancial impact.

An analysis of the comments also pointed to some fresh angles:

If you’re going to have a resume gap, take control of the narrative.

In a previous HBR article, we discussed the compensation beneﬁts

of intentionally controlling our personal narratives. There is power in

owning your story and presenting your experience in a way that aligns

with the professional opportunities you’re seeking.

Our analysis indicates that for individuals with resume gaps, having

a richer digital professional proﬁle might help mitigate some of the

adverse impacts of a career gap. In our previous article on resume

gaps, we reported that job-switching executives without gaps received

an average 22% raise, but those with gaps only received 14% on

average. When we examined the digital professional proﬁles of the same

executives with resume gaps, we found those with stronger proﬁles

received an average 17% raise, while those with weaker proﬁles saw an
