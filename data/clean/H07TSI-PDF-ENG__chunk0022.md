# Rethink How Work Gets Done

“Place” is just another tool for getting work done. As HBS professor

Tsedal Neeley has observed, “I talk about using the oﬃce as a tool, the

same way we use various technologies as tools to communicate and

engage. If you see the oﬃce as a tool, you determine what speciﬁc uses

it has for collaborations that require people to be physically present

together.”

Yet 62% of our survey respondents told us that they do not have a say in

their work model policy. Instead, it is dictated either by company-wide

guidelines or by their manager. Of all participants, 39% reported that

their company decides where they work. In these companies, 24% of

employees were unhappy with their work location policy; this ﬁgure

decreases to 14% if the manager decides, and to 6% if the team decides.

The closer to the executors of the work the policy gets set, the more

satisﬁed employees are.
