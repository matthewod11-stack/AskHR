It’s not fair to deprive your team of information they need to grow.

When you reframe conﬂict as a healthy, normative part of leadership, it loosens the anticipatory anxiety you may feel broaching diﬃcult

topics with others. Next time you have to give feedback, take a deep

your people toward growth. You’re not criticizing; you’re nurturing. And

you’re certainly not being a villain; you’re being the leader they need.
