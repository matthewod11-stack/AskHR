(cid:1) The lack of development conversations was a major source of dissatisfaction which also correlated with intention to leave. The big conversation gap in relation to development was about career development rather than skills and training for the current job.

(cid:1) Issues related to work-life balance were not being well addressed.

(cid:1) Forty per cent of respondents had an issue about work which they wanted to

discuss but were not doing so. These respondents were nearly three times more likely than other respondents to be planning to leave the organisation in the next twelve months.

The study concluded that good dialogue rests on trust and can in turn lead to engagement and so improve performance. Conversations about performance which do not also address development for the future do not engage high performing employees. In other words ‘the best leaders are those who address performance and development together.’ (ibid.)

These studies suggest that semi-formal discussions may be helpful ie the conversation itself is planned, but its structure and agenda are not over- prescribed.

There is also a trend towards more people inputting into the end-of-year review to try to improve the quality of assessments. Surveys suggest that between a quarter and a third of employers are using some aspect of 360 degree appraisal, collecting input from colleagues and reports, and sometimes from customers. Some of this is formal moderated/managed ‘multi-rater’ feedback; in other cases it is informal comment. Finn (2007, cited in Wikina, 2008) states that a strong emphasis should be placed on regular and consistent feedback, especially informal feedback and research about 360 performance appraisal systems suggest that it is an effective way to increase the flow of information within an organisation (Garavan and Morley, 1997, cited in Sullip, 2010). The CIPD found that fewer than half of employees state that their line manager usually or always provides feedback on their performance, but those that could claim they always received feedback were more satisfied with their job (CIPD, 2009).

Within 360 feedback there is always a possible friendship bias but this can be reduced by training what colleagues need to evaluate (Reilly, Smither & Vasibopoulos, 1996, cited in Sillup, 2010). Evaluation of managers from their direct reports is seen as empowering for employees and to protect against retribution, ratings can be combined into overall ratings (Sillup, 2010) and employees given an opportunity to perform self appraisal are also found to be motivated and have
