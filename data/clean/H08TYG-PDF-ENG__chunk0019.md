# HBR / Digital Article / Q&A: Professor Robert Sutton on Communicating Difficult Decis…

We’ve talked a lot about layoﬀs. How does your framework apply to other diﬃcult business decisions?

I believe the framework is useful for helping leaders implement any

decision that might threaten their people’s job security, prestige, or pay.

Just last week, I was talking to the head of a new AI solutions group that

was doing work that overlapped with an older group in her company.

She told me that her CEO heard rumblings that the leader of the existing

group saw the new group as competitors, and the leader was worried

that his older group (including him) was now seen as less important,

would get less interesting work, and might be eliminated. The CEO met

with that stressed-out leader and emphasized how much he admired

and valued both him and his team’s work. He informed the leader that

he didn’t yet know what the new team’s charter would be, because it was

under development. But the CEO assured the leader he wouldn’t take

away any of the older team’s projects for at least two months (if it all).

And that even if the older team was eventually disbanded or merged

with the new team, no members of the team would be demoted, laid oﬀ, or get pay cuts. In the conversation, the CEO treated that troubled

leader with compassion and provided him and his team with a lot of

predictability. The assurances of employment stability also gave team

members objective and perceived control over their work and lives.

That’s a model for how to communicate in a time of uncertainty.
