## HBR / Magazine Article / Disability as a Source of Competitive Advantage

Interestingly, our results clearly indicated that people’s willingness to

pay was signiﬁcantly higher for a company that they liked and felt a

communal relationship with. So even though customers are not willing

to pay more for a product or a service just because the seller employs

people with disabilities—there is not a simple direct relationship—

they are willing to pay more for a product or service if they feel a

psychological bond with a company. And that bond is much more likely

to form if a ﬁrm is known to have disabled employees. Thus, there

is a strong indirect positive eﬀect on people’s willingness to pay for a

product or service. We also found some indication that customers would

be more likely to make repeat purchases from the company.
