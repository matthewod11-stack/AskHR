# Insert Table 5 about Here

Our second research question focused on exploring the relative importance of the

newer leadership theories. Thus, besides exploring the relative contribution of the newer

leadership styles with transformational and transactional leadership, we also conducted

relative weights analysis comparing these newer styles with one another. Too few primary

studies existed to examine all styles together in one analysis. Therefore, Table 4 shows the

relative weights analysis comparing the associations between servant, ethical, authentic and

abusive leadership to trust in the leader. For overall trust in the leader, servant leadership

demonstrated the largest relative contribution (31.39%) compared to the other styles.
