with life’s changes can be enormously stressful. In fact, many stressors can be considered as our reaction to change, whether the change is moving to a new home, ending or beginning a new relationship, or changing ourselves.

Figure . shows how teenagers and young adults are “stressed” by the demands of school and the transition from the security of childhood to the demands of adulthood. Throughout high school, teens experience an enormous amount of change. Change is a major contributor to stress, and it affects both your personal life and your professional life. Why do you think that is so? For most of us, change gives rise to at least one, if not all, of the three responses of fear, resistance, and resentment—all of which ultimately lead to stress. You may have already experienced one of these emotions upon entering college.

Fear When we voluntarily or involuntarily leave a stage of our lives that has become comfortable and predictable, we enter another stage in which we don’t know what will happen. The challenge and potential excitement from the change can produce eustress in people who thrive on unpredictability. But to many of us, fear of the unknown produces negative stress. For example, when you were a senior in high school, did you think a lot about what the future would hold? Although eager to move out of the nest and be on their own, many students respond that they are ter- rified of what could happen. These students don’t know if they will be successful in life—they aren’t even sure that they can get a job to support themselves. They are certain that they will fail in college, which they feel means failing in life!

Other students respond that they are “psyched” about the thought of moving out and trying a new life! For those of you who are more fearful than challenged by change, you are probably already recognizing that the key to handling “fear of the unknown” is seeing that there aren’t the monsters you thought there would be if you made the change. In other words, handling your fears in the future means realizing that most changes do not end up being as bad as you first predicted.

Resistance Let’s face it—some of us just don’t want to leave the security and structure of that which is known. We like the predictability in our lives, no matter how boring. We like knowing what is going to happen from day to day, and telling us that we have to change our routine can throw us into a tailspin. Something as minor as hav- ing to change brands of toothpaste can be too much for us to handle and send us into a determined stubbornness not to change! A good illustration of resistance to change is holding on to old traditions that are no longer feasible. For example, I met a man at a conference who said that for many years after his divorce he still expected to spend Christmases with his former in-laws! It had been a tradition for him for more than  years, and he didn’t understand why that tradition should stop just because he was no longer legally part of the family. He continued to call his ex-wife for several Christmases after the divorce, asking to join in the festivi- ties. Of course, he was turned down, and the continued stress from this rejection and his refusal to change eventually led him to seek counseling. He seems to be doing better now and has even begun trying to start his own holiday traditions with the new woman in his life. Resisting change doesn’t allow people to cope with inevitable changes that come from living. This resistance leads to stress.

Resentment Finally, changes that are forced on us, particularly those that we feel we had no control over or input into, can cause resentment. If we don’t want the change,

don’t understand why we have to make the change, and don’t like how the change makes us feel (e.g., scared and confused), it raises feelings of resentment. Later in this chapter, we will discuss more about how to deal with life’s changes.
