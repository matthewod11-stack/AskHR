# Occupational Stressors

Figure . shows how experience and age contribute to what individuals consider sources of stress. Individuals who have been on their own and in the workforce full time seem preoccupied with the stress that work brings. Occupa- tional stressors can be grouped under two broad categories: job characteristics and organizational characteristics (Cordes & Dougherty, ).

Job Characteristics Three main job characteristics cause stress: role conflict, role ambiguity, and role overload.

Role conflict occurs when our work expectations and what we think we should be doing don’t match up with the work we actually have to do. For example, a woman who was hired as assistant to the chief executive officer (CEO) of one particular organization was informed upon hire that she would be handling such administrative duties as policy development, participating as an equal partner in management meetings, and serving as a liaison between the CEO and the public. However, after she had been on the job for awhile, she heard herself referred to as a “secretary” not only by the CEO but other department heads too. In fact, the work she ended up doing consisted of mainly taking minutes at various meetings,

ensuring that there was food at those meetings, and doing other routine cleri- cal work such as answering the phone and routing interoffice mail. What she expected from the position was incompatible with what she was actually required to do. This role conflict caused her a great deal of stress, and, consistent with research on the effects of role conflict (e.g., Griffeth, Hom, & Gaertner, ; Rahim & Psenicka, ), she eventually quit her job.

Role conflict can also occur when an employee has competing roles or con- flicting roles. For example, an employee’s role as manager may require her to work on a Saturday, but her role as a mother requires her to attend her daughter’s soccer game on the same day.

Role ambiguity occurs when an individual’s job duties and performance expectations are not clearly defined. In the preceding example, the woman expe- rienced not only role conflict but role ambiguity because what her boss expected her to do was different from what the other staff expected her to do. Although her boss referred to her as a “secretary,” a job title that clearly denotes certain duties, he felt that she should have an equal say in certain decisions affecting the organi- zation. The other directors, however, did not consider her their peer and did not feel that she should have the same power or authority that they had. Because the director did not, in the four years she worked there, ever settle that issue, she was never sure just how she was supposed to act at committee meetings. Needless to say, each day brought more and more stress as she struggled to find out, on her own, just what her job responsibilities should be. Consistent with the research of Frone, Russell, and Cooper (), the stress of this role ambiguity caused her to become depressed, and consistent with the meta-analysis by Abramis (), her job satisfaction decreased.

Role overload develops when individuals either feel they lack the skills or workplace resources to complete a task or perceive that the task cannot be done in the required amount of time. Not surprisingly, role overload is highly cor- related with stress (Bolino & Turnley, ). Role overload can cause anxiety, depression, and anger (Rahim & Psenicka, ), especially when employees have little control over their jobs (Karasek & Theorell, ). As suggested in Chapter , the negative consequences of role overload can be reduced if organizations actively ensure that employees have increased control over their jobs (Parker & Sprigg, ).

The key to minimizing the stress that comes from role conflict, ambiguity, and overload is to get clarification about your job duties. Although you are given a job description upon hire, make sure you sit down with your boss to ensure that you know just what he expects from you. In fact, it is wise to discuss the particu- lars of the job description prior to hire so that you are clear about work expecta- tions. If you have been assigned a project you don’t fully understand or feel you can’t complete, let your employer know. Further, if possible, suggest that you be allowed to participate in training that can help you complete the project. Finally, it is sometimes beneficial if your boss explains your job responsibilities to other staff. This explanation should reduce any misunderstanding about your role in the organization.
