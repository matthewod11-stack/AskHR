I’ve long said that the belief that humans fear change is a myth. What

humans actually fear is change that excludes them. And it would seem

this recent wave of relentless change validates that: 49% of workers feel

that they will be left behind from the pace of change. (I recently wrote

about employees’ fears of becoming obsolete, and what they can do to

navigate perceived threats to their ambitions.)

All this intensiﬁed fatigue won’t bode well for legitimate organizational

eﬀorts to improve cultures, build new capabilities and products, and

strengthen market performance. Research from Gartner revealed that

the post-pandemic increase of sizable change initiatives led to a sharp

from 75% in 2016 to just 43% in 2022.

causing it.
