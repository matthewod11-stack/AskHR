which is exacerbated when well-known scholars speak past each other. We sought instead to be mindful of how our perspectives on inclusive leadership ﬁt together to bring shape to a whole that, while admittedly complex, makes sense.

Despite the tendency to conceptualize leadership in terms of the set of traits, styles, or behaviors that yield desired outcomes, what emerged is a shared recognition among us that inclusive leadership is best thought of as a process (McGregor, 1944) that unfolds at multiple stages and levels of analysis (summarized in Figure 1). What we mean by this is that inclusive leadership represents more than a set of surface-level behaviors that can be learned through leadership training. Rather, it involves a dynamic and re- lational process (DeRue, 2011) in which leaders leverage the knowledge and analytical skills they have acquired related to diversity dynamics to inform the speciﬁc approaches needed of them to satisfy the needs of their followers (Morgeson, DeRue, & Karam, 2010) and promote inclusive collective-level interactions within a diverse work context (i.e., what we refer to as moderation of ﬁrst-stage relationships). It also involves “cognitive bootstrapping” (Lord & Hall, 2005), or an iterative, meta-cognitive process through which leaders reﬂect upon the outcomes of their engagement with followers (Petriglieri, Wood, & Petriglieri, 2011) to hone their responses to better address unfolding dynamics (i.e., what we refer to as moderation of second-stage relationships).
