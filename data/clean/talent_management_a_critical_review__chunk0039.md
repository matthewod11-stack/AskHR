organization considers important) is independent of impact (the extent to which the intervention targets strategically important (pivotal) talent pools). As a result, considering effectiveness without regard for impact can lead to poor talent decisions. For instance, training programs that markedly improve the performance of a high average value talent pool, rather than a pivotal talent pool, will have little impact if the improved performance does not improve the execution of the strategy.

Efficiency is a measure of the amount of activity generated for the investment. Decisions are commonly made in HR based on “efficiency” measures, such as number of persons trained per training session, cost per hire, and ratio of HR staff to total employees. Boudreau and Ramstad note that an efficiency focus, absent a focus on effectiveness and impact, results in low cost, standardized, and centralized HR practices. Decisions made purely on the basis of efficiency can emphasize metrics without a true understanding of the implications of the metrics. What, for instance, does it mean to have one-third the HR staff of comparably sized organizations? Without effectiveness and impact measures one cannot determine whether the HR staff is accomplishing one-third the work of comparable organizations or is three times more effective.

Boudreau and Ramstad (2005) have added significantly to the talent discussion by outlining the dynamics by which talent is linked to strategy. By introducing the notion that we need a talent decision science (akin to that of finance and marketing) they go beyond acknowledging that strategic elements influence talent decisions (Jackson & Schuler, 1990; Tichy et al., 1982) or categorizing talent based on labor market or resource-based parameters (Barney, 1991; Zuboff, 1988). Their approach opens the possibility of developing rigorous nonrecursive talent-strategy models. When business leaders understand that talent investments can open strategic opportunities (are not simply a response to strategic decisions) the Human Resources function will finally have its “seat at the table” (Boudreau & Ramstad, 2005).

- 5. A note on talent management analytics

Having agreed that talent management is important, the trade and professional press now seem to have focused on “workforce analytics”. As with the term “talent management” it is difficult to precisely determine what constitutes “workforce analytics”. Once again, we have identified several definitions from practitioners:

- “…performance analytics — a new class of business intelligence that ties human capital management to financial

- “Analytics: Gain deep visibility into staffing processes to analyze and optimize the whole system or improve individual aspects”. (Stepstone, 2005)

- “Analytics: Gain deep visibility into staffing processes to analyze and optimize the whole system or improve individual aspects”. (Stepstone, 2005)

- “…standard metrics and dashboards for various categories of users including recruiters, business executives, hiring managers, human resources and more”. (Kenexa, 2005).

As illustrated by the above three definitions, analytics is either an analytical technique, a process for gaining talent insights, or a set of measures arrayed for a variety of users. In practice, ‘analytics” seems to refer to a set of metrics – collected and computed by a software application – for use by a decision maker. Schweyer (2004b), for instance, outlines some of the decisions facilitated by strong analytics:

If you do proper workforce analytics and planning, then you know who to recruit, who to develop, who to redeploy and where to redeploy them, whether you should hire someone externally or promote someone from within, and whether you should look for a contingent worker, contractor, or full-time worker. Workforce-planning analytics can help you make the best talent-management decisions and align those with your corporate objectives (2004b).

Given Schweyer's definition it is difficult to distinguish the goals or process of analytics from those of succession management, selection and placement, and needs analysis. In fact, we suspect much HR planning is supported by an analysis of recruiting success/hit rates, turnover rates, expatriate placement success rates, and other such measures. If that is the case, why the high interest in analytics?

The drive to develop TM “analytics” seems to be a result of the growing use of enterprise-wide software systems. The promise of software and data management systems that capture human resources, finance, and operations data is that these data can be mined to gain insights with respect to talent that were previously difficult to obtain. On one level we agree. Research that previously required collecting data from various organizational databases, manipulating and keying the data, and aggregating them to the proper level of analysis certainly made the task of doing research more
