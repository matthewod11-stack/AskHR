## psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin and author

of Bring Your Brain to Work: Using Cognitive Science to Get a Job, Do

it Well, and Advance Your Career. Your job is to help the organization

succeed, so “you can ﬁght the policy up to the point where it’s been set

in stone, after which you either enforce it or quit,” he says. You’re not

just a robotic keeper of the rulebook, however. Your role as a leader is to

“enforce the policy in a way that doesn’t undermine it, while at the same

time showing empathy with the people who have to live with it.”
