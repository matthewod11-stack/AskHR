## Satisfaction, Perceived Injustice, Stress, and CWBs

Research has linked satisfaction, perceived injustice, and stress to CWBs. The relationship between job satisfaction and employee turnover has been the focus of much of this research. In particu- lar, many structural models have been created to explain the rela- tionship between job satisfaction and turnover (Bannister & Griffeth, 1986; Dalessio, Silverman, & Schuck, 1986; Hom, Grif- feth, & Sellaro, 1984; Mobley, Horner, & Hollingsworth, 1978). Other meta-analyses have found signiÔ¨Åcant relationships between overall job satisfaction and absenteeism (Hackett, 1989).
