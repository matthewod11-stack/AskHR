## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 171

The above discussion focuses on neuroticism and negative af- fect as personality dimensions for which we can offer broad hy- potheses. It is also worth noting that in speciﬁc circumstances, one could posit relationships between many other personality dimen- sions and perceptions of satisfaction, stress, and injustice. A com- pany policy restricting socializing among employees at work may inﬂuence these perceptions among extraverts but not introverts. A change in job design adding public speaking to work require- ments may be stressful for introverts but not extraverts. A change in work rules setting higher performance standards may be stress- ful to highly conscientious workers concerned about meeting the standard, but not to less conscientious workers not concerned about meeting the standard. As these examples illustrate, such ef- fects are speciﬁc to the situation in question. One would not posit, for example, Extraversion as a generalizable moderator of the job- characteristics–satisfaction relationship.

Personality as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Satisfaction, Perceived Injustice, and Stress and CWBs

Here, we explore the possibility that there are individual differences in the relationship between dissatisfaction, perceived injustice, and stress and engaging in various CWBs. There are two separate issues here: whether dissatisfaction, injustice, and stress lead to engaging in CWBs, and if so, which CWB is exhibited.
