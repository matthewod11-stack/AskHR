# Prompt Engineering

This approach makes ToT pa(cid:457)icularly well-suited for complex tasks that require exploration. It works by maintaining a tree of thoughts, where each thought represents a coherent language

sequence that serves as an intermediate step toward solving a problem. The model can then

explore di(cid:441)erent reasoning paths by branching out from di(cid:441)erent nodes in the tree.

There’s a great notebook, which goes into a bit more detail showing The Tree of Thought

(ToT) which is based on the paper ‘Large Language Model Guided Tree-of-Thought’.9
