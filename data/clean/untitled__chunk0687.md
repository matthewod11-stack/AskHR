## The Scientiﬁc Revolution and a New Understanding of Cognition

The Scientiﬁc Revolution marked a sharp, almost absolute, break in theories of cognition. It presented a new conception of the world: the world as a machine (Henry, 1997). Platonic metaphysical realism died. There were no external, transcen- dental standards by which to judge what was beautiful or just, or even what was a dog and what was a cat. The only reality was the material reality of particular things, and as a result the key cognitive relationship became the relationship be- tween a perceiver and the objects in the material world he perceives and classiﬁes, not the relationship between the ob- ject perceived and the Form it resembles. Aristotle’s percep- tual realism died, too, as scientists and philosophers imposed a veil of ideas between the perceiver and the world perceived. This veil of ideas was consciousness, and it created psychol- ogy as a discipline as well as a new set of problems in the philosophy and psychology of cognition.
