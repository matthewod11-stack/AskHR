# visionary and excellent communicator.

In terms of the environment of support and trust that must exist for dialogue to succeed

(Empathy) it is clear this was largely facilitated by the informal atmosphere that already

existed in Organization X before the acquisition. Right after the acquisition this was not

higher due to the unknown interlocutors and the uncertainty that prevailed in the

context.The same can explain the Input level, that is, change initiatives were open to

change as they were implemented, as the following example:

“…In construction stage we were involving more and more people. I wished they

could talk. First I needed to know the background; I needed to master the sales

managers and needed to measure the reactions(C).Then it was deliberate and

left them talk. But I always did interventions because, "this point has created a

controversy here ... You remember the date of such meeting, we have a record,

and look what you have told us there ... Never mind, if we come to the conclusion

that this should be changed it will be changed ...(P). And what I want to make

clear is that this item was built like that by your observations (M).If we come to

the conclusion that today it is better to change, no problem. We change” (P).
