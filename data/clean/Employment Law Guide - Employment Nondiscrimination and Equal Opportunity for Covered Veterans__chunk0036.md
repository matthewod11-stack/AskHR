## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Covered contractors and subcontractors are required to display the "Know Your Rights" poster. The poster

must be displayed in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment such as, the

personnel oï¬ƒce, work-out facility, lunchroom, or company bulletin board. The contractor must ensure that

applicants or employees who are disabled veterans are provided the notice in a form that is accessible and understandable to the disabled veteran (e.g., providing Braille or large print versions of the notice, posting the

notice for visual accessibility to persons in wheelchairs, providing the notice electronically or on computer

disc, or other versions). With respect to employees who do not work at a physical location of the contractor, a

contractor will satisfy its posting obligations by posting such notices in an electronic format, provided that the

contractor provides computers that can access the electronic posting to such employees, or the contractor has actual knowledge that such employees otherwise are able to access the electronically posted notices.

The "Know Your Rights" poster is available in multiple languages. There is no requirement to display the

poster in languages other than English. There is no particular size requirement.

Contractors that have the obligation to develop a written VEVRAA program must post a notice at each

establishment providing the location and hours it may be viewed. Additionally, covered contractors must post their VEVRAA policy statements on company bulletin boards, and made available in accessible and

understandable format for disabled veterans, if needed (e.g., providing Braille or large print versions of the

notice, or posting the notice for visual accessibility to persons in wheelchairs).

Personnel records. Federal contractors are required to maintain any personnel or employment records made

or kept by the contractor. Examples of records that must be maintained include:
