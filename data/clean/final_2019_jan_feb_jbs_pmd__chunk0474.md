- 8. The Intelligent Restaurant The Koyambedu joint is a bright, air-conditioned nook in the not-so-salubrious environs near the bus terminus, and overlooks the grim wholesale vegetable market. Tucked into a small kiosk at the entrance of Hotel Chennai Deluxe, the ‘Food Box’ is a large, automated vending machine that issues set meals sourced from restaurants across the city. A hulking red- and-yellow contraption, it takes up almost a fourth of the space. Payment can be by card or cash. Barcodes match the order to the right tray inside the food box, and then begins the fun. It’s a concept wherein food is brought from a number of eateries.

And most importantly, it keeps in mind the health of the consumers too - on board is a team of nutritionists that strives to make each meal nutritious, without compromising on the taste.

machine and choose their preferred restaurant along with their choice of pre-determined food combinations. And within 90 seconds, piping hot food in neat packaging slides out of the dispenser, removing human intervention in the entire food packaging and delivery process. It gives convenience to customers. The packing and delivery is also automated and it’s compact and convenient. Consumers can stand in the queue to receive their order and go upstairs where they can dine.”

When a customer chooses the meal from the touch screen and pays for it, the combo number is sent to a computer that directs a robotic arm to match it with the barcode on the right food tray from cold storage. It then travels on an automated conveyor belt where a device pierces holes on the cover of the tray, after which it goes into a microwave and comes out on the same belt piping hot. On receiving an order, the combo number is sent to a computer that directs a robotic arm to pick the right box from cold storage. A conveyor belt takes it to the microwave oven and then to the dispenser. At a time it handles two orders.

The outlet has two screens that clearly explain the process of ordering in three steps. Step 1: Select th e food from the menu displayed on the screen. 2: Pay the bill using any credit or debit card or by cash to the staff behind the screens, who use the food-box card and swipes it. A printed bill with an order code comes out. 3: Take the bill and watch the screen for the order number and then get the food coming out on the conveyer belt. All it takes is 90 seconds.”We did a six- month due diligence on food testing. The food still remains good for eight hours but we have programmed the machine early as we are very conscious about the quality,” says Velumani.

Not only does the dispenser keep the food fresh, the meal is served piping hot like in any of thefavorite restaurants. The system is also designed to never serve food that is approaching the end of its shelf life- ensuring that the food at Foodbox is always fresh.

“My first question was – does the technology for an automated restaurant even exist,” says Satish. As it turns out it didn’t and the toughest, fiddliest part of t heir job was putting it all together. “And now we have India’s first fully automated, multi-brand, food retail- facilitator,” he says, with a dramatic sweep of his hand.
