## HBR / Digital Article / Agentic AI Is Already Changing the Workforce

- And, ultimately, an open question for discussion: How will the very

deﬁnition of “work” evolve when AI agents become embedded in

teams, possibly even gaining legal or ethical status?

It’s not necessary to answer all of these questions upfront, but use them

as a guide and continue to answer them along your journey. These

are not theoretical concerns—they’re strategic inﬂection points. The

organizations that move ﬁrst to resolve them will shape how the future

of work is deﬁned and who controls its value.

As you consider how to move forward, reﬂect on the guiding principle

of human centricity. While AI can handle many tasks more quickly

than humans, your enterprise still relies on the insight, empathy, and

relationships that only people can deliver. By maintaining this dual focus—on unleashing AI’s eﬃciency and safeguarding human creativity

—you stand the best chance of driving sustainable growth.
