## Toward a Theory of Reputation in Organizations

Education, Experience, Expertise, and Demographic Characteristics. Because lifetimes are ﬁnite, age has to be considered in any discussion concerning the value of human capital. The timing of investments in human capital is a factor in the resulting value, with early investments in education and training being likely to yield greater life-long returns. The age of a college graduate reﬂects the potential stream of contributions, in that a younger person would be expected to have greater long-term potential. Also, age serves as a proxy for experience, whereby older individuals are believed to be more experienced.

Education and experience are both components of an individual’s reputation that are affected by age, but the relationship is not always linear. As an example, consider Steve Jobs in his career at Apple computer. Early in his career, Jobs’ reputation as a business visionary far exceeded any multiple of his age with either years of education or experience. In contrast, former IBM CEO John Akers had a reputation that developed over time as a more linear combination of age and experience.

Expertise. Most ﬁelds that study reputation would agree that individuals often are known for excelling in certain areas. In marketing, companies wish (Scherer, 1980). In to be known for producing the ‘‘best’’ product organization theory, companies wish to acquire a reputation for being considered at the top of their ﬁeld (Barney, 1991). The study of inner city gangs has shown us that youths wish to gain a reputation for being tougher than those around them (Elmer, 1984). Most intentional, positive reputations are based on being known for excelling in a speciﬁc task. In fact, it can be argued that perceived expertise by one’s peers is the ﬁrst step toward gaining a reputation.

From the human capital perspective, gender and race have strong implications for reputation. Drawing from signaling theory, value is placed on various individual attributes in lieu of information on the person’s actual capabilities (Spence, 1973). Demographic characteristics, such as gender, race, and age, are part of one’s human capital, and thus one’s reputational make-up. These characteristics might operate directly, as well as inter- actively with other attributes, to load into the composite personal reputation construct.

Reputation also is inﬂuenced by the set of personal characteristics is reﬂective of one’s intelligence, individuals possess, and therefore, personality, and social effectiveness skills. Such characteristics serve as both foundational and facilitative bases of overt behavior, and they inﬂuence how people are perceived and evaluated in work settings, as well as

affecting how individuals perform various aspects of their work roles. We identify and discuss representative constructs in this area, rather than conducting a comprehensive or exhaustive examination.

General Mental Ability. One personal characteristic that we suggest has an inﬂuence on reputation, and has been actively researched for years, is intelligence, cognitive ability, or general mental ability (GMA). Schmidt and Hunter’s (1998) review suggested that GMA tends to be the single most valid predictor of future job performance and learning. We would argue that GMA demonstrates its inﬂuence on reputation the extent to which it guides and facilitates work performance effectiveness.

Possessing GMA, and using it productively in the work environment, is important for reputation, but it is by no means the sole aspect of such personal capital. Indeed, the direct inﬂuence of GMA, as the primary predictor of individual performance, has been called into question when non-cognitive variables have been proposed to challenge its predictive effectiveness (McClelland, 1993; Sternberg & Wagner, 1993). Instead of posing arguments promoting a single personal characteristic, contemporary thinking seems to favor consideration of predictors that supplement the contribution of GMA, which might include personality measures and social effectiveness skills. We certainly see this is to be the case for the reputation construct.

Personality and Social Effectiveness. Personality characteristics and social effectiveness reﬂect a second category of personal qualities that collectively we believe build personal capital and reputation. Patterns of behavior that individuals demonstrate at work, which are generated by personality traits, can expect to exert a strong inﬂuence on the reputations they earn. The program of research by Mount and Barrick (1995) has helped to establish the role of personality in the prediction of job performance (i.e., with particular reference to the Five-Factor Model). As a consequence of this research, personality generally is viewed by organizational scientists as possessing considerable potential to improve our understanding of people in organizations and their work behavior, including shedding important light on reputation.

Social effectiveness competencies contribute to personal reputation as well. The ability to effectively read, understand, and control social interactions in the workplace has been of interest to behavioral scientists for quite some time. In the organizational context, social effectiveness is reﬂected in the effective exercise of persuasion, explanation, and other
