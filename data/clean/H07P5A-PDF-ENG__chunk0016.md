# accurate picture of their eﬀorts.

Initially, the data showed that women were more accurate in their

estimations of the time a task would take, although they often overestimated the diﬃculty of tasks. Meanwhile, men underestimated both the time a task would take and its diﬃculty. Following the

intervention, the likelihood of women accurately identifying the diﬃculty of the task increased by a factor of 28, while men were 12.5

times more likely to do so. Additionally, men became 7 times more

likely to accurately estimate the time required for a task, whereas there

was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in this aspect for women.
