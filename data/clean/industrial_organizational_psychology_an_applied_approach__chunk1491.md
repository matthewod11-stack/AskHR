# Making the Hiring Decision

After valid and fair selection tests have been administered to a group of appli- cants, a final decision must be made as to which applicant or applicants to hire. At first, this may seem to be an easy decision—hire the applicants with the high- est test scores. But the decision becomes more complicated as both the number and variety of tests increase.

If more than one criterion-valid test is used, the scores on the tests must be combined. Usually, this is done by a statistical procedure known as multiple regression, with each test score weighted according to how well it pre- dicts the criterion. Linear approaches to hiring usually take one of four forms: unadjusted top-down selection, rules of three, passing scores, or banding.
