# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 237

ing outcomes. More speciﬁcally, trait and outcome measures have tended to reﬂect stability in the person and situation, respectively. Increasingly, however, learners are becoming active participants in their own learning process, which leads to a more serious need to expand research in understanding learning situations and person- learning situation interactions. Recent research in personality psy- chology has offered some insights and methodologies relevant to this type of learning research.

In his review of personality research, Funder (2001) notes that the goal of personality theory has to be focused on increasing our un- derstanding of the interconnections among person, situation, and behavior. In particular, knowing about a person and his or her sit- uation should allow for predicting what he or she will do in that situation—or that understanding the person and knowing the be- havior exhibited should then tell us something about the situation the person is in. New perspectives have sought to locate the per- son within context, examine traits and behavioral variation, and understand the link between traits and psychological states and processes. These new perspectives have much to offer to research- ers interested in expanding the domain of research on personal- ity, learning processes, and learning outcomes.

In personality research, much effort in the 1980s and 1990s was focused on developing a consistent and coherent set of personality constructs for organizational research, particularly in personnel se- lection. As Hough and Schneider noted (1996), the development of personality and performance taxonomies has proven useful in ﬁnding clearer relationships between personality traits and im- portant criterion elements that had been previously obscured. As- sessment tools to operationalize these constructs have been well developed (for example, see Ozer & Reise, 1994), and the average or traited response of a person has been found to be useful in pre- dicting or explaining both training outcomes and job performance (Barrick & Mount, 1991).

Although traits are important in reﬂecting an individual’s con- sistent or typical behavior across situations, recent research efforts have begun to expand our understanding of personality as a more dynamic characteristic of a person. Similarly, there has been greater recognition that situations may contain different relevant psychological characteristics for different individuals.
