# another.

Conventional wisdom holds that the best course of action in CEO

successions is for the key players to deepen their interpersonal

relationships—revealing more about their expectations and objectives,

showing appreciation for one another’s wants and needs, listening with

empathy, making others feel welcome, seeking common ground, and

cooperating. That isn’t enough. The new leader must convince key

people, who have their own agendas and biases, that she is the best

choice for the job and then earn their loyalty and conﬁdence. Great

managers do this by using a broad repertoire of approaches to inﬂuence

and persuade others. The ability to do that is the essence of leadership,

and it is particularly critical for designated CEO successors.
