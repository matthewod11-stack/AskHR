# descriptive.

You might end up with a short list of bullet points or a one-sentence

summary of your vision. No matter how you capture it, a vision

statement can be powerful in guiding your life. An example we love

comes from our colleague Sebastian when he was 14. After a poor math

test result, his teacher told him, “Teaching you is a waste of time” and

warned he’d never get a high school diploma. For the next couple of

years Sebastian took that to heart, skipped school, and started working

as a bricklayer. Eventually, however, he decided to make a change, and it

began with this vision statement: “I will go to university and get a PhD

and then go back to my math teacher — all in the next 10 years.” He did

just that, graduating summa cum laude with a PhD in economics, and in

another 10 years he was a managing director and a partner at BCG.

- 4. How do I assess my life portfolio?

Companies typically use portfolio analysis to assess their business units

on key parameters such as market growth or share and to decide where

to invest capital. BCG is well-known for its 2×2 growth-share matrix.
