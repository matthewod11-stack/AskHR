# Guide for Employee Beneﬁt Plans(https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/ﬁles/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-

center/publications/reporting-and-disclosure-guide-for-employee-beneﬁt-plans.pdf) has been prepared by EBSA with

assistance from PBGC. It is intended to be used as a quick reference tool for certain basic disclosure

requirements under ERISA. Not all ERISA disclosure requirements are reﬂected in this guide. For example, the guide, as a general matter, does not focus on disclosures required by the Internal Revenue Code or the

provisions of ERISA for which the IRS has regulatory and interpretive authority.
