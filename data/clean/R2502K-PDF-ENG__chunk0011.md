# The Cost of Uniqueness Bias

To quantify the eﬀect of perceived uniqueness on projects, we asked the

managers of each of the 219 projects in our sample to indicate, on a scale

of one to 10, how much they agreed with the statement “This project is unique, and therefore it is diﬃcult to compare with other projects.”

Twenty-seven percent gave their project a score of seven or higher.

Next we tested the association between perceived uniqueness and

performance, which we assessed by measuring the beneﬁts delivered

and cost and schedule overruns. The results supported our hypothesis

that project leaders’ view of projects as unique was correlated with

underperformance. We found that a one-point increase on the 10-point

scale was associated, on average, with a ﬁve-percentage-point increase

in cost overruns. That meant that in projects receiving the highest

rating—a 10—cost overruns were 45 percentage points higher, on

average, than overruns in projects receiving the lowest rating (a one).

Worryingly, in 37% of the projects rated a 10, the cost overrun was

extreme—exceeding the budget by more than 75%.

It should be noted that the above conclusions are based on perceived

uniqueness. As we discovered, the perceptions didn’t necessarily match
