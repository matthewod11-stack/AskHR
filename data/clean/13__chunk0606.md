Porter and Beuf (1991) examined differences between the reactions of white and black patients to vitiligo (a disÔ¨Åguring skin disease). Results showed that these groups did not differ in terms of the extent to which they were disturbed by the condition. However, blacks perceived the condition to be more stigmatizing than did whites.

Interplay between Cognitions and Emotions In accordance with Arrows 18 and 19 in the SIO model, there is considerable support for the view that there is an interplay between cognitions about and emotional responses to a target (e.g., Dijker, 1989; Mackie & Hamilton, 1993; Vanman & Miller, 1993), including the perspective that emotions affect cognitions about targets. In this regard, Bodenhausen (1993) argued that strong emotions, whether negative (e.g., anger, anxiety) or positive (e.g., happiness) generally disrupt the capacity of observers to process information about targets. As a result, observers rely more on stereotype- based cognitions about their attributes. In addition, Stephan and Stephan (1993) argued that cognitions and affect are interconnected, parallel networks in which stereotypes about targets involve cognitions (e.g., about behaviors, traits) that are linked to emotions. As a result, the affect stemming from intergroup contact can elicit cognitions that are tied to the group.
