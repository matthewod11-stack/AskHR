# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

particularly diﬃcult for women to break in, to rise. She’d love to hear, is

there progress there? Or what needs to happen there? It seems to be a uniquely diﬃcult environment for women these days.

DEB LIU:

I founded a non-proﬁt called Women in Product, and part of it was that

I started out in a ﬁeld, product management, and these are the people

who decide what products you see, what apps were on your phone,

how things are designed across hundreds of companies, thousands of

companies where you interact with their products. It’s the product

manager who actually sets the roadmap and what gets launched. And

when I started in that ﬁeld, it was 50/50 men and women. And then

somewhere along the way I woke up one day and it was less than

10% women, and I just did not know what happened. And I spent

years looking into it and we realized that, at some point in 2004,

Google decided they wanted their product managers to have a computer

science degree. And less than 20% of computer science degrees are

earned by women.

So you’re probably wondering why I’m telling you the story. Well,

basically, we went from a ﬁeld where there were lots of women, lots

of diverse voices, to many fewer diverse voices. And so while we think

we’re making progress, sometimes we see setbacks as well. And then we

have to work our way back up towards more equality. But something

interesting happens. Amongst the ﬁeld of product management, that is

also where future founders come from. That’s where they fund people

with ideas because these are builders. And so, again, you see fewer

startups getting funded and all women teams only make up 3% of VC

funding whereas even with mixed teams, men and women, it’s about

18%. So you can’t tell me that 82% of the best ideas in the world are from

one gender because that’s not true. So we still have a lot of work to do.
