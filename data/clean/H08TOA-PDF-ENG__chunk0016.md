# back out of the meeting entirely.

Throughout the whole process, you’ll want to be aware of the temptation

to take tasks back, especially at the ﬁrst sign of a mistake or hesitation.

When Tina, the CFO I worked with, delegated the annual budget presentations, she actually took the day oﬀ when her team was working

on it and went to a movie so she wouldn’t be tempted to check up

on them. I’m not saying everyone should go to the movies when they

delegate a task, but you should remember one thing in times like these:

you probably weren’t as good when you ﬁrst started performing the task

as you are today.
