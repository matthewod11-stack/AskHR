# Two Distinct Psychologies of Emotion 159

through the history of the psychology of emotion. Over 100 years later, we still ﬁnd some psychologists who search for “fundamental” emotions whose origin is often found in the common language and subtle linguistic distinctions among feelings, emotions, and affects. James considered such at- tempts purely “verbal.”

Another theme that deﬁned the psychology of emotion, particularly in the United States, was the behaviorist insis- tence that conscious experience be abandoned as a proper subject of psychology. One of the results was that emotional behavior tended to be the sole target of emotion research during the second quarter of the twentieth century and that emotion in human and in nonverbal animals was studied at the same level. That made it possible to investigate emotional behavior in the cat and rat and to generalize that to human emotions. Finally, both the focus on observables and the James-Lange emphasis on visceral events made research on emotion almost exclusively a program of investigating vis- ceral events and their concomitants.

Theories of emotion suffered the same fate as other theo- retical endeavors in psychology. In the nineteenth century and before, they were primarily concerned with the explana- tion of conscious events. With the advent of Freud, the Würzburg school and its discovery of imageless thought, the Gestalt school in Germany, theoretical notions and particu- larly the emphasis on nonconscious events abounded. The movement to the (theoretical) unconscious went into decline in the United States during the behaviorist interlude to be res- urrected with renewed energy after mid–twentieth century. The “new” cognitive psychology—actually just a theory-rich psychology—postulated that conscious events were a second- ary phenomenon and that most of the interesting theoretical events were not conscious at all but rather the unobservable background of activations and interactions (sometimes mapped into a neuropsychology) that made action and thought possible.
