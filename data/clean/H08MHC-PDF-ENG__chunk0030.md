# HBR / Digital Article / Design Your Transformation for Simplicity — Not Efficiency

created to accomplish the objectives are complete and workable before the new sustainability rules are put into eﬀect.

For example, part of the new workﬂow is getting existing and

prospective suppliers to agree to abide by the new requirements.

Procurement and legal should work together to write model contract language. Within procurement, leaders, managers, and staﬀ should

collaboratively devise practical negotiation strategies for reaching

acceptable agreements with suppliers who are initially unwilling or

unable to abide by the new contract language.

This solves two challenges. First, it ensures that users have what they

need to complete the workﬂow at the time the new sustainability mandate takes eﬀect. By doing this work in advance, staﬀ are not

simultaneously trying to write their own contract language, decide

for themselves if variations to that language are acceptable, and

make up negotiation strategies on the spot, all of which blunt the

transformation’s eﬃcacy and cause frustration for all involved.

Second, it ensures not just that staﬀ have tools, but that they have eﬀective tools. If the legal department, in its zeal to protect

the company’s interests, writes contract language tilted too far in their favor, they’ve put procurement staﬀ at a disadvantage when

negotiations start; some suppliers, for instance, won’t bother entering

into negotiations if the starting point is too far from what they can agree to. And when procurement leaders, managers, and staﬀ collaborate

on negotiation strategies, it ensures that these strategies reﬂect the ﬁrsthand staﬀ knowledge about their suppliers and counterparts that

would otherwise be absent.

It’s worth reiterating that, core to the designed simplicity approach, is understanding the diﬀerence between input and feedback. Input
