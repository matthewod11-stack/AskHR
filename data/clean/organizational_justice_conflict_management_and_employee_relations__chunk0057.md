(cid:129) OJ: the construct of organizational justice was measured using a five-item scale, out of which two items were adapted from Colquitt et al. (2002), one item from Rupp and Cropanzano (2002), and two items (“fair work schedule” and “fairness in promotion”) were added by the author. Cronbach’s α of all the items is 0.94.
