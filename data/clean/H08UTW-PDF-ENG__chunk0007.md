## Stanford Graduate School of Business and to Silicon Valley professionals

through Stanford Continuing Studies. Today, it remains a central part

of my coaching work with executives and teams. I’ve seen ﬁrsthand

how the technique creates space for contribution and drives progress

when alignment and innovation are most needed. But I’ve also

seen it misunderstood, misapplied, or reduced to a buzzword. When

that happens, “yes, and…” loses its power and can even derail the

collaboration it’s meant to foster.

Here are the top ﬁve mistakes I’ve observed leaders make with “yes,

and…” Let’s break each down and talk about what to do instead.

Mistake #1: Not using “yes, and..” judiciously or transparently

Many of the leaders I work with worry that embracing “yes, and…” in

meetings will slow down decision-making. They picture everyone piling

on idea after idea without pausing to sift, debate, analyze, and come to

the best solution. But this only happens when the tool is not being used

judiciously—when it’s being applied too broadly or at the wrong time.
