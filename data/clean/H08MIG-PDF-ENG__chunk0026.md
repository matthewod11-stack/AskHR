## on the larger workgroup and the organization.

. . .

At its core, handling misconduct is a “people problem” involving

complicated feelings and relationships. Leniency can be a powerful

response if managers consider the whole picture — what was the

misconduct, how does it inﬂuence myself and others, are there personal

issues to consider, and what are the consequences for the broader

group? We suggest leniency should come with a warning label: Use with

care and when compassion and forgiveness are present.
