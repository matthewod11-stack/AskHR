# 2.2.3 Development Plan

An important step before the review cycle begins is for the supervisor and employee to agree on a development plan. At a minimum, this plan should include identifying areas that need improvement and setting goals to be achieved in each area. Development plans usually include both results and behaviors. The topic of development plans is addressed in detail in Chapter 8.

In summary, performance planning includes the consideration of results and behaviors and the development plan. A discussion of results needs to include key accountabilities (i.e., broad areas for which an employee is responsible), specific objectives for each key accountability (i.e., goals to be reached), and performance standards (i.e., what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable levels of performance). Adiscussion of behaviors needs to include competencies (i.e., clusters of KSAs). Finally, the development plan includes a description of areas that need improving and goals to be achieved in each area.

Once the prerequisites are met and the planning phase has been completed, we are ready to begin the implementation of the performance management system. This includes performance execution, assessment, review, and renewal and recontracting.
