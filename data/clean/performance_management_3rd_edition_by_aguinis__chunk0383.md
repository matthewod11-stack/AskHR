# Performance Planning at Discover

At Discover (http://www.discoverfinancial.com/data/corporate/), steps are being taken to ensure that performance planning and employee development support the organization’s business goals. Discover Financial Services is a business unit of Morgan Stanley, and operates the Discover® Card brands. The business offers a variety of cards including the Discover Classic Card, the Discover Gold Card, the Discover Platinum Card, the Miles Card from Discover Card, and an array of affinity cards. Additional services include Discover CDs and Money Market Accounts, auto insurance, and home loans. Discover is headquartered in Riverwoods, Illinois, and employs approximately 14,000 people. Discover has initiated an approach that addresses the development needs of specific business units by assigning human resources professionals to attend business meetings regularly to gain an understanding of what knowledge, skills, and abilities are required. The company asks managers to go through the same curriculum with classroom and online learning opportunities. These managers form discussion groups to discuss what they’ve learned and how it applies to the challenges of their specific role. In addition, part of the strategy includes meeting with employees to agree upon metrics in the performance planning stage, creating an action plan, and following up with evaluations and ratings to determine to what degree the learning experience was successful. In summary, Discover utilizes the various stages of the performance management process to ensure that employee development is a focus that matches the mission of providing a workplace that supports high performance.11

the resulting teaching evaluations are deficient (i.e., lower than the standard of 2). This is an example of a situation in which behaviors should be given more importance than results. In this situation, the evaluation could include competencies such as online communication skills (e.g., in the chat room).
