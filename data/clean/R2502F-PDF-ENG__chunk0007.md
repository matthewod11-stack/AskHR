## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

Many negotiators attempt to show respect by adapting to their

counterpart’s rituals. That is a dangerous negotiation approach—even

more so if you face a win-lose counterpart intent on taking advantage of

you. As we saw with the German negotiator earlier, when you adapt to

your counterpart’s rituals, you cede the power to determine what is or

is not appropriate in your negotiation. Similarly, forcing counterparts

to adapt to your rituals is a win-lose move; the cognitive challenge

of negotiating outside their comfort zone will likely compromise their

# performance.

Instead of adapting, cross-cultural negotiators should create a new set

of desired rituals together. They should engage in open conversations

to deﬁne what a good relationship means, decide how much time they

are willing to invest in building it, and lay out the process for working

This can be challenging. Negotiators should make their own rituals

explicit up front, share the intentions behind them, and discuss how

adopting each other’s rituals may introduce diﬃculties. In one instance

of this, two teams from Switzerland and Spain were starting a long-

term negotiation that would require regular meetings. Aware of their wide cultural diﬀerences, the teams jointly created a simple, shared

document, which they named hoja de ruta (road map), written in

Spanish because one of the Swiss team members was ﬂuent in the

language. In this document, they outlined the ﬁve positive behaviors

they expected from each other during the negotiations, codifying

collaborative intentions on both sides. Then they created a ritual

around it: At the start of meetings, each person would brieﬂy share

a positive hoja de ruta behavior performed by a member of the other

## team. Deviations from the desired behaviors or necessary updates to the

document were also discussed. This ritual allowed each negotiator to

connect with and feel appreciated by the other team, while explicitly carving out time to discuss their relationship-building eﬀorts and

direction. It helped set a positive, collaborative tone, which became

the foundation for mutual understanding—without team members’

needing to become experts in each other’s cultural practices.

In any cross-cultural negotiation, it is important for teams to have

ongoing conversations about their shared rituals and behavior. Skipping

or phasing out these conversations usually results in negotiators from

each side defaulting to their preferred ways of operating and increases

## the odds of misunderstanding and miscommunication.

If adapting to another culture’s ritual appeals to you, then go ahead and

enjoy the experience, but beware of the implications and the cognitive
