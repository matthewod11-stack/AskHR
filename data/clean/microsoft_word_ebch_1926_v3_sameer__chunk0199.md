Organizational culture is a vital aspect of any company, shaping its values, beliefs, and behaviors. It is the collective personality of an organization, encompassing its shared values, traditions, and norms. This culture plays a pivotal role in determining the organization's identity and influences how employees interact, make decisions, and perceive their roles within the company.Organizational culture is often compared to the DNA of a company. It is not something that can be easily changed, and it often develops organically over time as a result of the organization's history, leadership, and external influences. It's the invisible force that guides the actions and decisions of everyone within the organization.
