Author’s note: This article is inspired by the 2023 St. Gallen Symposium, a student-driven global platform for cross-generational dialogue involving senior and emerging leaders, to discuss pressing issues and enact change. Under the title “A New Generational Contract,” this year’s main symposium and year-round initiatives explored intergenerational connections, mutual obligations, and shared responsibilities for future generations.
