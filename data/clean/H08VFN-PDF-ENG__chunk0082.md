To ensure that training is student-centered, cadre should remember:

although the exercise’s immediate purpose is to challenge students,

its ultimate purpose is to create leaders. When a student produces

a plan that contradicts what cadre would have done, cadre should

resist the urge to criticize or correct the student. Instead, cadre should

disinterestedly consider whether the plan is feasible. If it is, cadre

should congratulate the student for doing something smart that they

wouldn’t have done. This technique fosters leaders, because leadership

is, at root, acting intelligently—and independently.
