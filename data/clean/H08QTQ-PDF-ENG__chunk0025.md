# visible.

Senior leaders can play a critical role by providing guidance and

training that help frontline managers communicate these pathways

to their teams. That includes encouraging initiative-seeking behaviors

such as expressing interest in stretch assignments, pursuing high-

visibility projects, cultivating relationships with inﬂuential colleagues,

and identifying opportunities for sponsorship and skill-building.

Just as important is ensuring those messages are delivered equitably

and systematically. Organizations should establish processes that

help managers track whom they’re developing—and whom they may

be overlooking. Tools for documenting development conversations,

prompts in performance reviews, or dashboards that highlight

participation in stretch opportunities are all good options. By

promoting consistent and inclusive communication across teams,

organizations can help level the playing ﬁeld and ensure all employees

have access to the same knowledge.
