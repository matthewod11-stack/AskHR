## HBR / Digital Article / What Companies Still Get Wrong About Layoffs

Corporate decision-making is under a microscope.

Businesses have always needed to justify their actions, but today

corporate reasoning is subjected to wider scrutiny in both traditional

other companies to commit to doing the same. Many companies,

including Starbucks, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley assured staﬀ

that, barring a performance issue, jobs were secure through the end

of 2020. Other CEOs made similar temporary no-layoﬀ pledges to help
