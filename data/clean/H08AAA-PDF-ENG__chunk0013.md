- 2. Measure Your Team’s Motivation

When teams get stuck in vicious cycles and aren’t improving, high

performers get frustrated. In contrast, teams that measure motivation

have a blameless, action-oriented conversation about how to improve

and where they’re getting stalled out. This allows high performers to

take ownership, facilitate problem solving, and build a team culture

that’s worth sticking around for.
