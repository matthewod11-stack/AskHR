issues). At the level of ethical guidelines and professional responsibilities, the broadest deﬁnition of “forensic psychol- ogy” applies best. Any psychologist (e.g., clinical, social, cognitive, developmental) who works within the legal system should be held to the same high ethical and professional stan- dards that are presented in the APA Code of Ethics and the AP-LS Specialty Guidelines. But the clinical/nonclinical dis- tinction is still a meaningful one. For example, education, training, and licensing issues that are pertinent to clinical forensic psychologists may be irrelevant or inapplicable to nonclinical forensic psychologists (e.g., a one-year clinical internship). Further, clinicians and nonclincians differ in their orientation to the legal process and in the role they are likely to play in the courtroom. Clinicians are more likely to present assessments of speciﬁc individuals, while nonclinicians are more likely to present research-based social-fact evidence that applies to people in general.
