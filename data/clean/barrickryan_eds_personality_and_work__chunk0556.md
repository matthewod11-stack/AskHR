# 174 PERSONALITY AND WORK

measures the broader construct of neuroticism. According to Costa and McCrae (1992), neuroticism is characterized by the six facets of anxiety, angry hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, and vulnerability. One can readily imagine that individuals high on the depression facet speciﬁcally may react to perceptions of stress, injustice, and dissatisfaction very differently from individuals who are high on the angry hostility component. In the former case, we would hypothesize that reactions to the perceptual variables might manifest themselves in more withdrawal types of behaviors, such as absenteeism or production deviance, whereas in the latter case, the reactions might include more aggressive behaviors, such as theft or inappropriate verbal or physical actions.

Individuals who are high on Extraversion are often described as friendly, sociable, warm, and outgoing (Costa & McCrae, 1992). What will the reactions of these people be to organizational dis- satisfaction, stress, or perceptions of injustice? Although little re- search bears on this question, it seems reasonable to take our cue from the stress-response literature. In general, research has demon- strated that extraverted individuals use more problem-based cop- ing strategies in reaction to stressful events than introverts do (McCrae & Costa, 1986; Vollrath, Banholzer, Caviezel, Fischli, & Jungo, 1994). Highly extraverted individuals also tend to seek out more social support in reaction to stressful events than introverts do and to be more restrained in their reaction to stress (McCrae & Costa, 1986). As many commentators have noted, these re- sponses are not altogether unexpected. Because individuals high on Extraversion, or positive emotionality, are prone to feeling joy- ful, attentive, and enthusiastic, we would expect them to look for positive ways of dealing with perceptions of stress, dissatisfaction, and injustice. Two of these methods are to seek out support from others and look for realistic solutions to problems. Thus, unless the social support received is in the form of suggestions for retal- iatory behavior against the company, we would not expect ex- traverts to engage in many counterproductive behaviors in response to these perceptions.

Individuals who are conscientious are dutiful, orderly, self- disciplined, competent, and achievement striving and are de- scribed by words such as thorough, organized, industrious, efﬁcient and enterprising (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Little research bears on
