### **[3. From human resources to human essence]{.underline}**

[Here\'s an uncomfortable truth: AI will soon do most routine cognitive
work better than humans. Not just data entry or basic analysis, but
complex problem-solving, creative writing, even strategic
planning.]{.underline}

[So what becomes of human value? Everything that makes us irreplaceably
human becomes infinitely more valuable. Not our ability to process
information, but our capacity for genuine empathy and connection, moral
imagination and ethical reasoning, meaning-making and purpose creation,
authentic creativity and pathbreaking original thought, and navigating
ambiguity and paradox.]{.underline}

[This shift redefines everything about talent. Hiring transforms from
focusing on credentials to character and creativity. Communication
skills and EQ in abundance. Development shifts from building skills to
unleashing human potential. Evaluation moves from measuring productivity
to assessing contribution to culture. Rewards transition from
recognizing execution to celebrating innovation and
insight.]{.underline}

[Leaders must now manage something unprecedented: identity crises at
scale as entire professions transform. The question isn\'t \"How do we
upskill?\" but \"How do we help people find meaning when machines do the
work?\"]{.underline}
