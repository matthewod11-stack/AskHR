### **[4. From hierarchical authority to network influence]{.underline}**

[Traditional org charts assumed knowledge flowed downward. Seniors knew
more. Experience meant expertise. Authority came from
position.]{.underline}

[AI destroys this assumption. When a junior employee with AI can
outperform a senior executive\'s analysis, what happens to
hierarchy?]{.underline}

[It evolves into something radically different. Influence without
position emerges in liquid, project-based structures. Credibility comes
through your contribution and the ability to find yourself in the right
places with the right problems where you can shine, not just title.
Leadership becomes a matter of orchestration, not command of
resources.]{.underline}

[You\'re no longer leading humans alone. You\'re leading hybrid Human-AI
teams where the AI might be the smartest participant in the room. Your
value isn\'t in being the expert - it\'s in being the integrator, the
sense-maker, the wisdom-keeper.]{.underline}
