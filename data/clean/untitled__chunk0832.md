# Equilibration

Piaget (1926, 1928, 1952, 1972), like many other theorists of intelligence, recognized the importance of adaptation to in- telligence. Indeed, he believed adaptation to be its most im- portant principle. In adaptation, individuals learn from the environment and learn to address changes in the environ- ment. Adjustment consists of two complementary processes: assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation is the process

of absorbing new information and ﬁtting it into an already existing cognitive structure about what the world is like. The complementary process, accommodation, involves forming a new cognitive structure in order to understand information. In other words, if no existing cognitive structure seems ade- quate to understand new information, a new cognitive struc- ture must be formed through the accommodation process.

The complementary processes of assimilation and accom- modation, taken together in an interaction, constitute what Piaget referred to as equilibration. Equilibration is the bal- ancing of the two, and it is through this balance that people either add to old schemas or form new ones. A schema, for Piaget, is a mental image or action pattern. It is essentially a way of organizing sensory information. For example, we have schemas for going to the bank, riding a bicycle, eating a meal, visiting a doctor’s ofﬁce, and the like.
