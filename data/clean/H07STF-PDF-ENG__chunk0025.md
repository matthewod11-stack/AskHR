## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

which is how it’s used. Is the organization able to use it? Are people

able to adapt and make the most of it? All of those things remain to be

seen. But certainly, it is worth experimenting with, keeping an eye on it,

studying, asking the good questions.

ADI IGNATIUS:

So here’s a question related to technology. This is from Bhaskaran in

Bangalore. Bhaskaran says that after working for 21 years in HR they

decided to move to a smaller organization, expecting it to be nimble,

agile and all that. It turned out to be highly toxic. Bhaskaran longs for

a new role and organization, but has this constant fear of uncertainty.

How does one deal with this inevitable fear of uncertainty when one is

thinking about making a move?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

Completely understandable. Unfortunately, often the process of making

a career change can be one step forward, two steps back. Now you’ve

learned something, and I think part of what you’ve learned is that you

need to really research much more carefully the context you’re going

to, and get a ﬂavor of them as much as you possibly can. Now you’ve

learned to inquire much more about culture, to talk to the people, to

research the organization. All of that is really important.

It’s one of the reasons why, in studies I’ve done, oftentimes the

uncertainty of “I don’t know what I want, I don’t know how long this

is going to take,” starts to get at people. And then all of a sudden an

option comes up, an oﬀer, with this smaller, more nimble ﬁrm, and it’s

the savior. So they take it, because otherwise they’re still in the throes of

“What am I going to do?”, without researching it as much as they might.
