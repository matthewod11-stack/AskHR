# The Pay-to-Quit Program

One such strategy is to oﬀer employees money to resign voluntarily —

the so-called Pay-to-Quit strategy. Zappos, the online shoe and clothing

retailer, was the ﬁrst to employ the strategy, making what has become

known as “the oﬀer”: a bonus for new hires to quit following a four-week

training period if they didn’t feel that their job was a good ﬁt for them.

oﬀer during training, they raised it all the way up to $4,000, and still

almost no one took it — a sign that the company’s workforce was highly

motivated.

Amazon, which bought Zappos in 2009, adopted a variation of this

strategy. Here’s how Jeﬀ Bezos explained it in his letter to shareholders

associates to quit. The ﬁrst year the offer is made, it’s for $2,000.

Then it goes up $1,000 a year until it reaches $5,000. The headline

on the offer is “Please Don’t Take This Offer.” We hope they don’t take

the offer; we want them to stay. Why do we make this offer? The goal

is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they

really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they

don’t want to be isn’t healthy for the employee or the company.

Amazon made its program available to warehouse workers for years, but
