# ENPS and Engagement(cid:32)

ENPS is central to enhancing engagement, which in(cid:327)uences the overall performance and drive of

employees within the organiza(cid:415)on. Engagement and ENPS are importance because engagement

is a backbone to organiza(cid:415)ons success; a higher engaged workforce would have a higher likelihood

of being invested in their assigned job roles and performing their func(cid:415)ons be(cid:425)er. Furthermore, a

more engaged workforce would indicate employees having stronger loyalty to their organiza(cid:415)ons.(cid:52)(cid:32)

By implemen(cid:415)ng a frequent measurement of eNPS, an organiza(cid:415)on can undertake an assessment

of the sen(cid:415)ments exuded by their workforce which allows for them in addressing issues which

could impact on the engagement of their employees. Addi(cid:415)onally, by listening to employees and

undertaking relevant ac(cid:415)ons based on the feedback which their employees have provided, a

posi(cid:415)ve work environment which fosters the produc(cid:415)vity and engagement of their employees

could be done. (cid:53)(cid:32)

It is important to note that organiza(cid:415)ons which have a high eNPS score have a tendency of having

lower rates of a(cid:425)ri(cid:415)on; evidence iden(cid:415)(cid:302)es that (cid:302)rms with lower eNPS have higher a(cid:425)ri(cid:415)on rates,

which for organiza(cid:415)ons could result in increase in talent reten(cid:415)on costs in addi(cid:415)on to training

costs, impac(cid:415)ng the overall expenditure and net pro(cid:302)ts of organiza(cid:415)ons.(cid:32)

Addi(cid:415)onally, when an organiza(cid:415)ons eNPS is high, it is indica(cid:415)ve that the organiza(cid:415)on has more

promoters than detractors; promoters describe employees who are willing to ac(cid:415)vely promote the

products and services of the organiza(cid:415)on, while detractors describe employees who are unlikely

or unwilling to engage in ac(cid:415)ve promo(cid:415)on of the products and services of an organiza(cid:415)on.(cid:54)(cid:32)

Measuring the eNPS(cid:32)

The ENPS is key metric developed on the basis of the NPS which is a widely-recognized customer

loyalty sa(cid:415)sfac(cid:415)on metric, which organiza(cid:415)ons globally use in tracking their brand health, and

loyalty of consumers to the products or services they provide. Net promo(cid:415)on scores are measured

based on the ques(cid:415)on “How likely is it that you would recommend this brand to a friend or

colleague?” using a scale of 0 (not likely at all) to 10 (extremely likely).(cid:32)

This ques(cid:415)on facilitates organiza(cid:415)ons in tracking detractors and promoters.(cid:32)

The Employee Net Promoter Score can be calculated by subtrac(cid:415)ng the Net detractors present in

the organiza(cid:415)on (the percen(cid:415)le represen(cid:415)ng responses between 0 and 6 on the scale, from the

promoters (percen(cid:415)le represen(cid:415)ng responses between 9 and 10 on the scale). Passive 7-8 are

categorised as neither promoters nor detractors.(cid:55)(cid:32)

To iden(cid:415)fy the extent to which your organiza(cid:415)on performed in terms of eNPS, best prac(cid:415)ces

suggest using the benchmarks provided by Bain and Company. Scores above 0 is good, above 20 is

favorable, and above 50 is denoted as excellent.(cid:56)(cid:32)
