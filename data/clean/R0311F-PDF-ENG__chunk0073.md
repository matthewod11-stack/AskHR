If companies can’t prove basic causality, they certainly can’t determine the relative im- portance of the measures they select. And not being able to weigh these measures makes it hard to allocate resources according to their most beneficial uses or to create meaningful incentive plans. For instance, does a dollar in- vested in product development yield higher re- turns than a dollar spent on customer reten- tion?

In the absence of such knowledge, compa- nies in our study came up with various solu- tions for assigning relative weights to different measures. One of the simplest solutions was to give each performance measure equal weight. As one executive at a consumer electronics manufacturer put it, “It’s difficult to precisely assign weightings, so I just assume they are of equal importance.” But perhaps even more of- ten, managers base weightings purely on their assumptions about the measures’ strategic im- portance. Or they stress the measures that have become most fashionable in the business press or among consultants. Or, particularly when bonuses are at stake, they place greater weight on measures whose targets they know they can hit.
