# c. Charismatic Leadership

Charismatic leaders have a magnetic personality and the ability to influence and inspire through their charm and charisma. They often possess strong communication skills and a compelling presence that captivates their followers. Charismatic leaders can rally their teams behind a cause or vision and generate enthusiasm and commitment. However, it's important to note that charismatic leadership can have both positive and negative outcomes. While it can be highly effective in motivating teams, it may also lead to a dependency on the leader's charisma rather than fostering independent decision-making.
