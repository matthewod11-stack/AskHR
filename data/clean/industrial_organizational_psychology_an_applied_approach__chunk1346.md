## The Ethics of Tests of Normal Personality in Employee Selection

In this chapter your learned that personality testing

for selection purposes has become increasingly popular, particularly those which are given for normal personality. And, as with any other selection test (i.e., cognitive ability, physical agility), an applicant has no choice but to complete the test or otherwise risk not being considered for a position. So, applicants are asked to share a bit of who they are, rather than what they can do and how well they can do it.

and its destiny; You trust reason more than feelings; You feel involved when you watch TV soap operas. If these questions don’t pertain to the actual job a person will be doing, what business is it of a company to know that information? Supporters of the test will say: “It might show us whether a candidate is an introvert or extrovert.” But what right do employees have to know whether a candidate is an introvert or extrovert as long as the applicant can do the job well?

As long as these tests aren’t used to discriminate

against protected classes, they are not illegal to use in the selection process. But opponents of personality tests wonder just how ethical these tests are. First, the tests can be considered a violation of privacy: many of these tests ask questions about how a person feels or thinks about a particular concept or situation. For example: the online Jung Typology test (www. humanmetrics.com) asks a test taker to answer yes/no to such questions as: You often think about humankind

Second, just how well do these tests predict work performance in a particular job? That is, if your personality score shows you are low in creativity, is it saying that you will be a poor performer in a position that requires a certain level of creativity?

And, third, the results of some of these tests can be impacted by how the test taker is feeling that day. If the test taker is feeling sad or tired, how he/ she rates herself on a question that asks about how much they like to be around other people, may come

out different than how the test taker really feels or a normal day. So, rather than using these tests to make crucial hiring decisions based on tests results, critics believe they should only be used as icebreakers, as exercises in employee training programs, or for counseling purposes.

The testing industry is basically unregulated,

although there have been some attempts to introduce legislation preventing or at least better regulating these, as well as, any other employment tests. The Organization Association of Test Publishers continues to fight off such legislative challenges preventing the use of these tests for selection purposes. They contend, as do companies who use the tests, that using them, in conjunction with other selection methods, perfects the selection process just that much more. Interviews and other types of tests show the skill and knowledge of an applicant. Personality tests will show how well an applicant might fit into the organizational culture and get along with others, which is just as important as the applicant’s KSAOs. So, why shouldn’t the personality test be part of the selection process?
