# Summary

Few differences exist between sports participants and non-participants regarding the leadership skills measured in this study. Team participants differed significantly from non-participants in only two skills: teamwork and written communications. Sports team participants demonstrated higher teamwork skills. Those who did not participate in school sports demonstrated higher written communications skills. Increased levels of participation are not associated with differing levels of leadership skills. The nature of the sport is not generally associated with skill development.
