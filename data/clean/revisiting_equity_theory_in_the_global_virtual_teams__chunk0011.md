# 2.1 Foundations of equity theory

The ET (Adams, 1963) draws from the exchange, dissonance and social comparison concepts to predict how individuals manage their relationships with others. The theory proposes t hat due to the distress of either over

- reward or under -reward, inequitably rewarded individuals should

experience lower levels of job satisfaction than equitably rewarded individuals. ET hinges on the premise that individuals assess their outcome/input ratio and compare it to the ra tio of a “comparison other”. The theory assumes that individuals are equally sensitive to equity, which was dubbed the “norm of equity” – meaning that, when comparing the outcome/input ratios of the “comparison other”, if the outcome/input ratio of the individual is perceived to be unequa l with respect to the “comparison other”, a perception of inequity emerges. The greater the inequity the individual perceives (be it in the form of an over -reward or under -reward), the greater the individual’s distress.

- evaluations (SE) or self -inside, comprising the individual’s experience within their current organization; self -outside, that is, the individual’s experience with other organizations; others-inside, which derives from others within current organization; and others organization, such as perceptions anchored in individuals with the same educational leve l or age (Scholl et al., 1987).

The referent categories for comparison in ET are self

- outside, comprising others outside of the individual’s

Leventhal (1976) suggests three rules to judge equity in the comparison:

- 1. the “contribution” rule, which posits that rewards of others should be commensura te with the inputs;

- 2. the “needs” rule, which means that others should be regarded according to their own needs; and

- 3. the “equality” rule, irrespective of individual inputs.

The first one, the “contribution” rule, is dominant in management studies, and Huseman et a l. (1987) build on ET and Leventhal’s contribution rule to judge equity but posit that individuals are not equally sensitive to equity. In other words, not all individuals adhere to the “norm of equity”. Interestingly, the authors also question whether equity sensitivity is a state or a tr ait (which they seem to consider). They define input “I” and output “O”, both for self and the “comparison other”. The proposed Equity Sensitivity Construct recognizes that individuals have different preferences for equity and thus react differently to perceived equity and inequity. The re are three specific main groups:

- 1. Benevolents (which we also dub “givers” to the benefit of the discussion): those who pr efer their outcome/input ratios to be less than the outcome/input ratios of the “compari son other”; that is (O/I) < (O/I).

- 2. Equity Sensitives: those who conform to the traditional norm of equity and prefer that the outcome/input ratios be equal to those of the “comparison other”; that is (O/I) = (O/I). 3. Equity Sensitives: those who conform to the traditional norm of equity and prefer that the outcome/input ratios be equal to those of the “comparison other”; that is (O/I) = (O/I). ir

Our perceptions of our inputs and outcomes vis -à-vis those of others may be incorrect and such own inputs and be perceptions must be managed effectively. People tend to overestimate their oblivious to and thus underestimate the inputs of others. Moreover, the reactions to such misconceptions could depend on the type of person. For example, if a Benevolent (giver) feels their outputs are greater than their inputs, they may increase their effort to res
