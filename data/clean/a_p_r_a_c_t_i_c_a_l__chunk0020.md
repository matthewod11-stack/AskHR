Tools extend your agent’s capabilities by using APIs from underlying applications or systems. For legacy systems without APIs, agents can rely on computer-use models to interact directly with those applications and systems through web and application UIs—just as a human would(cid:20)

Each tool should have a standardized de(cid:12)nition, enabling 4exible, many-to-many relationships between tools and agents. Well-documented, thoroughly tested, and reusable tools improve discoverability, simplify version management, and prevent redundant de(cid:12)nitions(cid:20)

Broadly speaking, agents need three types of tools:
