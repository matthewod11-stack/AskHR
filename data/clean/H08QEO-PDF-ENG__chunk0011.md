# Why Motivation Dips and Boredom Grows

Collaboration with gen AI can remove the most cognitively demanding

parts of a task, often the aspects that make work stimulating and

requires critical thinking and tailored feedback. When gen AI generates

much of this content, the process becomes less engaging, and humans

may feel disconnected from the task. This sharp contrast becomes

evident when individuals return to solo work, leading to boredom and

diminished motivation.

In our study, we found that gen AI collaboration initially reduces

workers’ sense of control—the feeling of being the primary agent of

their work. Sense of control is a key component of intrinsic motivation:

When people feel that they are not fully in charge of the output, it

can undermine their connection to the task. However, we found that

transitioning back to solo work restores this sense of control, albeit at

the cost of enjoyment. Essentially, workers regain their autonomy but

feel less inspired and challenged.

These ﬁndings carry important implications for the future of work.

While gen AI can help organizations achieve short-term performance

gains, its overuse may have long-term consequences for workers’
