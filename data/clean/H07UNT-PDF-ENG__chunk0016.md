Further, PMs often become experts at delicately navigating the moods

of various stakeholders, another skill that enables them to properly

manage the expectations of the entire team.

“PMs become couples counselors, mediators, and therapists,” says

Hecht. “They need to make everyone feel valued and heard, explaining

what’s possible while clearly outlining the limitations. Clear is kind.”

To do this successfully, recap conversation takeaways in detail. For

example, the way a client digests a conversation can signiﬁcantly

vary from how a creative team digests it. An all-too-familiar scenario

happens when a client approves a creative concept, a team begins work

and comes back to present ideas to the client. The feedback isn’t great.

The PM needs to re-brief the team, set new deadlines, and present

again. Minds are changing, self doubt is creeping in, the PM is trying

to motivate employees as deadlines are shrinking.
