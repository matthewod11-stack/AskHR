coaches. 85% of the respondents acknowledged having not received a training on

coaching. They however did agree that coaching is part of the line managerâ€™s core

competencies and they should support and develop the coachees. The line

managers are receptive to the coaching practices and are raising awareness of

coaching within the workplace. These responses were captured in question 1A, 4A

and 9A and are illustrated in the figure 4.2.4 below.
