## of 713 managers of U.S. businesses by ResumeTemplates.com, a career

development hub, more than three-quarters of them reported that

compliance with attendance policies was a problem. Nearly half said

that employees weren’t coming in on designated days, and 40% said

employees were not staying for the full day.

“Hybrid” is a catchall term, of course, and the question of degree

matters. If a company institutes a “work from home on Fridays in the

summer” policy, which ﬁts the hybrid deﬁnition, working relationships are unlikely to suﬀer. But when employees individually choose which

days to work on-site, usually can’t sit near teammates, and bear no

consequences if they don’t come in, companies will encounter many of

the problems discussed above. The bottom line is that people just aren’t

in the oﬃce together enough—and companies are doing little to reverse

that or to adapt their management practices to suit the new reality.
