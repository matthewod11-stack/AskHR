# central place in microeconomics.

Herbert Simon was a towering figure in the development of behavioral economics. Simon coined the

terms “bounded rationality” and “procedural rationality” and sowed the seeds for the analyses of rationality

bounds that are the substance of this paper. Despite the influence of Simon’s language, he had in mind a style

of theorizing that has not caught on in economics. Influenced by cognitive science and the information

processing model of human decision making, Simon thought good theories might take the form of algorithms

which describe the procedures that people and firms use.

The economist in modern times who carries Simon’s methodological torch is Ariel Rubinstein (e.g., see

his 1998 book). Rubinstein’s models are often stylized to a particular economic application and describe the

mathematical result of particular algorithms which embody rationality limits. While these models are widely-

known, in many cases they have not led to a sustained program of research, as his seminal work on bargaining

has. Rubinstein’s frustration with inattention to models driven by similarity judgment, a central concept in

psychology, is evident in his 2003 discussion of models of time preference.
