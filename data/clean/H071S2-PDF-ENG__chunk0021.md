# Appreciate progress.

When you start noticing movement in the right direction, show

appreciation for each step forward. You may feel concerned that giving

positive feedback too quickly when they haven’t done everything yet

will cause them to slack oﬀ. But the opposite is usually true. Positive

feedback helps to build their conﬁdence, positivity, and motivation and

can propel them toward better and better outcomes.

Your direct report likely knows they have really bad time management

and may feel worse about it than you do. Laying into them is

counterproductive; increased negative emotions about their work

usually causes more delays, not less. Remember that you’re on the same

team. Instead of tearing them down, build them up each step of the way.

Get outside support.

Sometimes you’re too close to a situation. No matter how hard you try,

you can’t provide objective, calm feedback. Or your direct report may

not be able to be honest with you about what’s truly going on, such as

wasting hours each day scrolling on their phone or a situation at home

that may be distracting them.
