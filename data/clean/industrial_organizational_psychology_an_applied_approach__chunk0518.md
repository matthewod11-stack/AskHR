## Methods Providing Information About Competencies

Occupational Information Network. Th e Occupational Information Network (O*NET) is a national job analysis system created by the federal government to replace the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) which had been in use since the s (Peterson et al., ). O*NET is a major advancement in understanding the nature of work, in large part because its developers understood that jobs can be viewed at four levels: economic, organizational, occupational, and individual. As a result, O*NET has incorporated the types of information obtained in many job analysis techniques. A chart comparing O*NET with other job analysis methods is located on this text’s webpage.
