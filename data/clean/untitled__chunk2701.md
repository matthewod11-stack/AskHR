# 492 Ethnic Minorities

Fortunately, one of our members, Pat Okura, was execu- tive assistant to the director of NIMH, Bertram Brown. Pat gave us very valuable suggestions and help.

However, there are several considerations that had a signiﬁ- cant effect on our growth and effectiveness:

- Research. There was little information and knowledge about Asian Americans. No large-scale epidemiological studies of theprevalence of mentaldisorders hadever been conducted. It was not until the mid-1990s that funding been received from NIMH to conduct the ﬁrst large-scale study of the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders in anAsianAmerican population (the study was conducted by the National Research Center on Asian American Mental Health). Funding for such research was difﬁcult because of the popular belief that Asian Americans were well adjusted and relatively free of mental disorders and such studies were unnecessary—a belief we had to combat.

- 1. A small, dedicated, and persistent group can accomplish much. While we initially spent a great deal of time trying to increase membership in AAPA, it was clear that a few dedicated members would have to do most of the work in communicating with members, writing the newsletter, and advocating the interests of Asian Americans to national organizations and funding agen- cies, and so on. Time was also spent deciding courses of action when members had grievances (complaints about racial discrimination, documenting instances of stereo- types, etc.), sought advice (e.g., about submitting manu- scripts for publications), and made requests of one kind or another.

- Practice. We felt that mental health services were not adequate to meet the needs of Asian Americans. Widely documented was the severe lack of utilization of mental health services on the part of Asian Americans. AAPA tried to encourage the development of more culturally- responsive services to Asian Americans and strategies to increase utilization.

- Training. There were very few Asian Americans in psy- chology, and we needed a critical mass of individuals to achieve our goals.AAPAhelped to sponsor a 1976 training conference funded by NIMH to make recommendations for the training of students for future roles in research, teaching, and practice with Asian Americans.

- Networking. Also important to AAPA was networking— providing opportunities for Asian Americans to meet and collaborate.

Because the achievements of AAPAand its members have been distributed over a 30-year period, it is sometimes difﬁcult to draw lessons from our organizational efforts.

- 2. Alliances must be made with members of other ethnic groups, Whites, key leaders, and organizations.

- 3. The inﬂuence of a small, dedicated, and persistent group cannot be underestimated. We had many instances of having a few individuals taking initiative and succeeding. 4. Those who become involved in ethnic issues must realize that such issues are unlike those typically found in psy- chology. Ethnic issues can become very emotional and personal, as well as intellectual. You can be subjected to personal attacks involving whether actions help or hurt the ethnic community. On other hand, work on Asian Americans can be gratifying, not only professionally but also personally. Happily, AAPA is ready to celebrate its 30th anniversary. It includes the involvement of hundreds of psychologists and psychology students. It has an annual convention, a news- letter, and an Internet listserve for members to communicate with each other. Many of us feel a tremendous sense of pride over AAPA’s accomplishments over the years.
