But how, exactly, can you prove to negotiating partners that you’re

paying this level of attention to their logic, emotions, perspective,

and, ultimately, wants and needs so that they begin to see you as

a collaborator rather than an adversary? In my world we use the

mnemonic MORE PIES to remember the techniques for both ensuring

and demonstrating level-ﬁve listening. This is not a box-ticking exercise

but a way to train your focus so that you’re better able to understand and

empathize with your counterpart.
