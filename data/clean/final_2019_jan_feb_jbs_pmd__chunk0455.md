have significant impact on group performance. Group Performance can be improved if changes are made in the demographic factors. Better education is positively linked to Group Performance and groups consisting of members with better education shows better mean performance. Caste and age are also seem to show correlations to Group Performance. The results suggests that there are factors which if intervened by the authorities significantly contributes positivel y to Group Performance.Among such factors, education with emphasis on skill enhancement and a good orientation to members on income generation with respect to opportunities available can be two prime

areas of focus which can yield positive results in group performance. The study revealed that the group while homogeneity is critical it is found that homogeneity doesn’t help if the group members are all less educated. In such cases a mix of members in terms of education can be included. It is also observed that many a time caste becomes a criterion for group formation which should not be the case as socially backward castes need some handholding which can be done from the members of other castes who are better off. Thus right interventions in terms of sk ill training and group constitution can positively impact the performance.
