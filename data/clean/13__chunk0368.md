performance will not fully capture the extent to which past performance can predict future performance.

The non-linear trends of job performance will cause the above model to be under speciﬁed in a way that could affect the interpretation of the independent variables of interest. That is, although lagged performance may be in the model, this coefﬁcient does not partial out all of the effects associated with past performance. The potential for this problem can be seen by comparing the results of Harrison et al. (1996) and Sturman and Trevor (2001). In their studies of turnover, both papers showed that changes in performance were associated with the probability of turnover. However, Sturman and Trevor (2001) extended the work by Harrison et al. (1996) by demonstrating that even after controlling for the most recent change in turnover, long-term trends of performance also affected the probability of in another study of turnover that controlled turnover. Hypothetically, only for the most recent change in performance, is possible that some independent variable under investigation would be correlated with these performance trends. If so, the variable may falsely appear to relate to the dependent variable because the effects of the long-term trends were not controlled for in the model.
