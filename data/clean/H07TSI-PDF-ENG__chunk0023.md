## HBR / Digital Article / Does Your Hybrid Strategy Need to Change?

Companies like Cisco and Dropbox are redesigning their oﬃce space

to make it more amenable to collaboration. Such moves are consistent

with their respective work model policies, which enable employees to do

focus work remotely and encourage employees to come together for key

events such as all-hands meetings. As Cisco’s CEO Chuck Robbins put it, in today’s world you have to oﬀer a compelling “return on commute” to

get your employees bought into coming into the oﬃce.

Redesigned work models also need to consider the ways in which we

communicate. For example, we worked with Verizon to improve the

way they run meetings, such as scheduling 25- or 50-minute meetings

with a 5- or 10-minute lagged start time to give people breathing room.

We also identiﬁed meetings that could be replaced by asynchronous modes of work (such as email, chat, shared documents, or oﬄine

review) and clariﬁed what “required” and “optional” meant. In our experiments, 90% of participants reported overall meeting eﬀectiveness

had improved and 78% felt they wasted less time sitting in meetings

where their live participation wasn’t required.

Leaders will also need to monitor the impact of new technologies

that they introduce. The generative AI experiment mentioned above

also revealed that overreliance on generative AI can lead to a loss of

collective diversity of ideas. As leaders seek to beneﬁt from the value

creation opportunities of generative AI, they’ll need to consider where and how people collaborate most eﬀectively to ensure they retain their
