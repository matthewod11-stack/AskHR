## HBR / Magazine Article / Safety Should Be a Performance Driver

had a $1,000 annual budget earmarked for recognizing employees’

safety behaviors at events or employee town halls. It’s important to

note that the incentives focused on behaviors that prevent accidents;

punitive responses to accidents don’t help prevent them. Regular

audits were conducted to verify compliance with sharp-tools coverage

and handling protocols. High-performing sites were spotlighted in

newsletters and town halls, and their best practices were widely shared.

Managers also worked with local teams to set realistic incremental

targets, and they steadily raised the bar over time.

The VP of marketing developed a communications plan to recognize

and promote the company’s strong safety performance to both internal

and external stakeholders. That increased site managers’ satisfaction

and further diﬀerentiated the service among corporate customers.

Safety is now a key selling point in new-client proposals, and over the

course of a year and a half, sales increased by 24%.

. . .

It’s imperative that we fundamentally rethink the entrenched view

of safety. By reimagining it for the 21st century, not as a defensive

necessity but as an oﬀensive opportunity, companies can elevate safety

from a siloed function to a shared mindset, from a cost center to a

value accelerator. The task of improving safety while delivering value

for customers, employees, and shareholders is one that executives

need to embrace, but they must do so mindfully, systematically, and

consistently. Then safety can become a formidable strategic advantage.
