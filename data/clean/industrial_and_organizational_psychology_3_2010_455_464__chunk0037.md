thoughtful approach to integrating JDM materials into an IOOB-focused graduate- level seminar. In addition, Reb (2010) suggests that interdisciplinary collaboration could help overcome the signiﬁcant bar- rier of having to be an expert in several disciplines. He notes that academic and other research institutions typically tout the importance of interdisciplinary research but do little to actually facilitate such research. We agree wholeheartedly. In fact, some of the authors of this article have observed that, although interdisciplinary work is ofﬁ- cially encouraged at their academic insti- tutions, the administration of expenses and revenues, and the way these moneys are shared across departments, has hindered the institutionalization of interdisciplinary research groups. At the level of the two disciplines of IOOB and JDM, opportuni- ties for institutionalizing cross-fertilization to implement. The are perhaps easier ideas in the commentaries included spe- cial issues in journals, special sessions at conferences, special funding for interdisci- plinary work focused on practical problems, and other interdisciplinary endeavors (Con- nolly, 2010; Reb, 2010).

Finally, Connolly (2010) suggests that it is important to systematically examine the ‘‘mundane factors’’ that steer researchers toward ‘‘conservative persistence’’ within a particular academic discipline despite evidence of the ‘‘intellectual and practical importance’’ of cross-fertilization. Ideally, the outcome of such an examination would be additional ideas to incentivize, or at least avoid disincentivizing, cross-fertilization.

these excellent sug- gestions, if embraced by those within the IOOB and JDM communities, will surely spur more interdisciplinary work and begin the institutionalizationof cross-fertilization. As Whyte (2010) notes, it would be ‘‘unfor- tunate ... if young IOOB researchers were to ignore the opportunities presented by JDM to push IOOB in a direction that it might not otherwise go and to unlock important insights that might otherwise remain hidden.’’ IOOB, likewise, has much to contribute to JDM. Sustained openness
