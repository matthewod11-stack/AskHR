## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

achieved alone. To do great things, we rely on teammates. And to win,

team leaders must ﬁnd ways to draw the best physical, mental, and

emotional performance from the players working with them.

Since retiring from football, Tom has been reﬂecting on what he brought

to the teams he played on. Naturally, most people focus on his role as

a quarterback. But we believe that another set of behaviors—how he

helped the people around him perform better—was a vital part of why

those teams won so much.

As part of Tom’s exploration of this topic, he reached out to Nitin, who

has been studying and teaching leadership for nearly four decades.

He’s also a football fan—a Patriots season ticket holder—who has

followed Tom’s career closely. Together, we began to sort through Tom’s

experiences to identify the leadership principles that people can use to

maximize performance from their teammates.

In this article, we’ve distilled this work into a set of seven behaviors.

We’ve written the rest of the piece in Tom’s voice because these ideas

are based on his experiences, but what follows is a collaborative eﬀort.

Although Tom’s experiences took place mostly in sports, we believe that

many of the techniques he used can be applied in any organization.
