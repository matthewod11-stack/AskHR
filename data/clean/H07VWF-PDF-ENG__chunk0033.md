## For dads without access to parental leave.

Not many employers in the U.S. provide paid paternity leave. If you

don’t have access to paid leave and cannot aﬀord unpaid leave, you can

still train your brain by ﬁnding baby-engagement time outside of work.

To maximize brain training, one-on-one time needs to be a priority

during your baby’s infancy, so make the time to be alone with your

baby. Will you be exhausted? Absolutely. Is it going to be worth it? 100%.

Of course, if your partner is breastfeeding, the role of feeding the

baby may be covered. But there are still plenty of other baby-focused

roles you can take on: diaper duty, gas-bubble eradicator, tummy-time

instructor, master soother, nap captain, expert swaddler, lullaby singer,

scrubber and bather — or just strap on a baby carrier and head out for a

walk. You don’t have to read your infant Proust; you don’t have to strive

for perfection. You just have to spend time with them.
