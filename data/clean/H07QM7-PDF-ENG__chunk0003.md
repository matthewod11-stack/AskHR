Trust is one of the most essential forms of capital a leader can have.

When employees trust their leaders, it unleashes higher performance.

Employees are more engaged, productive, and innovative. They

experience lower levels of stress and burnout and are more likely to stay

in their jobs. Good leaders understand these beneﬁts and actively work

to earn and develop the trust of their team members and colleagues.
