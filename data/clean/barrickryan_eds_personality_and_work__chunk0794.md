# Accuracy of Fit Perceptions

Fiona was delighted with the offer from Acme Corporation. Of all the places she interviewed at, this was the one she really resonated with, where she thought she would ﬁt best. The people she had met, as well as the organization’s literature, conveyed a sense of sophisticated, worldly, witty people—just what Fiona longed to be.

After just a short time on the job, however, Fiona was surprised at how misguided her thinking had been. She hardly got a word in at meet- ings because she was less assertive than her colleagues, so her boss felt she was “not contributing much.” She found the wittiness translated into an ofﬁce where barbs and snipes were used as put-downs. Her lack of experience and frugal lifestyle left her with little to contribute to nonwork discussions about travel abroad and the hottest restaurant in town. How could she have so misjudged her ﬁt with this workplace?

This scenario raises the question, “How accurate are people’s ﬁt self-assessments?” Given that relationships have been found be- tween PO ﬁt perceptions and outcomes (turnover, job offer ac- ceptance), it seems plausible to argue that perceptions are at least somewhat accurate. However, studies comparing subjective ﬁt to objective or actual ﬁt indicate a relatively low correlation (Cable & Judge, 1997; Kristof-Brown & Stevens, 2001). Some have argued that ﬁt perceptions are often inaccurate (Cable, Aiman-Smith, Mul- vey, & Edwards, 2000; Saks & Ashforth, 1997), particularly when in- dividuals have little information on which to form impressions (job seekers early in the search process).

We would argue that the distinction between complementary and supplementary ﬁt might be important to understanding the ac- curacy of self-perceptions. Supplementary ﬁt perceptions based on personality may often be inaccurate. Job seekers may lack “organiza- tion personality” information. Web sites, brochures, and recruiting
