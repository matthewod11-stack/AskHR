# love, kindness, trust, or security.

In the purpose-deﬁning stage of strategy projects, we conduct belief

audits to get input from many stakeholders. Do the same. Ask friends or

family members what your strengths are, what values you live by, what

things excite you, and what need you might help ﬁll.

Draw from your own answers and theirs to draft a purpose statement,

and then ask for feedback on it. Or you can engage ChatGPT in an

interactive dance, using the answers to the four questions as input to

help you develop your purpose statement, as Tom, a climate physicist,

did in one of our recent workshops.

When Joudi, a Kurdish refugee from Syria currently living in Germany,

went through this exercise, he identiﬁed his core strengths as ambition,

passion, and hunger for knowledge. His core values were justice,

peace, family, and charity. He said he was most excited by innovation,

neurosurgery, and entrepreneurship (notably his experiences selling

accessories as a street vendor in Istanbul and founding a multilingual

AI-powered integration support platform for Ukrainians who had ﬂed

their country for Germany). As for the world needs he wanted to

address, Joudi cited health care, freedom, and equality. In the end, he

wrote this purpose statement: “Remain medically passionate, willing to

learn, entrepreneurial, and strong-willed to drive medical innovation

and create equitable access to health care for people.”
