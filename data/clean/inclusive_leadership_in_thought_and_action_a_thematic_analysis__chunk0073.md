promoting inclusion may be effective for understanding the breadth of in- clusive leadership and the range of effects on employee inclusion experiences. Future research could also beneﬁt from an examination of outcomes of the inclusive leadership behaviors identiﬁed in this study. As prior research suggests that leader inclusiveness enhances psychological safety and work engagement (Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006; Choi, Tran, & Park, 2015), studies for exploring the degree to which behaviors highlighted here for inviting and appreciating others’ perspectives and skills, even when they diverge from established norms or are in conﬂict with established views, and leveraging and enhancing employee contributions may advance our un- derstanding of the inﬂuence of inclusive leadership. Based on research that shows leader openness to, and respect for, new ideas and feedback facilitates a supportive climate in which employees feel comfortable experimenting and offering alternative perspectives (Choi et al., 2015, Choi, Tran, & Kang, 2017; Javed et al., 2017; Qi, Liu, Wei, & Hu, 2019), studies to investigate the relationship between inclusive leadership behaviors and employee creativity and innovation would help us to further understand its impact. As feelings of psychological safety resultingfrom leader inclusiveness have also been shown to inﬂuence employee learning from errors and failures (Hirak, Peng, Carmeli, & Schaubroeck, 2012; Ye, Wang, & Li, 2018), research to observe associ- ations between speciﬁc inclusive leadership behaviors and various perfor- mance measures may be useful for highlighting how this approach affects group and organizational functioning.
