incomplete. Similarly, theories of inclusive leadership that focus primarily on preventing negative interactions such as bias and discrimination are also incomplete in that preventing intergroup tensions alone is insufﬁcient for promoting positive outcomes because workgroups will only engage in the elaboration and integration of diverse information if they are motivated to do so (van Knippenberg & van Ginkel, pp. 779–797).

Thus, inclusive team leadership has to do with how leaders: (a) proactively shape their workgroup’s understanding of their diversity and establish shared mental maps, norms, and social connections that enable them to effectively leverage their diversity for knowledge creation while also minimizing in- tergroup tensions (Figure 1, link 2a) and (b) react to group processes once they have been activated (Figure 1, link 2b). We describe each in turn below.

Inclusive Leadership as a Moderator of First-Stage Relationships at the Workgroup-Level (Figure 1, link 2a)

Research on diversity has established that demographic dissimilarity is often associated with lower-levels of social integration and psychological attach- ment (O’Reilly, Caldwell & Barnett, 1989; Tsui, Egan & O’Reilly, 1992). The more workgroup members identify with their workgroup as a whole, the less likely it is for subgroup identiﬁcation to negatively impact group processes (Huo, 2003). There are two broad categories of inclusive leadership behaviors needed to counteract these tendencies whilst also motivating the workgroup to interact in ways that enable them to leverage workgroup diversity for syn- ergistic performance outcomes. The ﬁrst broad category is more task-focused and involves developing shared cognition about the what and how of the group’s work, and the second, more person-focused category involves pro- moting strong social connections (particularly across difference).

Often, teams jump right into taskwork without taking time to develop a shared understanding of how they will manage their teamwork, where the latter has to do with how group members work together (e.g., decision- making, conﬂict resolution, coordinating action, roles and responsibilities; Marks et al., 2001). The latter is essential, however, for helping group members develop transactive memory and internalize shared mental models for group functioning, which in turn facilitate collective identity and provide a basis for group cohesion, collaboration, and superior performance (Kozlowski & Bell, 2013; Salas & Fiore, 2004; Sivunen, 2006). This is especially true in diverse groups.
