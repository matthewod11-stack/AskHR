At the end of the twentieth century, a new pattern of sci- entiÔ¨Åc and professional organizations had emerged. Increas- ing specialization of knowledge led to the rapid growth of many specialty societies. For an example, the reader is en- couraged to visit the World Wide Web site of the Federation of Psychological, Behavioral, and Cognitive Societies (www.thefederationonline.org). The federation comprises 19 different societies ranging in size from the very large APA to the very small Society of Judgement and Decision-Making. As these specialty societies proliferate, many psychologists have chosen to belong to only their specialty group rather than to a larger association such as the APAor American Psy- chological Society that represents a broader, more inclusive view of psychology as both science and profession. A poten- tial problem with this increased specialization is the further fractionation of organized psychology (Fowler, 1992). It is possible that such fractionation will weaken the authority of psychology and psychologists in the larger society. But, that, perhaps, will be the subject for some future history of professional organizations.
