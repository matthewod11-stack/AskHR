# Psychological Tests

An employment test may be illegal if its questions unnecessarily invade the pri- vacy of an applicant. At most risk are psychological tests originally developed to measure psychopathology. These tests often include questions about such top- ics as religion and sexual preference that some applicants feel uncomfortable answering. In Soroka v. Dayton Hudson (), three applicants for store security guard positions with Target Stores filed a class action suit after taking a -item psychological test (Psychscreen). The applicants believed some of the questions, a few of which are shown in Table ., violated their right to privacy guaranteed by the California constitution.
