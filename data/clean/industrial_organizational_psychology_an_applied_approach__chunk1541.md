# Thomas A. Edison’s Employment Test

a sliding band, however, we start with the highest score (Kilborne at ) and sub- tract from it the bandwidth (.). In this case,  − . = ., meaning that all applicants scoring between  and  are considered statistically to have the same score. Because no female falls within this band, we hire Kilborne and then con- sider the next score of Letterman at . Our next band of  through  ( − .) still does not contain a female, so we hire Letterman and then consider the next score of King at . Our new band of  to  contains four applicants, one of whom is a woman. Because we are free to hire anyone within a band, we would probably hire Winfrey to meet our affirmative action goals. We would then hire King as our fourth person. With banding, one more woman was hired than would have occurred under a top-down system. Note, however, that our goal to hire two women was not reached, as it was when we used passing scores. To practice how to construct a band, complete Exercise . in your workbook.

Though the concept of banding has been approved in several court cases (Bridgeport Guardians v. City of Bridgeport, ; Chicago Firefighters Union Local No.  v. City of Chicago, ; Officers for Justice v. Civil Service Commis- sion, ), only selecting minorities in a band would be illegal. Instead, affirma- tive action goals must be considered as only one factor in selecting applicants from a band. For example, by allowing some flexibility in hiring, the use of band- ing might allow a police chief to hire a lower-scoring Spanish-speaking applicant or an applicant with computer skills over a higher-scoring applicant without these desired, but not required skills.

Though banding seems to be a good compromise between top-down hiring and passing scores (Zedeck, Cascio, Goldstein, & Outtz, ), it is not without its critics (Campion et al., ). Research indicates that banding can result in lower utility than top-down hiring (Schmidt, ), that it may not actually reduce adverse impact in any significant way (Gutman & Christiansen, ), and that its usefulness in achieving affirmative action goals is affected by such factors as the selection ratio and the percentage of minority applicants (Sackett & Roth, ).
