# Applied Case Study

In Chapter 1, we mentioned

that in 1920, inventor Thomas Edison created a 150-item test that he used to hire managers and scientists. All applicants were given two hours to answer a basic set of questions covering geography, science, history, and literature, and then, depending on the position applied for, some questions specific to their field. Edison created the test because he wanted to hire the best employees and he didn’t trust college graduates. This distrust can be seen in his

quote, “Men who have gone to college I find to be amazingly ignorant. They don’t seem to know anything.”

To pass the test, an applicant had to get 90% of the questions correct, a score thought to be comparable to an IQ of 180 (although there is no proof of this). According to Edison, of the first 718 male college graduates who took the test (there were no female applicants), only 57 (7.9%) had a grade of at least 70% (a passing score in college)

and only 32 (4.5%) scored above 90%, Edison’s passing score to be considered “Class A” men. What were some of the questions? What countries bound France?

Where is the finest cotton grown?

What city in the United States leads in making laundry machines?

What has the greater area, Greenland or Australia?

As you can imagine, the

test was not popular with applicants. Edison scored the test himself and, not only did he not share the test scores with the applicants, he had a rule that forbade applicants from communicating the questions to others. At least two applicants leaked the test results to the media, and on May 11, 1929, the New York Times published 141 of the questions that one of the unsuccessful applicants, Charles Hansen, could remember (you have to be pretty bright to remember 141 questions verbatim!).The media challenged Edison by giving him pop quizzes similar to the one he created. He averaged 95% on these pop quizzes! Interestingly, Edison’s son, Theodore, didn’t pass the test although he had a bachelor’s degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
