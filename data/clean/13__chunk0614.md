problems stemming from intergroup contact (Fiske & Ruscher, 1993; Vanman & Miller, 1993).

Increased contact with outgroup Increased Contact with Outgroup Members. members may lead to a reduction in the degree to which cognitions about them are stereotype-based. However, for increased contact to prove functional in changing observers’ views, the contact must be positive (Brewer & Miller, 1988; Hewstone, 1996). In addition, it must result in the decategorization (more speciﬁcally, the personalization) of outgroup members.

Changing Observers’ Emotional Reactions. As noted above, emotional reactions to members of many stigmatized outgroups are often automatic and appear to result from processes that have survival value in a society (Kurzban & Leary, 2001; Zajonc, 1980). As a result, they may be highly resistant to change. Nevertheless, some research suggests that negative affective reactions to outgroup members can be attenuated through increased contact (e.g., Bornstein, 1993). However, other research shows that increased contact results in more negative emotional responses (e.g., Vanman & Miller, 1993).
