## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

Mithun Biswas was excited about the zoom meeting at 3:00 PM on June 5, 2023. He had

joined Kharagpur branch of MyBank recently as a sales executive and it was his first sales

meeting in the new organization. However, other members of his team did not demonstrate

the same enthusiasm. He was visibly miffed about his colleaguesâ€™ lukewarm response towards

the schedule of the sales meeting through video conference which was likely to be addressed

by Regional Sales Head of Eastern Region of the bank based in Kolkata. In the previous

organization, Mithun had received sales executive of the year award for three consecutive

years. He never felt the heat of such sales meetings. Rather he would always look forward to

sales meetings as forums to showcase his accomplishments and take up challenging targets.

So, when the mood in his office became sombre after announcement of the meeting, he was

baffled.

Lalit Ghosh, Priya Majumder, Rohan Bose, and Raju Dastidar were busy preparing their

reports and framing their responses for the 3:00 PM meeting since morning. They had joined

the Kharagpur branch of MyBank during past couple of years. They were aware of the

temperament of Gautam Sarkar who had joined MyBank as Regional Sales Head in Kolkata

office about six months ago. He was a man in a hurry. He would lose his cool at the drop of

the hat. Moreover, he would become furious if anyone missed the sales targets hardly

appreciate those who were able to bring in business as per the set goals. He considered that

the sales executive did not work at all if he/she simply achieved the sales target. According to

Gautam, sales targets were restraining many sales executives to take initiatives to exceed the

desired numbers. Hence, he would spare none in the sales meetings.

The sales meeting commenced exactly at 3:00 PM. There were over 30 sales executives from

different branches of MyBank in Paschim Mednipur district of West Bengal. Kharagpur branch

was the largest in Paschim Mednipur district in terms of number of savings as well as current

accounts, quantum of deposits, disbursal of loans, etc. However, Gautam was never satisfied

with the sales team of Kharagpur branch. He was a bit lenient towards the sales executives

deployed in Salboni, Ghata, Belda, Chandrakona, Ramjibanpur, Garbeta, Balichak, Dantan,
