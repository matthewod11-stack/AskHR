## compensation professionals at a 2023 sales incentive conference and

learned that 83% struggled to prevent salespeople from cheating.

Of course, companies shouldn’t avoid incentive programs altogether,

despite their inherent risk. Well-designed programs can improve

seller performance and increase revenue. But managers should learn

everything they can about how their incentive programs are being

used—and abused—by employees. In this article, we draw on our

interviews—along with our combined experience researching sales

compensation and leading sales incentive plans for large banking,

software, consulting, and computer hardware ﬁrms—to oﬀer an

inventory of tactics salespeople commonly use and provide a framework

for addressing sales incentive exploitation, including whether, in some

cases, it should be tolerated.
