# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

likely to be true for members of historically marginalized identity groups who have internalized the risks associated with being subjected to negative stereotypes about their competence and perceived as deviant from role ex- pectations (Cha et al., 2019; Eagly & Karau, 2002; Heilman, 2012). This is evident in research which has found that the relationship between diversity climate and psychological safety is stronger for minorities (Singh, Winkel & Selvarajan, 2013), suggesting that it is easier for majority group members to experience psychological safety because organizational life is built around dominant narratives.

To counteract this pattern, leaders need to actively invite input from minoritized workgroup members, and more importantly, role model listening to and afÔ¨Årming rather than dismissing voiced perspectives. Furthermore, when leaders invest in direct dialogue with followers about their ideas, in- cluding to understand the identity-related experiences that have shaped those insights, they enable felt identify freedom (i.e., that their uniqueness is valued; Chrobot-Mason & Aramovitch, 2013). The more followers see themselves in work-related decision-making, the greater their sense of psychological em- powerment and likelihood they will identify with the workgroup.
