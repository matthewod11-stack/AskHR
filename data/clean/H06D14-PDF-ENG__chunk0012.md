## with your manager, both directly and indirectly.

Discuss challenges. “The last thing your boss wants to do is mediate

a relationship between you and your coworker,” says White. And yet,

your boss has a vested interest in your ability to do your job, particularly

if something or someone is getting in the way. Frame the conversation

with that in mind, says White. She recommends saying something along

the lines of, “I’m not able to do my best work because during the day I

ﬁnd myself checking up on things outside [my purview] that distract

me from my assignments.” White cautions against mentioning your

colleague by name. “Make it about you and your work.”

Request joint feedback. If you and this problem individual are involved

in projects that are tightly integrated and being evaluated on your

joint output, “you should ask your boss if the two of you could receive

performance feedback at the same time,” says Uzzi. During the feedback

session, “your boss will ask probing questions about the project, and it

will become obvious who dropped the ball,” he says. Then, assuming

your colleague cares about their job, you’ll have some leverage to

suggest changes. “You can say, ‘The boss is right; we can do better. I

have ideas of how we can improve next time,’” Uzzi says. He predicts

your colleague will be grateful. “The other person will be looking for

solutions that take the pressure oﬀ.”

Seek out different ways to shine. You also need to look for ways

to “reduce your interdependence” on this questionable colleague,
