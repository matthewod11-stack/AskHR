As Predictive analytics is considered as the highest level of PA, and Data Science is one of

building block for an analyst in PA ,we discuss the use of algorithm and demonstrate one of

the most popular PA analytics matter: to predict the turnover for Workforce planning

Kumar (2016) define predictive modelling as a collection of statistical algorithms implemented

within a statistical tool. When applied to historical data, these algorithms generate a

mathematical function or equation. Subsequently, this function can be employed to anticipate

future outcomes based on specific inputs, with the aim of achieving business goals or

facilitating improved decision-making in a broader context.. The array of available algorithms

for predictive modelling encompasses Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Clustering,
