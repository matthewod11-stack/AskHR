# Relatively Structured Formats

However rich the information obtainable from unstructured interviews, and despite the ﬂexibility of an unstructured ap- proach in adapting to unpredictable variations in how inter- vieweesmaypresentthemselves,theseformatslacksufﬁciently standardized procedures to ensure replicable and reliable data collection. Mounting concerns that the unreliability of diag- nostic interviews in clinical settings were impeding mental health research led in the 1970s to the development of the ResearchDiagnosticCriteria(RDC),whichcomprisedasetof clearly speciﬁed descriptive behavioral criteria for assigning participants in research studies to one of several diagnostic categories (Spitzer, Endicott, & Robins, 1978). This descrip- tive behavioral approach noticeably improved the interrater reliability achieved by diagnostic interviewers, and the RDC format, including many of its speciﬁc criteria, was subse- quently incorporated into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of theAmerican PsychiatricAssociations, be- ginning with DSM-II in 1980 and extending to the present DSM-IV-TR (American PsychiatricAssociation, 2000).

The RDC criteria also lent themselves well to formulating questions to be asked in diagnostic interviews, and they soon gave rise to a new genre of assessment methods, a relatively structured interview that consists entirely or in large part of speciﬁc items of inquiry. Simultaneously with the publication of the RDC criteria, Endicott and Spitzer (1978) introduced the best known and most frequently used instrument of this

kind, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS). Intended to assist in identifying a broad range of symptomatic disorders in addition to affective disorders and schizophrenia, the SADS is a semistructured interview guide that requires professional judgment and serves clinical as well as research purposes. Following on its heels came the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), which is entirely struc- tured and was designed for use by nonprofessional interview- ers in research studies (Robins, Helzer, Croughan, & Ratcliff, 1981). Both of these measures were extended downward for use with young people, as the Kiddie SADS (K-SADS; Puig- Antich & Chambers, 1978) and the Diagnostic Interview for Children (DISC; Costello, Edelbrock, & Costello, 1985). The most comprehensive measure of this kind to emerge has been the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (SCID), which includes forms for identifying personality as well as sympto- matic disorders (Spitzer, Williams, & Gibbon, 1987; see also R. Rogers, 2001).
