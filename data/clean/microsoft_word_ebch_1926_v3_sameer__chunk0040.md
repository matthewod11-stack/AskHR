- 4. McClelland's Need Achievement Theory

According to McClelland's need-to-achieve theory, some individuals are motivated to succeed by a desire for "personal achievement rather than rewards themselves". This idea, which is easily adaptable to academic settings, explains why some instructors, despite the challenges they face, are high achievers: they set high objectives for themselves, and achieving these goals is what motivates them.

- 5. The equity theory

Process theories describe "how" satisfaction occurs as opposed to "what" motivates people. According to the equity principle, workers will measure their contributions to a job against the results they get in return; the bigger the rewards, the more satisfied they are. This is consistent with Naveed et al.'s definition of job satisfaction as the gap between employee input and job output. According to this notion, employees would feel satisfied with their jobs if they believe they get more in return for their efforts than what they put into them. The job itself can have some effects on how an employee views it. Clarified tasks result in higher job satisfaction since a motivated workforce that is dedicated to their work and actively participates in it is produced. The authors identified five key job characteristics, including the range of skills required for a task, its identity and importance, autonomy, and feedback that have an impact on an employee's psychological state and affect their motivation and job satisfaction as well as their levels of absenteeism. Employees compare their input-outcome ratio with that of other employees and if they feel it to be fair, employees will experience pleasure. Employees become unhappy and less motivated if they believe that their input-output ratio is unfair when compared to that of other employees[9], [10].

- 6. Value-Percept Theory

Because employees in different organizations have diverse value systems, according to this hypothesis, people's degrees of job satisfaction will likewise vary depending on their personal values. According to the Value-Percept theory (Anderson, Ones, Sinangil&Viswesvaran, depending on how important the job is to the individual, the discrepancy between expectations and what is received might lead to dissatisfaction. This idea could have a problem because there can be a connection between what individuals want and what they value highly.

- 7. Vroom's Expectancy Theory

According to Vrooms' expectancy theory, behavior is a result of choices that can be given priority. The goal is to increase employee happiness and decrease employee dissatisfaction. Performance is influenced by human characteristics including personality and aptitude (Wagner and Oldenburg. This theory also illustrates how factors like valence, instrumentality, and anticipation may be used to demonstrate how performance, motivation, and effort are all related to an individual's motivation. Higher performance is correlated with greater effort put forth at work.

- 8. Porter-Lawler Model

This is a more thorough and full explanation of motivation that takes into account a variety of factors. The fiber relationship between job performance and attitudes, which completely describes managers, may be described in depth by this model. The assumptions underlying
