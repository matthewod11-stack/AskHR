## HBR / Magazine Article / Negotiate Like a Pro

Over several weeks he and I sit side-by-side in a corporate oﬃce, 16

hours a day, with a mobile phone in front of us on the table. Of course,

we take breaks to sleep and eat, especially when we’re not expecting a

call. But our focus is on that phone. And when the kidnappers do reach

out, or we’re told to make contact, we turn our attention fully to it.

They initially demand $5 million in ransom. I know from experience

and training that if we agree to pay it immediately, they’ll ask for more;

or they’ll take it and then hit another of the company’s ships next week.

So with my coaching, John begins communicating with the kidnappers.

“That is a lot of money, which we don’t have. We need time to see how

much we can raise. Let’s speak again in two days.”

Later, “You seem upset that we can’t move faster, but I assure you we are

trying our best. Please look after the hostages.”

Later, “OK, let me make sure I’m understanding you. If we deliver

the cash as agreed, you promise to release and return the hostages

unharmed? And no further demands or delays?”

Our aim is not just to stall for time but also to build rapport and trust

with the other side. This is critical to success in high-stakes situations.
