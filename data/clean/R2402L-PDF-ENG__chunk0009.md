Pirates have kidnapped six crew members off a ship operating in the

Gulf of Guinea, near the west coast of Africa. The corporate owner of

the vessel and employer of the victims has called me in from England

to help negotiate their release. My ﬁrst step is to calm everyone down.

We can’t navigate this situation from a place of agitation and high stress.

My second is to choose someone from the corporate crisis team whom

I trust to interact with the bad guys—a person who can communicate

in the right language and dialect, who seems emotionally stable and

resilient, and who, most important, will be able to listen to and connect

with the people holding his colleagues. I quickly decide on John.
