and decisions may reduce status differences within the team and accentuate the team’s identity. As such, individuals may feel valued as both individuals and members of the team, thereby strengthening their sense of inclusion.

Given the range of behaviors to enact inclusive leadership, leaders may beneﬁt from resources to understand the concept and demonstration of in- clusive leadership as well as the different approaches to building more in- clusive work climates. Instruments that provide a list of inclusive leadership behaviors in which leaders may engage, similar to the one offered by Chrobot- Mason & Roberson (in press), may be useful for highlighting inclusive leadership behaviors in a variety of settings. Such instruments may also help leaders learn more about inclusive behaviors that can be incorporated into their daily activities and interactions as well as recognize areas for future development. We might also normalize inclusive leadership by integrating the knowledge and development of such behaviors into business curricula and other leadership training programs.

The ﬁndings also provide insight into the design of leadership development initiatives to create more inclusive leaders. Development programs should provide current and future leaders with opportunities to experiment with and practice inclusive leadership behaviors. For example, special projects or other stretch assignments with teams characterized by different types and amount of diversity may help leaders learn how to foster inclusive environments. Such experiences may be further supplemented by assessments that allow leaders to self-evaluate and gain insight from their direct reports on behavioral areas of improvement for becoming more inclusive. Coaching to strengthen leaders’ capacity for inclusive leadership as well as rewards for exhibiting inclusive behaviors may also be important for bringing about behavioral change and strengthening climates for inclusion in organizations.
