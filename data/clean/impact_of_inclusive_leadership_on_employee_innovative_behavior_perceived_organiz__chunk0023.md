# Measures

To maximize the validity and reliability of the measurement tools, we used existing scales pub- lished in top journals. The original scales were all written in English. Thus, we followed the back translation procedures recommended by Brislin (1980) [66] to translate the measures. A management scholar who was fluent in both English and Chinese translated the items from English into Chinese. We then asked another bilingual management professor to translate the items from Chinese back into English. We also asked a management researcher to check the English and Chinese translations, and any discrepancies in the translation procedure were solved through discussion. Furthermore, before finalizing the formal questionnaire and sur- vey, a pre-survey was conducted to guarantee the appropriateness of the questionnaire design and diction to the study context. The questionnaire was then revised based on feedback
