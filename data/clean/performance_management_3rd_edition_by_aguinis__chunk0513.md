But that vision is now a reality. Microsoft has come up with a new vision: “putting a computer in every car and every pocket.”14

Table 3.3 includes a list of the features that should be present in a good vision statement. Think about your current employer (or last employer, if you are not currently employed). Take a look at Table 3.3. How many of these features are reflected in your organization’s vision statement?

3.2.1.4 GOALS After an organization has analyzed its external opportunities and threats as well as internal strengths and weaknesses and has defined its mission and vision, it can realistically establish goals that will further its mission. The purpose of setting such goals is to formalize statements about what the organization hopes to achieve in the medium- to long-range period (i.e., within the next three years or so). Goals provide more specific information regarding how the mission will be
