# Penalties/Sanctions

The child labor "hot goods" provision of the Act prohibits the shipment or delivery of goods in interstate

commerce that were produced in or about an establishment where a child labor violation occurred in the past

30 days. It is also a violation of the Act to ﬁre or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for

ﬁling a complaint or for participating in a legal proceeding under the Act.

Employers are subject to a civil money penalty of up to $11,000 per worker for each violation of the child labor provisions. In addition, employers are subject to a civil money penalty of $50,000 for each violation occurring

after May 21, 2008 that causes the death or serious injury of any minor employee - such penalty may be

doubled, up to $100,000, when the violations are determined to be willful or repeated. When a civil money

penalty is assessed, employers have the right to ﬁle an exception to the determination within 15 days of

receipt of the notice of such penalty. When an exception is ﬁled, it is referred to an Administrative Law Judge for a hearing and determination as to whether the penalty is appropriate. Either party may appeal the decision

of the Administrative Law Judge to the Department of Labor's Administrative Review Board. If an exception is

not ﬁled within the 15 days, the penalty becomes ﬁnal.

The Act also provides for a criminal ﬁne of up to $10,000 upon conviction for a willful violation. For a second

conviction for a willful violation, the Act provides for a ﬁne of not more than $10,000 and imprisonment for up to six months, or both. The Secretary may also bring suit to obtain injunctions to restrain persons from

violating the Act.
