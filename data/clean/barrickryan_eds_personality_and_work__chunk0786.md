## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 271

et al. (2001) assessed the team’s extraversion by using the average of team members minus the person whose ﬁt was being assessed. However, results by Barrick et al. (1998) suggest additional ways in which team personality may be modeled. They described three methods of operationalizing team personality composition: mean score for the group, variability (variance, proportion of members possessing a particular trait), and minimum and maximum scores on a trait. Whether these methods could be applied to the assess- ment of PG or even PO ﬁt with any meaning is another question worth pursuing.

One ﬁnal issue is that the question of whether personality- based PO ﬁt matters may be too simplistic. Given our knowledge of the usefulness of certain personality traits as predictors of per- formance, we could ask whether any organization cares about ﬁt on conscientiousness and emotional stability; instead, ﬁrms want to hire individuals high on these traits regardless of the current lev- els in the workforce. However, PO ﬁt on these two traits will still matter for outcomes such as satisfaction, as the highly conscien- tious individual will be less satisﬁed when there is low ﬁt. Thus, it is overly simplistic to talk about PO ﬁt on personality affecting out- comes. We must consider what traits we are talking about and what outcomes we are hoping to predict. We expand on this more fully in the next section.
