# Workshops and classes

Informational events can provide useful background knowledge to all

employees. Several organizations oﬀer workplace training, the most

popular being the Mental Health First Aid Course oﬀered by the

National Council for Mental Wellbeing. Mental health nonproﬁts such

as the National Alliance on Mental Illness – New York City (where I am

on the board) also provide training.
