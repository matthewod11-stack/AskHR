## Reconciling Perspectives on Inclusive Leadership

Although inclusive leadership theory and research derive from both diversity and leadership research traditions, there are a few common elements that emerge from these literature streams that together suggest behaviors for enacting an inclusive approach to leadership. Based on prior research in this area, we expect that inclusive leadership incorporates behaviors to create a sense of shared identity among work group members. According to leadership research, information regarding an individual’s value to the group is communicated by the leader (Tyler & Lind, 1992), who is also seen as a representative or prototype group member, establishing behaviors that group members should adopt. Accordingly, we expect leaders to enact behaviors that facilitate a common identity within the group and that invite and appreciate others’ contributions. We also anticipate leaders to emphasize behaviors that treat individuals as an insider and address their needs for belongingness.

The enactment of inclusive leadership within the leadership and diversity literatures also incorporates behaviors to reduce status differences within workgroups. Drawing from leadership perspective on inclusiveness, we expect leaders to highlight behaviors to solicit and integrate the viewpoints and opinions from those whose input into decision-making processes may not typically be valued. We also conjecture that leader efforts to be approachable and reachable by all members of the work group, which prior research posits to reduce potential barriers to interaction and information exchange, partic- ularly among those who might typically be considered outsiders, will be salient. In effect, we also anticipate that leaders will draw attention to be- haviors focused on eradicating cliques and other status boundaries within the team. As this reduction of status distinction is also an important component of inclusive leadership from a diversity management perspective, we expect leaders to describe actions to ensure equity and justice within the work group as critical to the enactment of inclusive leadership.

Existing theory and research also underscores the importance of follower participation and involvement in decision processes. Leadership researchers
