Think twice before asking for fewer reports

When you’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed, it’s tempting to ask for

fewer direct reports, but it’s important to think through the potential

risks of making that request. “It could send the wrong message to

management,” says Gupta. You might be seen as wanting to step back

from your responsibilities or as incapable of shouldering them, which

could have unintended consequences for your career trajectory, he says.

However, if you can demonstrate that the size of your team is too big for

the kind of work you’re doing or that it poses risks to the organization

— for instance, a nurse with dozens of direct reports — you should “feel

empowered to escalate” the issue, says McDowell. “Articulate what the

challenge is, why change is needed, and oﬀer solutions.”
