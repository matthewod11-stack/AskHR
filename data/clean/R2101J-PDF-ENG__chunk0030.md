## According to FW Cook, 83% of the 250 largest S&P 500

firms use a formulaic annual incentive plan, or one that includes predefined metrics and weightings. These plans tend to incorporate multiple metrics; 76% have at least two. The most common are profits (used by 91%) and revenues (used by 49%). Seventy percent of the companies also use nonfinancial (both strategic and individual) metrics, though theyâ€™re usually weighted less heavily than financial goals.
