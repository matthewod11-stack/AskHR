include at least one environmental, social, or governance (ESG) goal. In some cases targets are attached to those goals, and in others the goals are part of an assessment of strategic performance. Among the companies using ESG measures, 43% set human capital goals (such as diversity, employee engagement, and a positive company culture); 25% set health, safety, or environmental goals; and 32% use both types.
