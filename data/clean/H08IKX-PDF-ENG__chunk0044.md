# Conclusion

Understanding how to deal with complex problems is crucial for today’s

business leaders in dealing with uncertainly and addressing problems

as they arise. Applying a complicated solution to a complex problem

will only make the problem worse. Leaders must consider whether they

are rationalizing or sensemaking, favoring predictability or ambiguity,

managing risk or uncertainty, and using logic or intuition to avoid this

pitfall. Tackling complex problems will require leaders with the ability

to use intuition, creativity, and ﬂexibility.
