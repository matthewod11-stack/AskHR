# receive fair recognition for their work.

What were the bias interrupters that proved so eﬀective? In addition

to the ATO workshop, keeping metrics, and using the tasking tool, the

company decided to address an underlying driver of unfair access to

opportunities: the fast pace of their work, which left harried managers

at hand. This meant others never got the opportunity to learn new skills

and grow their careers.
