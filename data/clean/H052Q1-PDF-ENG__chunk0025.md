industry-, country-, and conference call characteristics — most notably,

the underlying ﬁnancial numbers being discussed.

The range was dramatic. When an Anglo-Saxon executive and a Chinese

executive discussed the same ﬁnancial results, the difference in their tone

tended to be the same as the difference you might ﬁnd when two

executives from the same cultural background discuss two substantially

different results, one in the top 10% of the distribution and the other in the

bottom 10%. (This corresponds roughly to the tone those executives might

use when one is discussing performance that has beaten the consensus by

several cents per share, and the other is discussing performance that has

fallen short by the same amount.)

Some foreign executives are new to the art of earnings calls, so you might

be tempted to attribute their performance to nothing more than a lack of

preparedness. But you shouldn’t. Our ﬁndings on this front held, in

somewhat muted form, even when we only looked at U.S-based ﬁrms and

executives: U.S.-based executives with non-Anglo-Saxon roots still showed

signs of their cultural ancestry in the way they spoke but less so than if

they had not been exposed to the U.S. environment. We didn’t try to

determine at what point the executives or their ancestors immigrated to

the United States, but other studies show that cultural heritage persists

over time and difficult to shake off even after several generations.

Do investors see through these cultural differences? They generally do not.

If an Anglo-Saxon and a Southeast Asian CEO both report ﬁnancial results

that meet the consensus estimates on Wall Street, the former will elicit a
