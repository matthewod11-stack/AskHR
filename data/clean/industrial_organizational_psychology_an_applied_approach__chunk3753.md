At a personal level, stress can affect marriages and relationships with oth- ers. At a health level, stress results in a number of psychological (e.g., anxiety, depression) and physical disorders (e.g., joint pain, cardiovascular problems). At an organizational level, stress results in burnout, increased drug and alcohol use, lower job satisfaction, increased absenteeism, and increased turnover. Type A individuals and pessimists are more prone to stress than Type B individuals and optimists. Such techniques as exercise, laughter, a healthy diet, not smoking, getting plenty of sleep, joining support groups, self-empowerment, and time management can reduce stress. Workplace violence can result from employee stress.
