# Implement a weekly win routine

Once a week or twice a month, send a brief, bulleted email to your

boss highlighting your team’s achievements, challenges overcome, and

upcoming milestones. By doing so, you’re handing them a neatly

packaged “cheat sheet” of information they can use to impress their

boss and peers. It’s a win-win: your manager appears on top of things —

and your hard work gets the spotlight it deserves.

This simple routine also gets you into the habit of articulating and

documenting your achievements which is a powerful way of boosting

your conﬁdence. Plus, come time for your performance review, you’ll

have concrete examples at your ﬁngertips and won’t have to scramble

for data to make a case for resources or advancement.
