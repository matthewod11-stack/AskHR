# 392 Forensic Psychology

legal settings, (b) the effects of the law on the practice of psy- chology, and (c) research and scholarly inquiry as applied to legal issues” (Hess, 1999, p. 24). Elsewhere, Hess noted the difﬁculty of deﬁning forensic psychology, as he asked, “Is there a forensic psychology? Or, Is there a set of associated forensic psychologies? This is a crucial issue facing us” (Hess, 1996, p. 239).

The second popular deﬁnition of forensic psychology is more circumscribed, focusing on the clinical aspects. Many psychologists deﬁne forensic psychology more narrowly to refer to clinical psychologists who are engaged in clinical practice within the legal system. The distinction here is be- tween psychologists who bring scientiﬁc information to the courts for their consideration in cases and psychologists who evaluate individuals and testify about them in reference to a legal question.

The second question, concerning when forensic psychol- ogy began, also has a broad and narrow deﬁnition. A broad perspective would see the starting point as that time when psychological concepts—that is, notions of psychological functioning—were ﬁrst applied to address forensic questions. One might qualify this by requiring that these concepts were offered to courts by professionals. This deﬁnition would date forensic psychology at least back to the eighteenth century when physicians and neurologists testiﬁed in insanity cases. The narrower view would contend that forensic psychology cannot be said to have existed until there was a ﬁeld called “psychology.” It was not until the mid-twentieth century that psychologists were routinely allowed to testify about insanity and competency, roles that were the exclusive purview of psychiatrists until then (Bartol & Bartol, 1999).

If one adopts the broad perspective, where and when did forensic psychology begin? The beginnings of forensic psychology could be identiﬁed at least as far back as the an- cient Greeks, as Hippocrates (ca. 480 B.C.E.) identiﬁed two forms of mental illness, melancholia and mania. The ancient Romans also wrote about “madness” as a medical and legal problem. Similarly, ancient Hebraic law stated that “idiots” and “lunatics” should not be held criminally responsible for their acts because they could not distinguish right from wrong (Maeder, 1985). The issue of madness received in- creasing scrutiny over the centuries. By the thirteenth cen- tury, the policy in England was to use the regular system of prosecution to determine guilt and then use “the King’s mercy” as a possible basis for avoiding the execution of an insane convicted person. By the sixteenth century, in England the idea that a madman should be acquitted, not convicted, was widely accepted (Weinreb, 1986). The evolution of this linkage between the law and the psychological concept of insanity will be brieﬂy outlined in the next section.

Where does all of this leave us? For historical complete- ness, we will begin our analysis with an overview of the early ideas about insanity held by legal systems. We leave it to the reader to interpret this as either the early beginnings of foren- sic psychology or a historical precursor to the later emergence of forensic psychology as a subﬁeld within psychology.
