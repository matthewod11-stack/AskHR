## HBR / Digital Article / How AI Is Helping Companies Redesign Processes

For example, consider the work of monitoring and inspection at energy and chemical plants, pipelines, oﬀshore facilities, and wind and solar

farms. This work used to be exclusively done in person by inspectors

and maintenance technicians, but AI can ease that constraint. Now

many low value-adding inspection tasks can instead be done remotely

by robots and drones. Some Shell facilities are so large that it would

previously have taken years to inspect everything manually — now

drones and robots are being introduced to automate these processes

and help shorten the cycle time.
