# 254 PERSONALITY AND WORK

learners use particular study strategies or be devoted to develop- ing skills in planning, monitoring, and evaluating their own learn- ing. Trainees could be asked to set challenging learning goals, visualize possible courses of action, reï¬‚ect on how much they have learned, and consider whether alternative learning strategies might be more effective. These efforts are more proximal to the desired learning outcomes. What is interesting is the extent to which dif- ferent personality characteristics affect and are affected by inter- ventions to improve the learning processes of the learner.
