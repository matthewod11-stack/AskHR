# Systemic vision

Designers should treat problems as system problems with opportunities for systemic solutions involving different procedures and concepts to create a holistic solution.

Ability to use language as a tool

Designers should be able to verbally explain their creative process forcing invention where detail is lacking and expressing rela- tionships not obvious visually (i.e., explana- tion should go hand in hand with the creative process).
