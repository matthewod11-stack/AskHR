# Role Connection

Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi researched and wrote about the

idea of “ﬂow”: the experience of being so absorbed in an activity that

other things seem to almost fade away. While most of us won’t ﬁnd a

role where we spend the majority of our time in a ﬂow state, we can

deﬁnitely gather insights about what motivates us and ﬁnd ourselves in

satisfying roles.

When we experience role connection, we have a clear understanding of

what our job is, we’re engaged in what we’re doing, and we have insight

into how we can advance. When we have role connection, we are lifted

up by the work we do.
