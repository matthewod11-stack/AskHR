# Dress professionally.

Be prepared when you attend a meeting, arrive early, act interested, and always support your boss (you can always disagree later in private). Deliver more than you promise.

Be positive. Praise others in public. Don’t complain about your current employer and coworkers or about previous employers. Nobody likes a whiner! Put your customers first and make them rave about you! Ask questions and learn from your mistakes.

management (Brett & Atwater, ). But few employees are perfect, and some negative feedback is inevitable. Because of this, positive feedback generally should be given first, followed by the negative feedback, and finishing with more posi- tive feedback (Stone, Gueutal, & McIntosh, ). This process is often referred to as the “feedback sandwich,” in which the negative feedback is sandwiched between positive feedback. Liberal use of positive feedback not only helps employees accept the negative feedback, but also helps supervisors who tend to avoid providing negative feedback in an effort to reduce the chance of interper- sonal conflict (Waung & Highhouse, ). Any major differences between the employee’s self-ratings and those given by the supervisor should be discussed until both understand the differences.

The next step is perhaps the most important. Because few employees receive perfect evaluations, it is essential to discuss the reasons an employee’s perfor- mance is not considered to be perfect. The employee may lack some knowledge as to how to perform the job properly, may have been assigned too many duties, or may have outside problems that affect her work performance.

The supervisor’s acknowledgement that there may be external reasons for an employee’s poor performance can increase the employee’s satisfaction with the review and enable her to perceive the feedback and evaluation as accurate and helpful. In addition, it will help the employee understand and appreciate the supervisor’s perceptions (Bannister, ). Feedback should be candid, specific, and behavioral rather than personal. Awareness and acknowledgment of external factors for performance is especially important because we have a tendency, called the fundamental attribution error, to attribute others’ failure or poor performance to personal rather than situational factors.

Once the problems have been identified, the next and most difficult task is to find solutions. What can the supervisor do to help? What can the organiza- tion do? What can the employee do? The idea here is that solutions to the prob- lems result from joint effort. Too often we attribute poor performance solely to the fault of the employee, when, in fact, performance is affected by many factors (see Figure .).

At the conclusion of the interview, goals should be mutually set for future performance and behavior, and both supervisor and employee should under- stand how these goals will be met (Bacal, ). Goals and goal setting will be thoroughly discussed in Chapter . For now, however, we should keep in mind that goals should be concrete and reasonable and set by both employee and supervisor. The Career Workshop box gives tips on how employees can help themselves in terms of performance appraisals.
