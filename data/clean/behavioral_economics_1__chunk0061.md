Causing preferences: Some areas in the brain are active during economic decision making. So what is

learned from knowing precisely where those regions are? The answer is that regions develop at different rates

across the life cycle, are different across species, use different neurotransmitters, have different types of

neurons, and participate in decisions that might seem superficially different. (For example, the insula which is

activated by low ultimatum offers, is also activated by bodily discomforts like pain and disgust; so when a

person says an offer is “disgustingly low” they may be speaking rather literally.)

Knowing which regions are part of the neural circuit for a particular decision enables us to use other

knowledge about specialization to make new types of predictions. Valuation of a good—a utility—, which is

often thought of as basic preference, might actually be the middle phase of a biological process. Valuations are

an input to a more complex downstream process which incorporates prices, budget constraint, and possibly

31

social concerns (e.g., peer pressure or rational conformity). But valuations are also the output of an earlier

upstream process, which should perhaps be considered the “primitive” in modeling preferences.

A behavioral way to demonstrate an understanding of the process that creates expressed preferences is to

show how changing variables can cause or influence preferences. In standard economic terms, preferences are

“state-dependent”, where the states are internal biological states (that can also be changed exogeneously). Then

the important questions are: What are those states? And does an executive cortical process understand how the

state-dependence works, and influences it or compensates for exogeneous shocks?

For example, the oxytocin hormone is involved in social bonding and is implicated in studies of trust

games (Zak et al, 2005). It follows that if oxytocin can be increased exogeneously, and the brain does not undo

the effect of the exogeneous change, then adding oxytocin might create trust. Kosfeld et al (2005) showed

exactly this effect. They administered synthetic oxytocin to subjects, which increased the amount those subjects

invested in a trust game. The capacity to change behavior (traditionally interpreted as revelation of preferences)

is routine for neuroscientists. Direct stimulation of single neurons is conjectured to create preferences for one

choice or another, by intervening upstream.

This approach suggests a general recipe for causing changes in behavior. As noted earlier in section B,

most dual-process models posit two processes: (1) A controlled, long-run, deliberative, or “cold” process which

accepts inputs and tries to constrain or override another (2) process which is automatic, short-run, affective, or

“hot”. The recipe for changing behavior is to either stimulate the second process directly, and see whether the

first type of deliberative process undoes the exogeneous change, or to place cognitive overload on the first

process (tying up its scarce resources) and see whether its ability to constrain the second process suffers. Lerner,

Small and Loewenstein (2004) stimulate the second process. They induced emotional states which affected how

people priced goods they were endowed with (reversing the typical “endowment effect” in which owned goods

are valued more highly). Shiv and Fedorikhin (1999) constrained the first (controlled) process. They asked

32

subjects remember either simple (2-digit) or difficult (7-digit) strings of numerical digits as they walked by

foods that were tempting (potato chips) or virtuous (fruit). Overloading the controller system with the more

taxing 7-digit memory task led to more consumption of the tempting foods. The simplest language of preference

theory would say that the difficult 7-digit memory task “changed preferences”. A more detailed view, and a

more useful one, is that resistance to temptation requires scarce cognitive resources; multitasking which

consume these resources lowers resistance and leads people to eat more chips.
