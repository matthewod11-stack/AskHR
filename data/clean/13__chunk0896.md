## Developing New Research on Humor and Culture in Organizations

used. As we have alluded throughout this paper, the issue of humor use across hierarchical levels is particularly relevant for the analysis of culture differences, given the substantial variability across societies and organiza- tions in the degree to which hierarchical differences are accepted and maintained.

In addition, humor theorists must pay careful attention to levels of analysis and levels of theory (Klein, Dansereau, & Hall, 1994). The theoretical construct of humor is amenable to examination at multiple levels. For example, at the individual level, one might examine individual difference variables such as humor production, humor appreciation, or individual behaviors driven by humor. At the group level, humor can be treated as a climate variable, if, for instance, there is considerable within- group agreement about the receptiveness of a group to humor. At a more macro level, humor can be viewed as a cultural or level phenomenon. If, for example, one hypothesizes that societal norms inﬂuence individuals’ predispositions toward humor production, differences between societies might be meaningful.
