Culture also has the potential for treatment at different levels of analysis. Culture is usually conceptualized as a societal or organizational level construct. However, there is considerable evidence suggesting that cultural values such as individualism and collectivism can be examined meaningfully at the individual level of analysis (e.g., Robert & Wasti, 2002; Triandis, Leung, Villareal, & Clack, 1985), and that cultural values vary across geographic areas (Vandello & Cohen, 1999) and across some ethnic groups within the U.S. (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmeier, 2002). Given the potential for variability within both societies and organizations, research that examines the relationship between humor and culture might fruitfully explore cultural values at the individual level of analysis.
