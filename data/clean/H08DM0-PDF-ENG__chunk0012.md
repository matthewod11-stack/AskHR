# Practice empathy.

It’s tough to summon compassion for someone whose rushed decisions

are making your job harder, but “put yourself in your new boss’s shoes,”

says Banu. “They’ve just started at a new organization and they’re eager

to prove themselves.”

Bear in mind, too, your new boss might be dealing with pressure from

higher-ups that you’re not aware of. They may be trying to deliver

on promises they made during their interviews, which often means

bringing about big changes in a short amount of time, says Martin.

In other words: Your new boss is monumentally stressed. “In the ﬁrst 90

days, you’re not seeing them at their best,” says Martin. Assume good

intentions and “give them grace.”
