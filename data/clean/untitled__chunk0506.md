## The State of Comparative Psychology between the Wars

The comparative psychologists educated during the 1920s and 1930s placed comparative psychology on a ﬁrm footing. Unlike the pre–World War I cadre, this group was successful in securing research support and in educating a next genera- tion of comparative psychologists who would carry on the tradition. Nevertheless, much was not well. This group of comparative psychologists, which appears to coalesce as a coherent unit when viewed in retrospect, did not appear so when viewed in its time. There were a number of reasons for this.

Disciplines and subdisciplines become recognizable and inﬂuential with the development of a set of institutional land- marks including departments, textbooks, courses, research facilities, organizations, meetings, and journals. During this period, comparative psychology was well established in many departments, and courses were a staple in many places. In other respects, however, it lacked elements that foster cohesion.
