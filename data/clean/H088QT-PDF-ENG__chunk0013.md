# Culture

Many leaders also worry about the diﬃculty of building and sustaining

corporate culture when employees are physically together less often,

meeting mostly virtually, and often multitasking rather than fully

engaging in those get-togethers. Some managers have told us that even

when their team members are in the oﬃce together they still meet via

Zoom or Teams rather than face-to-face. They also report that people seem more eager to take oﬀ as soon as the workday ends, leading to

poorly attended happy hours and other social events.

Again, we suggest that organizations reframe their “ask” to employees.

Instead of encouraging people to come to the oﬃce to boost the

organization’s culture and their own interaction with peers, try

appealing to their motivation to help others. Research on prosocial impact suggests that will be more eﬀective than emphasizing the

beneﬁts to the company or even themselves. (In one study, for

example, medical workers were more likely to wash their hands when

signs highlighted patient rather than personal safety.) Explain how

employees’ presence in the oﬃce might help coworkers, customers, or clients and make them more eﬀective mentors, allies, and advocates.

Research also suggests that people especially value the opportunity

to interact with the beneﬁciaries of their work, so arranging such

encounters might also help entice workers to come in more often.
