# Fig. 11 Employee journey

The best explanation of employee journey is based on a study from Gallup, a global

analytics and advice firm. Gallup defines the Seven Essential Stages of the Employee

Life Cycle, the stages an employee goes through with an organization, from being

interested to being hired to working there to leaving at some point, and interaction that

employee has with managers and colleagues at each stage. (Gallup, 2021)
