# Self-Appraisals

Self-appraisals, not surprisingly, are less accurate than appraisals from other sources. Self-appraisals have the lowest agreement with other rating sources (peers and super-

visors), and the lowest ability to predict the person’s subsequent performance. An intri- guing ﬁnding is that those whose self-apprai- sal is aligned with the appraisals they receive from others are usually high performers. This is because they score high on ‘‘self-aware- ness’’ of their abilities. Moreover, employees whose self-evaluations are in agreement with evaluations from their subordinates have been found to be more promotable than those whose self-ratings are inﬂated.

Overall, multisource feedback provides a comprehensive way of appraising employ- ees. It improves the accuracy of appraisals through the multiple viewpoints that are obtained, and it increases perceptions of fairness by ensuring that a biased source (e.g., one’s boss) is not over-represented in the appraisal process.
