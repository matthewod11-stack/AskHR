having their wages depend on a variable out of their control if it benefits them

by reducing undesirable variance in adjusted wages. This changes if workers have

preferences for fairness. Sometimes the value of y; will lead the firm to penalize a

worker when true effort e; was high (e.g., firing a successful CEO who was much

less successful than industry peers). Workers may think this is unfair.

A common example is benchmarking performance to an outside standard, like

industry profits. Risk-averse workers should like benchmarking because it buffers

them against industry-wide shocks. But evidence for direct benchmarking in execu-

tive compensation is surprisingly scarce, even though it is not hard to create simple

benchmarks which would reduce compensation variance a lot. It does not appear

that wages are even indirectly very sensitive to benchmarks (Antle and Smith 1996;

Salani√© 2003, p. 470).7
