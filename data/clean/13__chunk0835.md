Research on brain activity and brain physiology associated with humor strongly suggests that humor appreciation includes related yet unique cognitive and affective (emotional) processes. Speciﬁcally, researchers have documented that brain activity that corresponds closely with an incongruity explanation of humor can be identiﬁed (for more technical details, see Derks et al., 1997; Fry, 2002; Vaid et al., 2003; Wild, Rodden, Grodd, & Ruch, 2003). However, additional brain activity associated with emotional responses to humor has also been identiﬁed. For example, in a study on humor and brain physiology, Shammi and Stuss (1999) found that individuals with damage in speciﬁc parts of the right frontal lobe emitted fewer behavioral and emotional responses to jokes (i.e., smiling and laughing), even when they reported that they were able to ‘‘get’’ the jokes and could distinguish the funny jokes from the non-funny ones. In other words, participants with deﬁciency in that speciﬁc area of the brain could
