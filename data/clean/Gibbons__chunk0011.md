[Human-AI expert \| Managing Director at BOI \| Author]{.underline}

[As we all know, AI agents can \'do\' things now, not just respond to
chat queries. Book flights (I don\'t know why everybody uses that
example, but they do). Update sales records. Instruct a warehouse robot.
This isn\'t science fiction. It\'s Tuesday.]{.underline}

[For the world of work, this means that we need to treat AI as a
co-worker, a member of the team. The era of hybrid teams, where your
direct reports include both humans and AI agents, has arrived. And most
organizations are completely unprepared for what this
means.]{.underline}

[Welcome to management in 2025, where success depends on orchestrating
collaboration between carbon and silicon colleagues.]{.underline}
