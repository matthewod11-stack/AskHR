### **[The new org chart]{.underline}**

[Forget everything you know about organizational design. The \'org
chart\' looking forward shouldn\'t just show human relationships. It
shows AI agents as team members with specific roles, responsibilities,
and reporting structures.]{.underline}

[At Kaiser Permanente, the care team now includes AI agents that handle
ambient documentation, saving 16,000 hours in 15 months. These agents
don\'t just execute tasks --- they learn from feedback, adapt to
individual physician styles, and flag potential issues for human review
(Kaiser Permanente, 2025).]{.underline}

[The human physicians don\'t just use these agents as tools. They manage
them like team members. They provide feedback, adjust parameters, and
coordinate handoffs. The agents, in turn, provide performance data back
to help physicians improve their own practices. This bidirectional
management --- humans managing AI, AI providing feedback to humans ---
is the new normal. And most organizations are completely unprepared for
it.]{.underline}
