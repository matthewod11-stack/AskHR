## Direction of Growth: Scale, Scope, or Diversify?

Since demand ultimately fuels growth, selecting which market

opportunities to pursue is a critical component of a company’s overall

growth strategy. Some companies seek growth by scaling in their core

market. Others broaden their scope into adjacent products and services.

Still others diversify into a range of seemingly unrelated industries.

Which strategies are most proﬁtable over the long term has long been a

topic of hot debate, and my research suggests there is no simple answer.
