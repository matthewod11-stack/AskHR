## Social Relationships, Cooperation, and Helping Behavior

Perhaps the most robust ﬁnding in the study of subjective well-being is that affect and satisfaction are moderately to strongly correlated with a variety of social variables. For example, researchers have re- peatedly shown that the personality trait of extraversion (which re- ﬂects the degree to which people enjoy and feel comfortable in social situations) is strongly correlated with subjective well-being. Lucas and Fujita (2000) showed that the meta-analytically derived average correlation between extraversion and positive affect is .37, that this correlation often rises to .80 when multiple measures of extraversion and pleasant affect are used to model the relation, and that the relation is not due to methodological artifacts such as response sets or item overlap in extraversion and pleasant affect scales. Lucas, Diener, Grob, Suh, and Shao (2000) showed that the relation is robust and consistent across a variety of cultures. Other researchers have shown that it is not just feelings of sociability that are related to well-being. Social activity itself is correlated with pos- itive affect, both between persons and within persons over time (Clark & Watson, 1988; Lucas, 2000; Okun, Stock, Haring, & Wit- ter, 1984).

One interpretation of these ﬁndings is that social activity and personality traits that promote social activity cause happiness and well-being. However, an equally plausible alternative—and one with an increasing amount of empirical support—is that positive affect actually causes people to engage in and enjoy social contact. For example, Isen (1970) and Cunningham (1988a) found that peo- ple who experienced a positive mood induction were more likely than those who did not to engage in social contact (including ini- tiating conversation and disclosing personal information). Diener, Lyubomirsky, and King (2001) suggested at least three reasons that positive affect would foster positive interpersonal relationships. First, positive affect appears to make people like other people
