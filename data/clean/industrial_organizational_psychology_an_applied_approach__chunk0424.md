# The Vancouver Interna-

tional Airport, located in Richmond, British Columbia, is Canadaâ€™s second busiest airport; serving over 17.5 million passengers in 2007. It has been named the top airport in North American for overall customer satisfac- tion. Thus, it takes great pride in its employees and their performance.

The Airport Authority oversees more than 300 employees in such areas as project management, finance, human resources, engineer- ing, communications, and emergency preparedness. Employees working for the airlines, stores, and restaurants are not part of the Airport

Authority as they are employ- ees of private companies. To reduce costs and increase productivity, the Vancouver Airport Authority designed a wellness program for its employees. The program, called Fitness and Balance, comprised many components, including seminars on such topics as smoking cessation and stress management; health-related newsletters and announcements; outdoor-ac- tivity days in which employees and their families could hike, skate, or walk; and discounts at fitness facilities. To deter- mine the effectiveness of this program, the Airport Authority collected data and found that absenteeism dropped from

4.07% to 2.55% and that the number of annual injuries dropped from 22 to 6. 7

How would you have designed the study to determine the effective- ness of the wellness program?
