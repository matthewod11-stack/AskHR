this is to send contributors the ﬁnal product and point out how they,

speciﬁcally, made a diﬀerence.

For leaders, actively aﬃrming the diﬀerent ways that their staﬀ

members have contributed—and asking managers too as well—will not

only make these workers feel appreciated and helpful. It is also likely to
