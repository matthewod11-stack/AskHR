## HBR / Magazine Article / When Diversity Meets Feedback

week.” He wouldn’t need to say, “The examples from this morning’s

presentation were not very good.” It would be implied clearly enough.

Jethro learned the same lesson Olga did: “I saw clearly that what

is normal and appropriate feedback in my culture may come oﬀ as

completely inappropriate somewhere else,” he reﬂects.

One way to gauge what feedback works best in another culture is

to listen carefully to the words chosen by your counterparts. People

from more-direct cultures tend to use what linguists call “upgraders”

when providing criticism. These are words that make criticism feel

stronger—like “absolutely,” totally,” or “completely.” For example, “This

is absolutely inappropriate” or “This is totally unprofessional.” By

contrast, more-indirect cultures use more “downgraders” when giving

negative feedback. These are words that soften the criticism, such as

“kind of,” “a little,” and “maybe.”

Another type of downgrader is a deliberate understatement—for

example, saying, “We are not quite there yet,” when you really mean

“This is nowhere close to complete,” or saying, “This is just my opinion,”

when you really mean “I’m certain this is obvious to everyone.”

With a little awareness you can notice when you’re using upgraders

and downgraders and when those around you are and make slight

adjustments to get the desired results. When it comes to providing

feedback internationally, the message is not “Do unto others as you

would have them do unto you” but “Do unto others as they would have

done unto themselves.”
