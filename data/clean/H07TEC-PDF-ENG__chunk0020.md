Variable selection is key.

The variables chosen for balanced benchmarking are arguably the most

important part of using this approach to assess performance. You’ll

need to think deeply about which variables you want the model to

minimize (i.e., the input variables) and maximize (i.e., the output

variables). Data on these variables needs to be regularly collected and

readily accessible, and must be tied back to factors that the individual

or team has control over. For example, requiring a marketing team

to minimize operational expenses associated with the production of

the product or service they are selling is outside of their control. It

would be more appropriate to require the marketing team to minimize

discretionary spending (e.g., travel, dining, etc.) associated with their

selling activity.
