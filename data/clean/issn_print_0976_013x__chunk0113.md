Previously, the tribal women of Beed district depended on the local aggregator who in turn had

a monopoly in this region. Hence the custard apple farmers in the district were not able to get

good prices for their yields. The aggregators used to buy custard apples from the local farmers at

rate of ₹4-5₹/kg and sell the same at the rate of ₹80 or more in the city markets. After the setting

up of the custard apple pulp processing unit as part of government intervention, the local farmers

were able to get ₹12-14 per kg.
