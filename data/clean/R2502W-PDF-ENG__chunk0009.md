# Two Fundamental Forces

Remaining on the frontier of expertise in important areas is

critical to any company’s success. Technological progress creates two

fundamental forces that complicate that challenge.

First, the overall body of expertise in the world is constantly expanding,

making it harder to stay at the leading edge in every relevant area.

For example, biotech companies are increasingly leveraging AI for drug

discovery—using it to analyze potential biological targets for new drugs,

to design new molecules, and to predict new drug-target interactions.

The ﬁeld is advancing rapidly, and the number of academic papers

referencing AI’s role and its application in drug discovery and other

areas of pharmaceutical research is growing exponentially. In 2001

fewer than 200 such papers were published. Twenty years later more

than 45,000 academic biology papers referenced AI. Staying abreast of

advances and insights is no longer possible for any individual scientist

or biotech company looking to use AI to accelerate discovery.

Second, the cost of accessing expertise is constantly falling. Although

that can beneﬁt existing companies, it can also lower the barriers

for new entrants. Think about how creator tools have transformed

the media landscape by reducing the cost of accessing expertise in

making and sharing high-quality content. Instagram and TikTok, for

example, provide video- and photo-editing tools, audio and music

integration, and analytics tools that enable amateurs to produce

professional content quickly and cheaply. Large brands have embraced

those platforms to reach their audiences, and individual artists and

inﬂuencers have adopted those tools to launch new businesses.

We believe that the interplay between these two factors—the increasing

amount of expertise required to create value and the decreasing cost

of accessing that expertise—shapes companies and aﬀects the scope
