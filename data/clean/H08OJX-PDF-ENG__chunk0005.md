# behavior.

Unlike traditional gaslighting, where an individual tries to make

another person doubt their own perceptions, corporate gaslighting

creates a negative narrative to convince an entire organization, team,

or structure to doubt an executive’s performance and role. This not

only aims to destroy their professional reputation but also erodes their

executive conﬁdence. In addition to spreading negative narrative and

exhibiting adversarial behavior on their victim, the perpetrator will use

other techniques to deny and reverse their victim’s position. They can

deﬂect confrontation, distort and downplay the severity of their actions.
