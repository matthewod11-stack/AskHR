# 2 Defining Engagement

Firstly, it is important to have a clear definition and understanding of engagement as a concept. The preliminary findings from the NIHR evidence synthesis (Truss et al, forthcoming) suggests that there a range of definitions of, and perspectives on, engagement even within the academic literature. Despite this, the synthesis identified the most prevalent definition used by the research community was that of engagement as (cid:515)a positive, fulfilling, work related state of mind(cid:516) (Schaufeli, González- Romá and ”akker(cid:514)s, (cid:344)(cid:342)(cid:342)(cid:344), p.(cid:349)(cid:346)(cid:508). This perspective views engagement as a positive psychological experience when carrying out work activities and work tasks, and refers to feelings of vigour (e.g. energy), dedication (e.g. enthusiasm), and absorption (e.g. feeling immersed).

In contrast, a review of the literature from the practitioner domain (e.g. CIPD, IES, Kenexa) found that the majority of definitions being used in practice would consider engagement as a general positive attitude towards the organisation, rather than a positive experience related to work activities or the job role (Holmes et al, forthcoming(cid:508). For example, Kenexa (cid:507)(cid:344)(cid:342)(cid:342)(cid:350), p.(cid:347)(cid:508) defines engagement as (cid:515)the extent to which employees are motivated to contribute to organisational success, and are willing to apply discretionary effort to accomplishing tasks important to the achievement of organisational goals(cid:516). However, it was also highlighted by Holmes et al (cid:507)forthcoming(cid:508) that many consultancies and survey houses have fuzzy definitions of engagement. This may reflect the fact that most consultancies sell commercial services related to engagement survey products, and so, to be competitive, they develop their own definition that is adapted for their target market.

NHS Employers has adopted the Institute for Employment Studies (IES) definition of employee engagement(cid:497) (cid:515)a positive attitude held by the employee towards the organisation and its values(cid:516) (Robinson, Perryman and Hayday, 2004, p.4) and specifies that (cid:515)engaged staff think and act in a positive way about the work they do, the people they work with and the organisation that they work in(cid:516) (NHS Employers, 2013). This views engagement as a deep connection that employees have with all aspects of their work life: their job, people they interact with at work, and the organisation that they work for. In this sense, the NHS defines engagement as both a psychological experience at work (i.e. the dominant view within the research community), and as a broader relationship with the organisation (i.e. the typical view taken by practitioners).
