## deviant behaviors such as cyberloaﬁng, tardiness, time theft, and

inattentiveness. These ﬁndings suggest that, rather than enhancing

productivity, remote monitoring may be stiﬂing your employees’

performance and eroding their trust.

Given the conﬂicting perspectives on the beneﬁts of monitoring — and

the reality that ﬁrms want to account for how their employees spend

their time — we sought to develop a more nuanced understanding

of remote employee monitoring by exploring how, why, and under

what conditions monitoring may yield positive or negative employee

outcomes. Our research suggests that not all monitoring practices

are created equal; their consequences depend on how monitoring is

conducted.
