Poor performance is a concern to senior managers because it is a measure of how effectively the organisation is led and is almost certainly a restriction on organisational productivity. To line managers it can be a time consuming and stressful experience. For employees it can result in extra work to cover those ‘not pulling their weight’.

However, despite its importance, Strebler (2004) found no clear or common definition applied in the organisations she studied. Instead, ‘interpretation seemed to be influenced by what was going on in their business at the time and this was what had prompted a review of their approach’. Managers could identify it at individual level but applied the label to a variety of behaviours and attitudes. Poor performance is legally defined as ‘when an employee’s behaviour or performance might fall below the required standard’. Some aspects of poor performance as organisationally defined, however, seem to be more concerned with poor management (in its broadest sense), eg from role overload or unclear objectives or unrealistic targets. Absence, which can again be seen as a sign of poor performance, can be due to a un-disclosed medical, personal or a domestic problem. When poor performance is associated with misconduct (and sometimes negligence) it probably is a disciplinary issue not ‘poor’ performance.

So the first question for organisations is to clarify when poor performance should be tackled at the employee (as opposed to work environment or job design) level. Taking the legal definition, this probably means concentrating on where the individual is failing to meet the necessary standards. This is an ‘absolute’ approach to assessment to be contrasted with ‘relative’ approaches made famous by GE where ‘poor’ performers are those that contribute the least, even if in a absolute sense they are reaching an acceptable performance level.

Strebler (2004) argues that employees therefore need to know what constitutes an acceptable level of performance, below which their organisation will consider their performance wanting. This is not as simple as it seems due to the ‘variety of
