# Moonlighting

As mentioned previously, one of the concerns with compressed workweeks is the possibility of employee fatigue. The same concern applies to employees work- ing more than one job, or moonlighting. For example, an employee might work the day shift as a machine operator for Ford Motor Company and then work the night shift as a store clerk for a -Eleven convenience store. People moonlight because they want or need to earn extra money, and they may even enjoy the second job (Baba & Jamal, ). According to U.S. Department of Labor statis- tics, .% of U.S. employees worked more than one job in . Moonlighting employees raise concerns about the effects of extra work on performance and absenteeism for these employees’ primary jobs.

Few studies have investigated the effects of moonlighting. Jamal () and Jamal and Crawford () surveyed more than  workers at six organizations and found that moonlighters were no different from nonmoonlighters in terms of mental health, quality of life, job performance, and intention to leave their com- panies. But moonlighters did miss about one day more of work per year than did nonmoonlighters.

Neither Arcuri and Lester (), Miller and Sniderman (), nor Mott Mann, McLoughlin, and Warwick () found any negative effects for moon- lighting. In fact, Mott and colleagues found that moonlighters were better adjusted and more active in the community than were their nonmoonlighting
