# Fatigue

.35

Regarding employee health, Williamson, Gower, and Clarke () found that employees who worked -hour shifts were healthier than those working eight-hour shifts. There were no differences in productivity or turnover. Duchon, Keran, and Smith () found even more positive results with underground mine workers. Mine workers changing from an eight- to a -hour shift reported higher satisfaction, improved sleep, and no negative health or performance changes.

In addition to these empirically verified benefits to employees, an organiza- tion that adopts compressed workweeks may realize other advantages. Perhaps the greatest of these is the reduction in start-up and cleanup times associated with many jobs. For example, a printer spends considerable time inking and set- ting up a press before beginning work. At the end of the day, the printer must also spend time cleaning the press and putting supplies away. If these beginning and ending activities together take an hour, then at least an hour a week can be saved if the printer works four days rather than five. Extended across a year and multi- plied by the number of employees in a company, such savings can be substantial. A word of caution should be made regarding the length of shifts. Though employees seem to suffer few problems with -hour shifts, there is probably an upper limit in shift length. For example, Knauth, Keller, Schindele, and Totterdell () found a -hour shift for firefighters to be too long.

To help reduce fatigue associated with long working hours, most organizations provide – minutes of paid breaks during the workday. Research suggests that providing four nine-minute breaks is superior to two -minute breaks or twelve three-minute breaks (Dababneh, Swanson, & Shell, ). Interestingly, in a  survey by the National Sleep Foundation, % of employees said that their employer allows them to take a nap during work breaks and % said that their employer actually gave them a place to nap. Such a practice may be a good idea, because in a study of Italian police, Garbarino () found that properly scheduled naps prior to working the night shift resulted in a % reduction in automobile accidents.
