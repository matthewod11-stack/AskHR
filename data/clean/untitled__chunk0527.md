# CONCLUSION: PERSISTENT ISSUES

Looking back over a little more than a century of compara- tive psychology, a number of characteristics are apparent. The conceptual foundations of comparative psychology have changed greatly. Some of these changes have been generated from within the ﬁeld; many more have been stimulated from related ﬁelds. Comparative psychologists have excelled in doing research and greatly expanded the body of data avail- able. It is this mass of information, sometimes well organized and sometimes rather scattered, that has enabled a century of change. Comparative psychologists have been empiricists working to expand the observational and experimental foun- dation of the ﬁeld; there are few postmodern comparative psychologists. In spite of the changes that have occurred, however, throughout the century there have been some per- sistent issues that have characterized the ﬁeld.

Surely the ﬁrst issue lies in the very deﬁnition of compar- ative psychology. Although comparative psychologists have written much about this problem, few have been truly both- ered by it. Even lacking a clear deﬁnition, most comparative psychologists have ignored the fuzzy boundaries of the ﬁeld and concentrated on the business of studying animals and building general principles of behavior.

The ﬁeld has been characterized by eclecticism, as most researchers have used whatever methods have appeared appropriate for the problem under study.Although some com- parative psychologists, such as Carpenter, Schneirla, Yerkes, Mason, and others, have conducted ﬁeld research, most have preferred the controlled conditions of the laboratory. Not all comparative psychologists make overt comparisons among species; the goal is not one of comparison for the sake of com- parison but rather the development of principles of generality. Although some, such as Kline, Schneirla, and James V. McConnell, have studied invertebrates, most have concen- trated on vertebrates, especially mammals. Some, such as Beach, Lehrman, and Carpenter, have concentrated on natu- rally occurring behavioral patterns; others have turned their attention to the study of learning and motivation in a compar- ative context. Although experimentation is the preferred method, many observational and correlational studies have been important. The anecdotes that characterized early re- search disappeared as laboratory methodology became more
