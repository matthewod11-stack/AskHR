I read these stories every day and it does make me nervous. I have

to be realistic and pragmatic. But I also think when I wrote the

book, I never thought it would be coming out necessarily in this

political environment, but I realized it’s more than just a book, it’s a

conversation. It’s a community, and I have to continue to put myself out

there and have conversations like we’re having, Adi, and conversations

with other people because the only way we’re going to overcome this is

by sharing our stories and sharing the facts and not allowing any part of

the political spectrum to demonize our lifestyle.

ADI IGNATIUS:

My only bit of wisdom from having been on this earth for a while is that

there’s no guarantee of progress. Sometimes you see it and imagine it’s a

straight line, but you really have to struggle for what you believe in.
