# CONCLUSION

Scientiﬁc and professional psychological societies and asso- ciations proliferated over the course of the twentieth century. Organizations such as those discussed in this chapter played

several important roles in the development of both the sci- ence and profession of psychology. Over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, scientiﬁc knowledge came to form the basis for social and professional authority. Scientiﬁc and professional organizations shared in and en- hanced this authority by providing a communal voice for the claims of their science or profession. This, in turn, led to in- creased credibility for claims to expert knowledge or practice (Appel, 1988; Hardcastle, 2000; Sokal, 1992). Scientists have recognized this for several centuries, as witnessed by the creation of scientiﬁc societies as each new realm of knowledge was discovered and professionalized (Frangsmyr, 1989; Shapin, 1996; Starr, 1982).

Scientiﬁc and professional organizations also exercise a certain measure of control over what counts as scientiﬁc knowledge or professional expertise (Pickren, 1995). This control allows them to exert authority over what qualiﬁes an individual to participate in the knowledge-production or pro- fessional practice process. In this way, scientiﬁc and profes- sional societies act as gatekeepers of social and professional authority.

The society or professional organization serves to set off areas of inquiry or practice that belong to that science or prac- tice and thus demarcate the boundaries of knowledge and practice (Abbott, 1988). These boundary lines allow for the deﬁnition of problems and the delineation of methods that are appropriate for the science or profession. In this way, they fa- cilitate the formation of professional identity (Gieryn, 1983, 1999).

The provision of professional identity is another important role played by organizations. A woman who belongs to the Cognitive Science Society, for example, has as part of her sense of professional self the identity of cognitive scientist that such membership provides. A national psychological so- ciety that belongs to the IUPsyS shares in the identity of in- ternational science that the larger organization provides. Often, there is a sense of exclusivity provided as part of this identity. For example, only one national organization per country can belong to the IUPsyS, and only 50 psychologists at a time could belong to Titchener’s Experimentalists.

There is often overlap in the knowledge claims and realms of practice among different sciences and professions. These scientiﬁc and professional borderlands have often led to ﬁerce rivalry, but they also have led to the creation of inter- disciplinary organizations (Pickren, 1995). Such interdisci- plinary societies are more likely to form where there are problems that are perceived as falling within the purview of more than one science or profession. The creation of the American Orthopsychiatric Association is one professional example, and the Society for Research in Child Development is another.
