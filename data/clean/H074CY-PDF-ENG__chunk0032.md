# What to Do After the Review

The biggest impact from performance conversations is often what

happens after the review. Too often, nothing happens: The review is an

isolated annual event and therefore has little real impact. But research

on behavioral change and the continuous improvement required for

innovation highlights the importance of setting goals and providing

ongoing feedback about progress toward goals.

Put regular follow-ups on the schedule.

Technology is lowering the costs of doing this. For example, a study

of programs designed to increase peoples’ savings ﬁnd that follow-

up text messages, simply informing the person of their savings rates

versus others, are about 80% as eﬀective as in-person meetings. Other

studies, in areas ranging from health care to voting to energy usage to

drinking habits, ﬁnd that these reminders signiﬁcantly aﬀect behavior

and improve outcomes.
