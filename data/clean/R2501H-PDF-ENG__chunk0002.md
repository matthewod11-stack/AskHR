Over the past 25 years executives have become fervent advocates

of learning, calling it an imperative, career insurance, and the only

source of competitive advantage. That enthusiasm is warranted: Today

the development of new skills, knowledge, and mindsets is critical to

most businesses’ key strategic eﬀorts—from navigating global crises

and unprecedented industry change, addressing the rise of generative

AI, and driving innovation, to attracting and retaining talent, building

inclusive workplaces, and making a positive diﬀerence in society.
