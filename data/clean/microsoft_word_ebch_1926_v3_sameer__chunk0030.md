ABSTRACT:

The purpose of this essay is to contrast and compare several theories of motivation and how they are applied to encourage employees to pursue their goals. The accomplishment of organisational goals and objectives depends on employee motivation in organisations and work satisfaction. Organisations that don't motivate their staff suffer far-reaching consequences, including despair, high employee turnover, and burnout, all of which can jeopardise their success. Motivation needs to be a top concern for businesses if they want to make their staff members their most valuable assets and maintain them. In an effort to develop good attitudes towards their work, the study offers organisations advice on how to create environments and connections that are beneficial to work. For this study, a qualitative strategy and a theory-based application were taken into consideration.
