## Developing New Research on Humor and Culture in Organizations

Ziv (1988), Koestler (1964), and others have hypothesized that the key cognitive aspect of humor, incongruity and its resolution, is very similar to the cognitive processes required for creativity. Speciﬁcally, both humor and creativity require that an individual momentarily connects two previously divergent or unrelated notions (or expectation systems) in a novel way. This might suggest that humor makes individuals more cognitively ﬂexible and more accustomed to making associations between domains that are otherwise not seen as related. Enhanced cognitive ﬂexibility might be similar to what Abramis (1992) and others have described in terms of ‘‘play’’ (Csikszentmihalyi, 1996; Murdock & Ganim, 1993). Physiologically, this might suggest that activation in the brain caused by humor primes or facilitates activation that is necessary for creative thinking (and possibly the reverse), although we are not aware of any research that has examined this hypothesis speciﬁcally. An interesting research study might examine whether humor that is topic speciﬁc is necessary for increasing humor, or if activation caused by humor more generally is all that is needed.
