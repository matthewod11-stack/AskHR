# 422 School Psychology

The therapeutic expansion spilled over into the practice of school psychology, albeit on a much narrower scale than the traditional psychoeducational assessment role for special ed- ucation eligibility. However, even the traditional role was broadened by the inﬂux of new scales, such as the Wechsler intelligence scales; numerous personality assessment mea- sures, including projective techniques; psychomotor and psy- cholinguistic scales; and the Binet scales, which were revised to a single form (L-M.). Their use was enhanced by the ofﬁ- cial recognition of learning disability as a special education category in the late 1960s.

The approach to practice was also expanding. The latter portion of the Hybrid Years was characterized by renewed in- terest in environmental inﬂuences on development and edu- cation. Child study expanded from its traditional focus on the child to a broader conceptualization of factors including the ecology of the school and family variables. School failure and child social and emotional problems were no longer viewed simply as failures of the child. Rather, such problems were also being attributed to teacher, classroom, family, and environmental factors.

The post–World War II baby boom quickly raised school enrollments and heightened the need for psychological assis- tance in developing special educational programs. Special education enrollments grew from 310,000 to 2 million during this period, increasing the demand for school psychologists. By 1950, there were about 1,000 practitioners, but by the end of the period the number had grown to 5,000. Practitioners worked primarily in school settings (public, private, residen- tial), with only a fraction working in nonschool settings or in- dependent private practice. With baby boom enrollments and mothers increasingly working out of their homes, day care and Head Start programs were established. As schools ex- panded kindergarten and other preschool programs, school psychology practice spread to those settings. School psychol- ogists continued to be in demand because they were per- ceived as specialists employed to assist the school system in sorting children into more appropriate educational programs and services and providing interventions and consultation to children, their families, and educators.
