Rank orders are easily used when there are only a few employees to rank, but they become difficult to use with larger numbers. Ranking the top few and bottom few employees is relatively easy, but deciding which  of  employees should be placed at the th and st ranks is more difficult.

To make this process easier, paired comparisons can be used. This method involves comparing each possible pair of employees and choosing which one of each pair is the better employee. An example is shown in Figure .. Practice using the paired-comparisons method by completing Exercise . in your workbook.
