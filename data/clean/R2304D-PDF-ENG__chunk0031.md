## HBR / Magazine Article / The Labor-Savvy Leader

and the underlying problems that give rise to them. Most executives

know surprisingly little about what life is like for their workers. To really

understand what they want, you also need to get out to the front lines

and engage workers directly in conversation.

While many union leaders want to see companies succeed, some are

indiﬀerent to causing a company harm. In that case, you’ll need to

ﬁgure out who else at the union you can appeal to. Build relationships

with union representatives who recognize that when companies thrive,

their workers also thrive.

Invest in training. Given how long unions have been in decline, your

company may lack the leadership skills necessary to build a relationship

with a labor organization. If that’s the case, invest in training.

Consider Kaiser Permanente, which, when it started building a labor-

management partnership 25 years ago, teamed up with union leaders

and invested in training managers, supervisors, union representatives,

and all new hires in how to collaborate successfully with one another.

That investment paid oﬀ—for example, in avoiding job loss when the

company transitioned to electronic medical records. Prior to forming

the partnership with the unions, Kaiser had suﬀered a decade of losses;

since the partnership, it has managed two decades of strong returns

while paying industry-leading wages. At times, relationships with the

unions have been fraught, like any partnership—and that’s OK.

To help steer your company through negotiations, whether smooth

or rocky, you should consider sending union and management

representatives to oﬀsite training programs together, to develop

everybody’s skills while strengthening their relationships.
