The Orchestrator Agent is specialized in routing queries to the most appropriate specialized

agents and managing the overall conversation flow. This agent analyzes user queries to

determine domain and intent, directs requests to the most suitable specialized agent,

maintains conversation context across multiple turns, and manages fallback strategies when

specialized agents cannot provide satisfactory responses.
