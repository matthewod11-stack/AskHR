# Feminist Approaches to Therapy

The term feminist therapy came into use in the early 1970s. The ﬁrst feminist therapists deliberately positioned them- selves outside the system in freestanding therapy collectives. One therapist has described the early days of feminist ther- apy as “raggedy, boisterous, know-it-all, risky, and heady” (Adelman, 1995). In those times, some volunteered their ser- vices without pay. Others raised funds to be able to offer therapy without charge or on a sliding-fee scale. Now, femi- nist therapy has for the most part moved beyond its separatist, grassroots beginnings and its underground aspect. Therapists who identify themselves as feminist therapists or who spe- cialize in women’s issues work in a variety of settings, in- cluding universities, public and private hospitals and clinics, private agencies, and independent practice.

Although there are a number of frameworks for fem- inist therapy, certain concepts unite feminist approaches to therapy. First and foremost is an ethical commitment to pro- moting equality and social justice. Other key concepts are at- tention to the social context, particularly to inequities in the distribution of power and resources; respect for diversity and cultural difference; valuing ways of being and social roles

associated with women; and a commitment to collaboration and power sharing in therapy relationships.
