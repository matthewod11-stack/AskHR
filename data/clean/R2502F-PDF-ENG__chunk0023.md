power advantage, intentionally set tight deadlines and emphasized the

need for quick responses. Her goal was to pressure her Vietnamese

counterpart, recognizing that his preference, typical of his culture, was

her moves by claiming that they were standard procedures in her

culture and that since they were negotiating in her country, the

Vietnamese executive should adapt. Through these power tactics, she

pushed the Vietnamese negotiator into operating outside his comfort

zone, which caused him to make mistakes and bad decisions. He

ultimately ended up making an unfavorable deal.

The best way to gauge your counterpart’s intentions is to make your own explicit, because this typically encourages reciprocal behavior.

No amount of cultural savviness will stop win-lose negotiators from

trying to use power-based moves—such as lies, threats, abuses,

power-based strategies to reach a favorable deal with their counterparts.

They rely on enhanced communication, trust building, emotional
