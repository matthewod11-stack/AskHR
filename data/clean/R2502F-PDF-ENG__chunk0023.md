## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

intelligence, rational decision-making, and creativity to help both

parties identify risks and opportunities and work together toward good

outcomes. This approach is easier to implement if your counterpart is

also a win-win negotiator, but it is often the best approach to get what

you want from a win-lose counterpart. Instead of ﬁghting ﬁre with ﬁre,

win-win negotiators change the game and use water so that no one gets

burned. That said, a win-win approach is not without its risks, because when poorly done you may come oﬀ as weak, desperate, or indecisive.

The ﬁrst eﬀort, therefore, of a cross-cultural negotiator is to cut through

the cross-cultural noise and zero in on intentions. Doing so will help you

anticipate and interpret your counterpart’s behavior and actions and

clarify your own. The best way to gauge intentions is to make your own

explicit, because this typically encourages reciprocal behavior. It can

also reduce your counterpart’s fears and resistance to the negotiation

and open a path for a more-collaborative process and superior outcome.

Throughout the negotiation, take care to explain your intentions and

continually probe your counterparts about theirs as well. It can help to

ask yourself two sets of questions:

What do my counterpart’s moves signal? Was that a win-win or a win-

lose move? Is it contradictory to or compatible with previous moves?

Does it make sense to me? Could I be misinterpreting it? Are any of my

counterpart’s moves unfamiliar or surprising to me?

What have my own moves signaled? When I say something I consider to

be positive, does my counterpart seem to appreciate it? When I raise a

sensitive matter, does the person seem to understand its gravity? When I

make a complex point, does the person seem to have grasped it? When I

say something negative, is my counterpart’s reaction appropriate to the

message? Is the person’s body language compatible with the discussion?
