indicators. An indicator is a behavior that, if displayed, suggests that the competency is present. In the example of the competency communication for a professor teaching an online course, one indicator is whether the professor shows up at the chat room at the preestablished dates and times. Another behavioral indicator of the competency communication could be whether the responses provided by the professor address the questions asked by the students or whether the answers are only tangential to the questions asked. As another example, consider the two competencies that define good leadership: consideration and initiation structure.11 Consideration is the degree to which the leader looks after the well-being of his or her followers. Initiating structure is the de- gree to which the leader lays out task responsibilities. Five indicators whose presence would indicate the existence of the consideration competency are the following:

- Supports subordinates’ projects • Asks about the well-being of employees’ lives outside of work • Encourages subordinates to reach their established goals • Gets to know employees personally • Shows respect for employees’ work and home lives In describing a competency, the following components must be present:

- 1. Definition of competency 2. Description of specific behavioral indicators that can be observed when someone demonstrates a competency effectively

- 3. Description of specific behaviors that are likely to occur when someone doesn’t demonstrate a competency effectively (what a competency is not)

- 4. List of suggestions for developing the competency in question12

Using the competency consideration, let’s discuss the four essential elements in describing a competency. We defined consideration: it is the degree to which a leader shows concern and respect for followers, looks out for their welfare, and expresses appreciation and support. Next, we listed five indicators or behaviors that can be observed when a leader is exhibiting consideration leadership. Leaders who do not show consideration may speak with subordinates only regarding task assignments, repeatedly keep employees late with no consideration of home lives, take no interest in an employee’s career goals, and assign tasks based only on current expertise. Finally, how do leaders develop the consideration competency? One suggestion would be to ask employees, on a regular basis, how their lives outside of work are going. This may lead to knowledge about an employee’s family and interests outside of work.

In contrast to the measurement of results, the measurement of competencies is intrinsically judgmental. Competencies are measured using data provided by individuals who make a judgment regarding the presence of the competency. In other words, the behaviors displayed by the employees are observed and judged by raters (typically, the direct supervisor, but raters might also include peers, customers, subordinates, and the employee himself).

Two types of systems are used to evaluate competencies: comparative systems and absolute systems. Comparative systems base the measurement on comparing employees with one other. Absolute systems base the measurement on comparing employees with a prespecified performance standard.
