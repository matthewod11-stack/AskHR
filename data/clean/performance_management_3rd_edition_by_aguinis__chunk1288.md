appraisal forms at the same time because, in such situations, it is difficult to ignore the ratings given to other employees.

- Leniency error. Leniency error occurs when raters assign high (lenient) ratings to most or all employees. In other words, leniency involves artificial rating inflation. As discussed in Chapter 6, leniency is mostly an intentional error caused by a desire to maximize the merit raise/rewards, to encourage employees, to avoid creating a written record of poor performance, to avoid a confrontation with employees, to promote undesired employees out of unit, or to make the manager look good to his supervisor. Also, recent research indicates that individuals with certain personality traits are more likely to be more lenient: those low on conscien- tiousness (i.e., individuals who do not always strive for excellence) and high on agreeableness (i.e., individuals who are more trustful, cooperative, and polite).11 Leniency is a very common problem in performance management systems. In fact, survey results suggest that leniency bias is believed to compromise the validity of the obtained performance ratings in more than three-fourths of all organizations implementing performance management systems.12

- Severity error. Severity error occurs when raters assign low (severe) ratings to most or all employees. That is, severity involves artificial rating deflation. As discussed in Chapter 6, severity is mostly an intentional type of error caused by the supervisor’s desire to shock employees, to teach employees a lesson, to send a message that the employee should consider leaving, or to build a record of poor performance.

- Central tendency error. Central tendency error occurs when raters use only the middle points on the rating scales and avoid using the extremes. The result is that most or all employees are rated as “average.” This is also an intentional type of error and is mainly caused by a supervisor’s desire to play it safe. One negative consequence of this error is that it is hard to make performance-based distinctions among employees rated by the same rater.

- Halo error. Halo error occurs when raters fail to distinguish among the different aspects of performance being rated. If an employee receives a high score on one dimension, she also receives a high score on all other dimensions, even though performance may not be even across all dimensions. For example, if an employee has a perfect attendance record, then the rater may give her a high mark on dedica- tion and productivity. The perfect attendance record, however, may be caused by the fact that the employee has large loan payments to make and cannot afford to miss work, not because the employee is actually an excellent overall performer. In other words, being present at work is not the same as being a productive employee. This error is typically caused by the supervisor’s assigning performance ratings based on an overall impression about the employee instead of evaluating each performance dimension independently.

- Primacy error. Primacy error occurs when performance evaluation is influenced mainly by information collected during the initial phases of the review period. For example, in rating communication skills, the supervisor gives more weight to incidents involving communication that took place toward the beginning of the review period as opposed to incidents taking place at all other times.

- Recency error. Recency error occurs when performance evaluation is influenced mainly by information gathered during the last portion of the review period. This is
