Supporting employees when they need it most.

Layoﬀs are never easy; they’re even harder when you’re doing them

right, by thinking about the people who will be impacted by job losses and insecurity. Adding in to the mix the diﬃculties of virtual

communication makes it even harder.

Yet, with the proper preparation, mindset, and body language, your leadership team can deliver diﬃcult news eﬀectively and

compassionately. When you deliver the message well, former employees

will feel supported and respected. Meanwhile, the remaining employees

will feel motivated to keep working because you made them trust the

company is going in the right direction.
