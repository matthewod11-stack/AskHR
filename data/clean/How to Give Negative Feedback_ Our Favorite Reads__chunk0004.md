The reason these conversations feel so

difficult for me is my socialanxiety. When faced with the choice of confrontation oravoidance, I almost always choose the latter. While I understandobjectively that feedback is necessary, in the moment, my innerimposter says that sharing anything

negative will result in

conflict. In this situation, I assumed my colleague would get upsetor react defensively. I imagined us reaching a deadlock instead ofa solution.Here’s what actually happened: I told my colleague I’d noticedsome errors on our project and had rectified them. To avoid thesekinds of oversights in the future, I suggested we create a system toquality-check each other’s work. Thankfully, my colleaguelistened calmly and told me they wished I had raised my concernssooner so that we could’ve troubleshooted the issue together. Itwas a learning moment for both of us. We spent the next 30minutes brainstorming solutions.Giving tough feedback is an art—and a difficult one atthat.

Different people often require different approaches,depending on your relationship and the power dynamicsinvolved. Despite these nuances, however, all feedback shouldbe

delivered thoughtfully and with the intention of helping othersimprove.
