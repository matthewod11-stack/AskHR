Perceptions of individuals with different occupations may vary considerably. Work outside home may provide both men and women with a direct or indirect experience of gender inequality in earnings, promotion, and work conditions that are not faced by people who are not currently employed (Davis and Robinson, 1991).

Occupational socialization theory (Smith and Rogers, 2000) claims that employed people are socialized within work environment through training, organizational culture, and workplace rewards. Therefore, employed people might be more socialized and more conscious of the cases where men and women are treated differently while performing similarly than, for example, students (Judge and Livingston, 2008; Paul, 2006). Employed people might receive more information about gender inequality faced by others or by themselves in the labor market that increases their awareness of gender inequality (Davis and Robinson, 1991). In contrast, students might have little or no data about such cases. They are thus less likely to be conscious of overall gender inequality than employed people.

Do retired people perceive overall gender inequality to a greater or lesser extent than students and employed individuals? On the one hand, based on occupational socialization theory, retired people might be suggested to perceive overall gender inequality to a greater extent than students and employed people because they have more experience and are more likely to have witnessed or heard about cases, which involve persistence of gender inequality. On the other hand, Davis and Robinson (1991: 73) provided a conceivable explanation for why this might not be the case for retired people and why the dimension of occupational categorization may prevail the dimension of age. These scholars argued that retired people may see gender inequality as meritocratic in a way that it is a result of gender differences in talent, effort, and educational diplomas rather than a result of gender discrimination. Accordingly, gender inequality is likely to be justified for retired people. They thus might unconsciously accept its existence.

In general, based on occupational socialization theory, which states that people who are currently employed are more socialized and, thus, are more sensitive towards overall gender inequality than students, employed people are hypothesized to perceive overall gender inequality to a greater extent than students. Since retired people may be more socialized than students and employed people, they are also expected to perceive overall gender inequality to a greater extent than students.

Hypothesis 2: there is a positive relationship between being employed or retired and individualsâ€™ perceptions of overall gender inequality.

According to relative deprivation theory (Crosby, 1982), a married individual may differ from an unmarried one in the relative value he/she places on various outcomes and characteristics of his/her marriage. The theory claims that while married individuals tend to value stability and harmony in their relationships, unmarried individuals are likely to appreciate independence and autonomy. In addition, some empirical studies showed that married and cohabiting individuals were less critical towards gender inequality than those who were not married or cohabiting (Cohen and Korchmeyer, 1995; Davis and Robinson, 1991). Based on relative deprivation theory, I thus propose that married individuals are less likely to perceive higher levels of overall gender inequality than unmarried ones.
