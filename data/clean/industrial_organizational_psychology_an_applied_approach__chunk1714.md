## Figure 7.6 Example of a behavioral checklist (police offi cer)

The obvious advantage of graphic rating scales is their ease of construc- tion and use, but they have been criticized because of their susceptibility to such rating errors as halo and leniency, which are discussed later in this chapter.

Behavioral Checklists. As shown in Figure ., behavioral checklists consist of a list of behaviors, expectations, or results for each dimension. This list is used to force the supervisor to concentrate on the relevant behaviors that fall under a dimen- sion. Behavioral checklists are constructed by taking the task statements from a detailed job description (e.g., “Types correspondence”) and converting them into behavioral performance statements representing the level at which the behavior is expected to be performed (e.g., “Correspondence is typed accurately and does not contain spelling or grammatical errors”).

When creating the statements for each dimension, one should carefully consider whether to write the statements in the form of behaviors or in the form of results. Examples of behavior-based statements for a bank teller might include “Properly greets each customer,” “Knows customers’ names,” and “Thanks customer after each transaction.” The obvious advantage to a behavior-focused system is the increased amount of specific feedback that can be given to each employee.

Result-focused statements concentrate on what an employee accomplished as a result of what she did. For example, “Distributed at least  Visa applications each month,” “Teller drawer was not short at the end of the day,” and “ Completed annual report on time.” Result-focused systems are tempting because they

evaluate employees on their contribution to the bottom line: Did their behavior on the job result in a tangible outcome for the organization? To practice writing behavioral statements, complete Exercise . in your workbook.

A problem with result-focused statements is that an employee can do everything asked of her by an organization and still not get the desired results due to factors outside of her control. These factors are referred to as contamination. In banking, a teller might not be successful in getting customers to sign up for Visa cards because the bank’s interest rate is not competitive. In law enforcement, a police officer might not write many traffic citations because she patrols an area in which there are few cars. In retail, a salesperson has poor sales because of her geographic location. For example: Two salespersons work in different locations, Mary Anderson sells an average of  air conditioners per month, while Tamika Johnson averages . Is this criterion free from contamination? Definitely not.

The number of sales is based not only on the skills of the salesperson but also on such factors as the number of stores in the sales territory, the average temperature in the territory, and the relations between the previous salesperson and the store owners. Thus, if we used only the number of sales, Mary Anderson would be considered our top salesperson. But if we take into account that sales are contaminated by the number of stores in the territory, we see that Mary Anderson sold  air conditioners in  possible stores, whereas Tamika Johnson sold  air conditioners in  stores. Thus, Mary Anderson sold an average of . air conditioners per store in an area with an average temperature of  degrees; Tamika Johnson sold an average of . air conditioners per store in an area with an average temperature of  degrees. By considering the potential areas of contamination, a different picture emerges of relative performance. As this example clearly shows, factors other than actual performance can affect criteria. Therefore, it is essential to identify as many sources of contamination as possible and to determine ways to adjust performance ratings to account for these contamination sources.

After considering the behaviors in the checklist, a supervisor provides an overall rating of the employee’s performance on each dimension. As shown in Figure ., employees can be rated in three ways: how they compared with other employees, the frequency with which they performed certain behaviors, and the extent to which the behaviors met the expectations of the employer.

Comparison with Other Employees. Supervisors can rate performance on a dimension by comparing the employee’s level of performance with that of other employees. It is important to note that when such scale anchors as “below average,” “ average,” and “above average” are used, the evaluation involves rating employee performance in comparison with other employees. Though this approach will reduce such problems as overly lenient or overly strict ratings, it potentially forces a supervisor to rate employees who are performing well as being worse than other employees.

Frequency of Desired Behaviors. Behaviors can be rated based on the frequency with which they occur. For example, we expect our production workers to follow safety guidelines. As part of our performance appraisal system, supervisors are asked to decide whether their employees “always,” “almost always,” “often,” “seldom,” or “never” follow the rules. As you can imagine, it is often difficult for a supervisor to distinguish between levels such as “almost always” and “often.”

Extent to Which Organizational Expectations Are Met. Perhaps the best approach is to rate employees on the extent to which their behavior meets the expectations of the
