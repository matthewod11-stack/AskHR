2.4 Intersection with State Laws: Protections Beyond the ADA Contrary to popular belief, although the ADA establishes a federal floor of protecting disability rights in the workplace, the interplay between the ADA and states produces one of two outcomes: more protection or less enforcement, depending on the state (Hoffman, 2023). Examples of such laws include disability rights law in many states, often through their human rights or equal employment opportunity codes and laws, which either duplicate, supplement, or surpass the ADA. To illustrate, the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) of the state of California provides even greater coverage because it covers employers that have at least five workers and covers more general and pervasive forms of impairment (Hoffman, 2023). The same case also applies to the Human Rights Law of New York state because to safeguard this right, the New York State Human Rights Law has provided protection of disability rights that also covers temporary disabilities, like in the case of pregnancy-related disabilities. Such states as Massachusetts and Washington also include the presence of a disability advocacy structure and an independent commission that prosecutes enhancement. Opinions will be held against, on the other hand, arresting can be ineffective in the states where there is a political opposition, insufficient funds, or institutional infrastructure. Some states are wholly dependent on the federal system, e.g., the EEOC, with little locally based help to handicapped employees (Jo, 2023). Also, the differences in legal interpretation by courts, local court facilities, and availability of pro bono lawyers add further diversity to outcomes. That variance in the law between states develops an uneven patchwork of disability rights enforcement throughout the nation, meaning that a disabled worker has their rights and access to the court system and the workplace greatly dependent on where they physically live (Leal, 2023). This has led to the fact that some people have access to a strong, positive legal environment, whereas other people cannot even make the most fundamental demands of the ADA. The legal basis of disability employment in the United States is detailed as well as intricate. Title I of the ADA provides a crucial framework, yet its substance depends on the regular enforcement of the EEOC, internal motivation of employers to comply, and favorable laws at the state level. The balance between federal and state systems usually defines the level of protection of the people with disabilities; this is why it is necessary to bring about more integrated and equal treatment through the ADA implementation at the national level.
