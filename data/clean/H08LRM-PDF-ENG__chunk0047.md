# learnings from your sabbatical.

Finally, don’t stay out too long. Many sabbatical-takers, especially those

between jobs, assume that they will have everything “ﬁgured out” by

the end of their time oﬀ: a dream job identiﬁed or a big life change

executed. While this is sometimes the case (remember Aarti?) more

often a sabbatical is an essential ﬁrst step to unlocking the next phase of

your life. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. It’s OK to extend your

sabbatical based on what you feel you need, but it’s better to reenter the

workforce wanting more than it is to resent yourself for not completely

transforming over the course of a relatively short span of your life.
