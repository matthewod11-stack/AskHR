## HBR / Magazine Article / The Uniqueness Trap

These methods, and their eﬀectiveness, are well documented in

management literature. Anyone interested in eliminating uniqueness

bias and other preconceptions that distort decision-making—which

is to say, anyone interested in running projects and organizations

successfully—should become versed in them.

. . .

It’s easy to understand why people think their projects are unique.

It stems from what Kahneman called “fast thinking,” which is

humans’ mental default mode. Fast thinking saves project planners and

managers the considerable eﬀort of ﬁguring out which class of project

a new undertaking belongs to, what the averages and extremes are

for that class, how those values translate into risk, and how that risk

may be mitigated. But very few, if any, projects are unique, no matter

how complex they are. Unless you accept that and invest in identifying

similar endeavors and learning from them, your own project will most

likely come in late and well over budget and underdeliver on beneﬁts.
