# ORIGINS OF SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY

Historical accounts of the development of scientiﬁc psychol- ogy place the origins of the discipline in Germany at about the middle of the nineteenth century. The ferment produced by British and continental philosophies of mind and the advances of research in sensory physiology provided the im- mediate context for the beginning of the new psychology. The pursuit of knowledge about mind and its processes has a history that is embedded in the history of philosophy. The late-eighteenth-century declaration that a true scientiﬁc study of the mind was not possible posed a challenge that was an- swered in the nineteenth century when the possibility of a scientiﬁc study of mind emerged within philosophy by the adoption of the experimental methods employed to study the physiology of the senses. The synergy of these nineteenth- century developments gave impetus to the “new psychology” whose history embodies continued efforts to develop and maintain psychology as a scientiﬁc discipline and to extend the methods of science to an ever-widening ﬁeld of inquiry within the discipline.
