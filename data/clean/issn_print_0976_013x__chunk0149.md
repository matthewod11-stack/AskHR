# ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION

Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is an essential aspect of entrepreneurship and strategy. It shows

the management's vision and guides the organization's efforts to develop new ideas that help

customers and the businesses that serve them. (Smith & Jambulingam, 2018). EO is an

organizational trait that reflects how "being entrepreneurial" is realized in organizations or

business units. The particular area of entrepreneurship is understood as indicated by risk-taking,

innovativeness, and proactiveness. EO refers to how these characteristics are manifested in

organizations or business units. (Covin & Slevin, 1989; Miller, 1983). To be more explicit, the term

EO "refers to the processes, practices, and decision-making activities that lead to new entry,"

with the dimensions antecedent to new entry being risk-taking, innovativeness, proactiveness,

autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness. (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). According to the conception

of Miller, Covin, and Slevin, EO is expressed in the standard variation of risk-taking,

innovativeness, and proactiveness. To be more specific, EO can be seen in the typical differences

in how these processes show up in behavior. Polites, Roberts, and Thatcher (2012) explain that

EO is a "profile construct" based on how Lumpkin and Dess think about it. This means that EO is

represented by how the dimensions of the construct are merged into an overall profile. Both

ways of thinking about the situation may be defended. (Covin & Wales, 2019).

EO is the behavioral predisposition of an organization towards creativity, proactiveness, and risk-

taking that contributes to organizational performance (Isichei et al., 2020; Dankiewicz et al.,

2020; Kramoli & Dobe, 2020; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Risk-taking refers to the proclivity of an

organization to undertake endeavors and engage in actions that entail an element of

unpredictability in their outcomes. (Kallmuenzer & Peters, 2018). A risk-taking attitude measures

a person's willingness to make choices regarding endeavors with a high likelihood of success
