## HBR / Spotlight / The Secret to Successful AI-Driven Process Redesign

technology allows human operators to simply type text commands into

a chat interface; users with no technical expertise can direct and debug

the system. Ralf Gulde, the CEO, calls it “the world’s most accessible way

of interacting with robots.”

What’s next? The convergence of gen AI and digital twins, already

underway, provides a glimpse of a future in which continuous process

improvement becomes even more democratic. Digital twins are used to

model complex systems—such as jet engines, wind turbines, factories,

and human hearts—and simulate their functioning with an accuracy

that allows users to remotely create solutions to any problems that

arise (and often before problems arise). Digital twins can be used to

make production processes more eﬃcient, improve quality, increase

operational performance, and create more-robust and -resilient supply
