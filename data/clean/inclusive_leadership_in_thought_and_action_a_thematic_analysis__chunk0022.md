forms of leadership have been confounded with those of inclusive leadership. Similarly, in research to identify inclusive behaviors, some researchers have instead focused on actions to create psychologically safe environments. Consequently, we cannot adequately distinguish between leadership ap- proaches to foster employeesâ€™ feelings of inclusion versus their comfort to take interpersonal risks and be their whole selves without repercussions. In this study, we focus on inclusive leadership and investigate behaviors de- scribed by leaders to facilitate inclusiveness.
