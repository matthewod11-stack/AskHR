# Conclusion

This chapter was intended to offer thoughts on studying the rela- tionship between personality and affect. The overabundance of studies correlating various personality traits with dispositionalized operations of affect attests more to the simplicity of thinking about this relationship than to the utility of conducting such studies. This body of research tells us much less than we need to know about af- fect and personality.

The primary source of difﬁculty is the disconnect between the stable (by deﬁnition) nature of personality traits and the transient, time-bound nature of affective states. Affect states, as states, change over time, and the changing nature of these states makes expla- nation by way of stable dispositions difﬁcult, but not impossible.

The answer to the conceptual disconnect, however, is not found in remaking state variables into trait variables. Correlations may be found between personality and aggregated mood or job satisfaction, but such correlations do little to help us understand the role of dispositions in explaining true affective experiences. Rather, we argue that the role of personality can be found by ﬁrst taking a thorough look at the complex chain of processes that link events to emotional reactions and emotional reactions to behav- ioral, cognitive, and attitudinal outcomes. This examination will ﬁnd that personality constructs of many different types have vari- ous roles to play all along the mediational path.

There are wrong turns to be taken here as well. We believe that one risk is the arbitrary creation of dispositionalized elements of
