# 266 PERSONALITY AND WORK

1975; Mortimer & Lorence, 1979), although Kraimer (1997) notes that the extent of this change is likely to depend on the strength of initial beliefs. Because an individual’s personality is expected to be more stable over time and situations, a PO ﬁt assessment based on personality (I am a conscientious individual, and this is a con- scientious organization) should not be expected to change dra- matically over time.

A second reason that PO ﬁt based on personality should be as inﬂuential as that based on values is that personality is proximal to behavior. Personality deﬁnes how a person prefers to behave, whereas values deﬁne what a person hopes to achieve. It is rea- sonable to assume that the former is more closely related to be- havioral intentions (and, subsequently, to behaviors) than the latter. Moreover, values are notably equiﬁnal. That is, there are many behaviors that could be used to attain them. Thus, simply knowing someone’s values offers little information on the speciﬁc behaviors they will use in a particular situation.

A third reason is the relative observability of personality and values. Judge and Cable (1997) note that values may be less ob- servable than personality, and therefore judgments of ﬁt by others (recruiters) may be more likely to be made on personality traits than on the less observable values. Kristof-Brown’s results (2000) support this notion.

Based on these considerations of stability, proximity, and visibil- ity, personality-based PO ﬁt should have at least as strong an inﬂu- ence on individuals’ attitudes and behaviors than would values- based ﬁt. However, a recent meta-analysis of the PO ﬁt literature suggests that this is not true. In a meta-analysis of ﬁfteen studies, Verquer et al. (2001) found that value congruence had stronger relations with outcomes than did other types of congruence, in- cluding personality. When compared with studies assessing ﬁt as goal congruence, personality-climate match, and congruence with core principles and characteristics, value congruence studies showed a slightly larger mean correlation with satisfaction (r = .24 versus r = .22), organizational commitment (r = .32 versus r = .21), and intention to quit (r = −.38 versus r = −.15). While these results combined other types of ﬁt with personality congruence studies, the results suggest that ﬁndings in the personality PO ﬁt domain may be weak.
