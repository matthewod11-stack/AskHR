## in the employee attrition data as effectively as decision tree-based methods.

Decision tree, particularly when pruned to avoid overfitting, showed competitive performance

but ultimately ranked lower compared to random forest. Pruning helps simplify the tree

structure and prevents it from capturing noise in the data, yet it may also lead to some loss of

predictive accuracy compared to random forest's ensemble approach.

In conclusion, the findings suggest that for predicting employee attrition, employing a random

forest model with proper hyperparameter tuning yields the most accurate results. However, it's

essential to recognize the comparative advantages and limitations of each method in different

scenarios. Logistic regression remains a straightforward baseline model, while decision trees,

especially pruned ones, offer interpretability alongside reasonable predictive performance.

Future research could explore ensemble methods further or investigate additional features to
