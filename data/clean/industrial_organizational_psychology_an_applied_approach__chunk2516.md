# Custom-Designed Inventories

Though most research on job satisfaction is conducted using one or more of the previously mentioned standard inventories, most organizations tap their employ- ees’ levels of job satisfaction by using custom-designed inventories. The advantage to custom-designed inventories is that an organization can ask employees ques- tions specific to their organization. For example, a local agency recently restruc- tured many of its jobs and wanted to tap how satisfied its employees were with the changes. To do this, they hired a consultant who designed questions that spe- cifically tapped employees’ thoughts and feelings about the changes. Using one of the standard inventories would not have provided the needed information. To learn more about custom surveys, read the employment profile of Heather King.
