Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ): A -item questionnaire developed by Mowday, Steers, and Porter () to measure three commitment factors: acceptance of the organization’s values and goals, willingness to work to help the organization, and a desire to remain with the organization. Although the questions tap three factors, most people using the scale combine the factors to yield one overall commitment score (Kacmar, Carlson, & Brymer, ). Organizational Commitment Scale (OCS): A nine-item survey developed by Balfour and Wechsler () that measures three aspects of commitment: identification, exchange, and affiliation. Sample questions include, “I felt like a part of the family at this organization” and “What this organization stands for is important to me.”
