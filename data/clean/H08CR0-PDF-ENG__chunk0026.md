## visibility meetings, the square footage of one’s oﬃce, access to exclusive

perks, or high-proﬁle assignments — can create a zero-sum mentality

when used to compare one’s relative importance to others. And when

high achievers feel they aren’t getting their due acknowledgment, they

can be some of the ﬁrst to bend the rules.

“Sue,” a client of Ron’s, faced this challenge when one of her high

performers came to her and said, “I’m frustrated that you gave Rick

the lead on the Midwest expansion project instead of me. I thought

you’d said you would consider me for it.” Though Sue felt defensive at

the implied entitlement, she remained curious and empathic instead.
