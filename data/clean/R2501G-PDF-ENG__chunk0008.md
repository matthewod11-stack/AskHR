## software engineers, designers, marketing managers, and search-engine-

optimization specialists—to run experiments. But that presents a

challenge. Drawing on our experience working for and consulting

with leading organizations such as Airbnb, LinkedIn, Eppo, Netﬂix,

and Optimizely, we provide a road map for using experimentation to

increase a company’s competitive edge by (1) transitioning to a self-

service model that enables the testing of hundreds or even thousands of

ideas a year and (2) focusing on hypothesis-driven innovation by both

learning from individual experiments and learning across experiments

to drive strategic choices on the basis of customer feedback. These two

steps in tandem can prepare organizations to succeed in the age of AI by

innovating and learning faster than their competitors do. (The opinions

expressed in this article are ours and do not represent those of the

companies we have mentioned.)
