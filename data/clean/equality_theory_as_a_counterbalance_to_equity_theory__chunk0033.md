as justiﬁcation for high executive compensation (e.g., Perel 2003; Tosi et al. 2000). However, such pay disparity might nevertheless be described as broadly equitable and eco- nomically efﬁcient by traditional tournament theory rea- soning (Lazear and Rosen 1981). Tournament pay structures apply steep wage differentials to differences in relative individual performance, with the effect of rewarding those at the top of the pay structure beyond their marginal contribution and others below their marginal contribution. The economic logic is that employees put forth greater effort as they compete for the top pay prize (e.g., many lower level employees competing for a few top management positions). Interestingly, the embedment of this winner-take-all approach in the political economy of the United States also helps explain the widening wealth gap between the top 1 % and the remainder of society (Hacker and Pierson 2010). This approach runs counter to the principle of existential distributive equality, which inherently minimizes rather than maximizes status differ- ences and by doing so engenders motivation through social cohesion rather than competition.
