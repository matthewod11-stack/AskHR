The workplace deviance scale created by Bennett and Robinson (2000) is the most commonly utilized. Other studies measured specific deviant acts such as incivility via behavioural identification (Rosen et al., 2016), police misconduct (Lim & Sloan, 2016), critical incident technic (Restubog et al., 2012) and police self-protective beha- viors (Helfers et al., 2018). Another tool for measuring deviant behavior at work as a whole is a scale developed by Aquino et al. (1999) as described by Nasir and Bashir (2012). Rahmah et al. (2021) study on work ethics at the police corps used unethical behaviour as measurement of deviant workplace behavior.
