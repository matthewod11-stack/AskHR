# Promoting “Scientiﬁc Case Studies”

In the early 1930s, Allport adopted a new strategy in his ef- forts to promote the case study. Employing more scientiﬁc rhetoric and echoing the prevailing view that the method was “unsatisfactory,” he suggested nevertheless that “the concrete individual has eluded study by any other approach” and re- marked that “in the future there will undoubtedly be attempts to standardize the case study in some way which will reduce its dependence upon the uncontrolled artistry of the author” (G.W.Allport &Vernon, 1930, p. 700; see also G.W.Allport, 1933; Nicholson, 1996). Toward this end,Allport and his stu- dents designed experimental studies of “intuitive” processes and attempted to improve the scientiﬁc respectability of case studies by addressing methodological issues related to the question, “How shall a psychological life history be written?” (G. W.Allport, 1967, p. 3). For example, Cantril (1932; cited in G. W. Allport, 1937b) showed that “optimum comprehen- sion and memory-value result from the use of general charac- terization followed by speciﬁc illustration” (p. 393n).

Allport’s(1937b) textreﬂected thischangein strategy.Un- like other authors of psychological texts (e.g., Stagner, 1937), who treated the case study as a clinical method, Allport treateditasaresearchmethod.Notingthatthecasestudy“has not ordinarily been recognized as a psychological method,” he described it as “the most revealing method of all” and de- voted several pages to six “suggestions for the preparation of a case study” (1937b, p. 390)—for example, “Deal only with apersonalitythatisknown”(p.391;emphasisinoriginal).He cited the work of several students relating to the ability to judge personality and to the most effective method of describ- ing personality. He discussed the “generalization of case stud- ies” in “the construction of psychological laws” (p. 395)—a “nomothetic” application that would bolster their scientiﬁc
