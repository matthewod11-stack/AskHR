## HBR / Magazine Article / The Labor-Savvy Leader

Set the ground rules. This involves “bargaining over how to

bargain.” Meet early with union representatives to deﬁne rules for the

negotiations—for example, when and how to use sidebar caucuses, the

frequency of meetings, how both sides should communicate with the

media and constituents, and whether to use subcommittees. Working

out these rules can make it much easier to get started and can shape

how later, more-substantive negotiations will fare.

This process can be diﬃcult. As we’ve seen at Starbucks and at some

universities, many younger workers demand open negotiations in

which the outside world can experience events at the bargaining table

in real time—via Zoom, Twitter, or the like. Old-school labor negotiators

may pull their hair out at the thought, but remember: Management

needs to experiment to discover new solutions.

Set the tone yourself. Many unions fear that companies’ management

teams aren’t interested in negotiating in good faith and would prefer

to delay and confuse matters for as long as possible. That fear

is valid, given the traditional playbook of many newly unionized

companies, so reassure your union representatives right from the start.
