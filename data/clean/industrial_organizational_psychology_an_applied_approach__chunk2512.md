## Guidance for the current project team and measures of success

The data gathered from executives are typically used to set the direction for the proj- ect, and input gathered from other groups along the way is compared with these data.

Another core group that is often targeted for research efforts is line managers. These leaders are typically closest to employees and have the greatest influence on the com- munication employees receive. By involving managers early in the process, typically through focus groups, we gain an understanding of their needs and challenges as managers, the role that rewards and other human resources programs play in their ability to attract, retain, and engage employees, and how their views align with those of executives.

Employees often par- ticipate in a major change effort through a survey. Input from executive interviews and manager focus groups are combined with data gathered through employee focus groups to develop the survey. The survey is then administered to either the entire employee population or a sample of employees. The more sensitive and impactful the change effort, the more likely the client will want to provide every employee with a chance to participate. We conduct surveys using a vari- ety of methods: Web, paper,

important to them. With this in mind, imagine that both Sally and Temea think their salaries are lower than they should be. Sally is a real social climber and thinks that salary is a measure of one’s status in life. Temea, however, has inher- ited plenty of money and works because she enjoys keeping busy. Although both Sally and Temea think their pay is low, Nagy () argues that only Sally would actually be dissatisfied. To understand these differences, Nagy () created the Nagy Job Satisfaction Scale, which includes two questions per facet: one asking

email, and telephone. Once the survey is administered and data are received, we conduct a number of statistical analy- ses to understand the data. We look at differences across demographic groups, create indices of items to understand “drivers” of employee percep- tions, and look for general trends in the data. Our analy- ses are then used to write a detailed report of the results, where we pull together all the data that have been gathered thus far on the project. We explain the points of view of executives, managers, and employees, and compare and contrast their perceptions on various issues.

Often, we follow an employee survey with focus groups. These focus groups are used to further explore issues identified in the survey, and can be used to test ideas for change or communication with employees. Another form of gathering additional data from employees is through pulse surveys. These surveys are often adminis- tered online to just a sample of employees and are brief in nature. Pulse surveys allow the client to gather quick,

“real time” data to gauge employees’ perceptions and understanding of changes and communication messages that have been introduced. These results are tracked over time to monitor progress that has been made within the organization as a result of a major change.

The most critical compo- nent of any form of research is the client’s willingness to use the data. Best-practice orga- nizations ask their employees for feedback on a regular basis, have a good track record for using the data, and constantly keep employees informed of the use of data.

If you are interested in con- sulting as a career and want to move up quickly, my advice is to start out with a small firm. A small firm typically enables you to be involved with a variety of consulting activities early in your career. You are likely to be more involved with project management activities, interacting with clients, and participating in some aspect of sales within a few months of starting.

A large firm sometimes has advantages over a small firm—more resources, larger

clients, more clients, and more colleagues. However, you may be involved only with producing deliverables for an extended period of time. The frequent client interaction and involvement in sales may not occur until much later in your career there. If you start at a small firm, you can acquire the client and sales experience needed to join a larger firm at a higher level, which allows you to progress much more quickly in the organization.

Sales is often an area that people coming into consulting are not comfortable with. In consulting, we look at sales as problem solving—we are helping a client solve a busi- ness issue. You first start by getting to know a potential client and work to develop a good relationship. During this process you learn as much as possible about the organization and its culture, vision, goals, and challenges. Once you understand the organization, it’s very natural to discuss ways in which you can help your client. Basic relationship building and problem-solving skills learned during your college and

graduate school career can be leveraged as you grow as a consultant.

Work hours is another area many people are con- cerned about in consulting. While there are certainly long hours, the work tends to come in waves, with several days or weeks of long hours, then several days or weeks of slow time. The tradeoff for this lack of predictability in work is that as a consultant, you are often involved in very challenging, engaging projects and are working with sharp, talented people. There also tends to be a great deal of variety in the type of work you are involved with, as well as the clients and organizations you are serving. Some of the most successful consultants are high achiev- ers who thrive in this type of challenging environment, don’t mind the lack of predict- ability, are willing to put in long hours, and have a good balance of deep technical expertise as well as an ability to think broadly in a variety of consulting areas. Good inter- personal skills and a strong customer service orientation are also critical.

how important the facet is to the employee and the other asking how satisfied the employee is with the facet.

Measures of Commitment Most measures of organizational commitment are relatively short and tap aspects sim- ilar to the three types of commitment mentioned previously: affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment. Perhaps the most commonly

used measure of organizational commitment is that developed by Allen and Meyer (). The Allen and Meyer survey has  items, eight each for the three factors of affective, continuance, and normative commitment. Examples of questions are:
