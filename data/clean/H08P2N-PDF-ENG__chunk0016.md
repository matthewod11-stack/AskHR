# Pay attention to non-verbals

If you’re not getting the direction you need from your boss verbally,

look to their body language and behavior for information. For example,

if you notice their energy visibly drops when you’re explaining how

you handled a disagreement, that might suggest concerns about your

approach—even if they outwardly say it “sounds alright.” Similarly, if

they keep glancing at a speciﬁc section of your report while saying “this

looks good overall,” follow up and probe deeper: “I noticed you spent

more time on the ﬁnance section. Did something stand out to you?”
