## Leadership Competencies At Xerox Capital Services

At Xerox Capital Services (XCS; http://www.xerox.com), identifying leadership competencies was the first step in a successful leadership development program. XCS is jointly owned by the Xerox Corporation and General Electric. The company specializes in financing, risk analysis, and credit approval and employs 1,800 people in the United States. A leadership development program at XCS was focused on high-potential future leaders that were currently in pre-management roles. An important step in developing training sessions was to identify the key competencies of leaders in the organization. This process involved senior managers giving their opinions about what was most critical for leadership success in the company. After a clearly defined list of 12 competencies was identified, a curriculum was developed that included readings and a specific course each week on each topic. In summary, XCS provides an example of the importance of identifying competencies and how the competencies can be used within the context of a performance management system.9

Process management is defined as the “ability to manage project activities.” For the same position, a threshold competency is change management.10 The change management competency includes knowledge of behavioral sciences, operational and relational skills, and sensitivity to motivators. Therefore, in order for an information technology project manager to be truly effective, she has to possess process management and change management competencies.

An important competency could be “communication.” This competency is defined as the set of behaviors that enables a professor to convey information so that students are able to receive it and understand it. For example, one such behavior might be whether the professor is conveying informa- tion during preassigned times and dates. That is, if the professor is not present at the chat room at the prespecified dates and times, no communication is possible.

To understand the extent to which an employee possesses a competency, we measure indicators. Each indicator is an observable behavior that gives us information regarding the competency in question. In other words, we don’t measure the competency directly, but we measure indicators that tell us whether the competency is present or not.
