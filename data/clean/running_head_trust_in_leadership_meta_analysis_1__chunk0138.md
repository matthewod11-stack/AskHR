styles, trust in the leader explained a greater proportion of the overall indirect effect with

performance and OCB compared to LMX quality. The exceptions were the relationship

between empowering leadership and performance and between the moral and benevolent

dimensions of paternalistic leadership and OCB; where LMX explained a larger proportion of

the indirect effect. These findings are interesting, especially as previous meta-analyses

comparing the mediating role of LMX and trust have generally found stronger indirect effects

between specific styles of leadership and follower outcomes via LMX compared to trust. In

their meta-analysis, Nohe and Hertel (2017) found that LMX was the strongest mediator

between transformational leadership and OCB. Similarly, Lee and colleagues (2020) found

LMX was the primary mediating mechanism for relationships between servant leadership and

a range of employee outcomes as well as between empowering leadership and job
