## valuable insights into our values, needs, and limits. Judging and

resisting them only escalates the feeling and increases your reactivity.

Consider writing down your responses to these questions. Writing

creates space between you and your emotions, allowing you to identify

meaning and purposeful next steps. Furthermore, research has shown

days can improve both mental and physical health, reduce anxiety,

and even boost job performance. If writing isn’t your cup of tea, try

leaving yourself a voice memo instead. What matters most is giving your

thoughts and true feelings space to surface without editing or ﬁltering.
