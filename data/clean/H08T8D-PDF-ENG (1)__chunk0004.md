## HBR / Digital Article / 4 Strategies to Help New Leaders Give Feedback

As a former C-Level executive turned CEO and executive coach, I’ve

faced this challenge ﬁrsthand and have supported many leaders in

navigating this critical phase. Here are four strategies to help new

leaders approach feedback with conﬁdence and clarity.

A few weeks into his new role, I met Barry*, a divisional CFO, for an

executive coaching session focused on helping him maximize his early

systems and roles, but also values, norms, informal power structures,

and hidden dynamics. Within each domain, ask questions about the

past (What’s led to this team’s success—or setbacks?), the present (Who’s

inﬂuential? What’s the team’s operating rhythm?), and the future (What

changes are on the horizon? What barriers exist?).

You’ll rarely have complete clarity, but after you’ve triangulated

perspectives across diﬀerent levels and sources, the picture starts

to sharpen. If multiple people are raising similar themes and

that is consistent with what you observe, you’re likely on ﬁrmer

ground. The goal isn’t to gather all the information, but to gather

enough to give feedback that is informed, contextualized, and
