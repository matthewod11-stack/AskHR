# Single-Group Validity

In addition to adverse impact, an organization might also determine whether a test has single-group validity, meaning that the test will significantly predict performance for one group and not others. For example, a test of reading abil- ity might predict performance of White clerks but not of African American clerks.

To test for single-group validity, separate correlations are computed between the test and the criterion for each group. If both correlations are significant, the test does not exhibit single-group validity and it passes this fairness hurdle. If, however, only one of the correlations is significant, the test is considered fair for only that one group.

Single-group validity is very rare (O’Connor, Wexley, & Alexander, ) and is usually the result of small sample sizes and other methodological problems (Schmidt, ; Schmidt & Hunter, ). Where it occurs, an organization has three choices. It can disregard single-group validity because research indicates that it probably occurred by chance; it can stop using the test; or it can use the test for only the one group and find another test to use for other groups.

Disregarding single-group validity probably is the most appropriate choice, given that most I/O psychologists believe that single-group validity occurs only by chance. As evidence of this, think of a logical reason a test would predict dif- ferently for African Americans than for Whites or differently for males than for females. That is, why would a test of intelligence predict performance for males but not for females? Or why would a personality test predict performance for African Americans but not for Whites? There may be many cultural reasons why two groups score differently on a test (e.g., educational opportunities, socioeco- nomic status), but finding a logical reason that the test would predict differently for two groups is difficult.

If we do not believe that single-group validity is the result of chance, we must adopt one of the other two options. As you can see, even though the third option is statistically correct, many legal and public relations problems may result. For example, if an applicant asks, “Why did I get one test and my friend another?” we could respond that African Americans get one test and Whites get another. Such a response, however, is provocative and ultimately may be counterproductive for an organization.
