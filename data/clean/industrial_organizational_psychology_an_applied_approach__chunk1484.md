# Diﬀ erential Validity

The last test of fairness that can be conducted involves differential validity. With differential validity, a test is valid for two groups but more valid for one than for the other. Single-group validity and differential validity are easily confused, but there is a big difference between the two. Remember, with single-group validity, the test is valid only for one group. With differential validity, the test is valid for both groups, but it is more valid for one than for the other.

Like single-group validity, differential validity is rare (Katzell & Dyer, ; Schmidt & Hunter, ). When it does occur, it is usually in occupations dominated by a single sex, tests are most valid for the dominant sex, and the tests overpredict minority performance (Rothstein & McDaniel, ; Saad & Sackett, ). If differential-group validity occurs, the organization has two choices. The first is not to use the test. Usually, however, this is not a good option. Finding a test that is valid is difficult; throwing away a good test would be a shame.

The second option is to use the test with separate regression equations for each group. Because applicants do not realize that the test is scored differently, there are not the public relations problems that occur with use of separate tests. However, the  Civil Rights Act prohibits score adjustments based on race or gender. As a result, using separate equations may be statistically acceptable but would not be legally defensible.

If a test does not lead to adverse impact, does not have single-group validity, and does not have differential validity, it is considered to be fair. If the test fails to pass one of these three fairness hurdles, it may or may not be fair, depending on which model of fairness is followed (Arvey & Faley, ). But to be used with complete confidence, a test must be valid, have utility, and be fair.
