# HBR / Digital Article / Jim Fielding, Ex-Head of Disney Stores, on the Struggles of Mak…

But I had a couple amazing hours in the day, including one independent

study hour, where it was me and one other student with the teacher

that was my refuge from all that. I just kept focused on, I knew that

there was life for me outside of Toledo, Ohio. I had some amazing older

friends, including a woman I talk about in the book, Amanda Miller,

who I watched get out and go away to school, and that became my drive.

I said, “I have to get good grades. I have to study hard. I have to learn.

I have to participate in clubs because I need to get scholarships and

I need to go away from here, because this place is not allowing me to

really explore and identify who I am completely.”

ADI IGNATIUS:

That touches on the power of an ally. The power of somebody who

connects with you for who you are and how that can be life-changing.

There’s a question from Mark in Chicago and it builds on that. What are

some tips for exercising allyship to the LGBTQ+ community?

JIM FIELDING:

The LGBTQ community, we walk hand-in-hand with our allies. The

entire gay rights movement, allies were a huge part of that process and

continue to be. For the queer individual, for the LGBTQ individual, I

talk about this term, inviting people in rather than coming out. Inviting

people into your story. It’s a vulnerability exercise and a trust exercise

when you identify someone who you think is going to be able to handle

your story and handle your conﬁdentiality and be honest with you and

be your friend.

It’s really on us as the queer individual to invite that other person into

our story, and then be willing to say to them, “This is how you can help

me.” And be willing to ask for help. I went too long not asking for help.
