the negative feedback. At this stage of the process, however, feedback is delivered too late and often in a punitive fashion. Of course, feedback delivered so late in the process and in a punitive fashion is not likely to be helpful.

Alternatively, negative feedback is most useful when early coaching has been instrumental in identifying warning signs and the performance problem is still manageable. Negative feedback is also useful when it clarifies unwanted behaviors and consequences and focuses on behaviors that can be changed. There is no point in providing feedback on issues that are beyond the employee’s control because there is not much she can do to improve the situation. In addition, employees are more likely to respond constructively to negative feedback when the manager is perceived as being trustworthy and making a genuine attempt to improve the employee’s performance. In other words, the manager needs to be perceived as credible and as instrumental in improving the employee’s performance in the future.36 Finally, negative feedback is most likely to be accepted when it is given by a source who uses straight talk and not subtle pressure and when it is supported by hard data. The supervisor must control her emotions and stay calm. If managers follow these suggestions, it is more likely that employees will benefit from negative feedback, even if employees are not particularly open to receiving it.37 Following these suggestions leads to what has been labeled “actionable feedback,” meaning that such feedback will allow employees to respond in constructive ways and will lead to learning and performance improvement.38

- 1. How is your job going? Do you have what you need to do your job? 2. Are you adequately trained? Do you have the skills and tools you need to do your job? 3. What can be done to improve your and your unit’s/organization’s job/products/ services?

- 4. How can you better serve your internal and external customers?
