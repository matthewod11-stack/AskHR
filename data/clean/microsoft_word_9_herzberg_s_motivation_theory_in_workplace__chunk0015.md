# Job Enrichment

This theory has given too much emphasis on job enrichment and has totally ignored job satisfaction of the workers. He didn’t attach much importance to pay, status, or interpersonal relationships which are generally held as great motivators. Keeping in view all these points we can conclude that Herzberg’s theory has been widely read and there will be few people who are not familiar with these recommendations. This theory provides valuable guidelines to the managers for structuring their jobs in order to include such factors in the jobs which bring satisfaction.
