## through a differentiated HR architecture.

Lepak and Snell (2002) differentiate between four differentiators. First,

knowledge based employment, when workers are both valuable and unique and thus have

the potential to contribute to the firmâ€™s strategic objectives. Such firms are likely to rely

on a knowledge based employment mode which emphasises internal development and

long-term employee commitment for this core group of workers (Lepak and Snell, 1999).

Second, job-based employment, when workers have strategic value but limited

uniqueness. These workers are also often employed internally. Although recognising that

these employees can contribute to the success of the firm their skills are widely

transferable. Thus these workers are hired to perform pre-determined tasks. Third,

contract work- these workers are neither strategically important nor unique. Hence jobs in

this bracket are often targets for outsourcing. Fourth, alliances/partnership- these workers

are relatively unique but are of insufficient strategic value to employ internally.
