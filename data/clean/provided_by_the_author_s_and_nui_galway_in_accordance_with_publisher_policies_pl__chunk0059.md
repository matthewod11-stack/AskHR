## some academic studies between exempt and non-exempt workers (Huselid, 1995) or

managerial versus non-managerial employees (Jackson et al., 1989). Tsui et al (1997) are

generally considered to be the first to distinguish between multiple HR systems within

organisations and the potential for these HR systems to yield different outcomes

(Legnick-Hall et al, 2009). Lepak and Snell (1999) developed the contingent

configurational view in the context of SHRM and demonstrated that specific HR systems

are unlikely to be appropriate in all situations but rather depend on the uniqueness of the

human capital. They differentiate between four categories (explained below) of

17

employees based on the uniqueness and value of the worker skill and their contribution to

the organization and argue that unique and valued performers should be supported
