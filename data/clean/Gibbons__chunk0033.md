### **[Reimagining leadership development for the AI age]{.underline}**

[Leadership development must shift from programs to continuous
transformation. This means embracing real-time learning versus periodic
training --- learning in the flow of work. It requires philosophical
depth versus technical skills --- wisdom over knowledge. We need
adaptive capacity versus fixed competencies --- learning how to learn.
And we must build collaborative intelligence versus individual
brilliance --- collective wisdom.]{.underline}

[The goal isn\'t to develop leaders. It\'s to develop humans who can
lead through anything. This will be based on embodying the following
changes:]{.underline}

1. [From programs to living laboratories: Stop thinking about
 > leadership development as an event. Start thinking about it as
 > continuous experimentation. Create living laboratories where
 > leaders can test new leadership approaches with real stakes, fail
 > safely and learn quickly, iterate based on what works in your
 > specific context, and build judgment through practice, not theory.
 > This isn\'t training --- it\'s transformation through
 > experimentation.]{.underline}

2. [From teaching to unlearning: The biggest barrier to AI-age
 > leadership isn\'t learning new skills --- it\'s letting go of what
 > made leaders successful before. This requires structured
 > unlearning of obsolete mental models, challenging decades of
 > leadership muscle memory, creating space between stimulus and
 > response, and building comfort with not knowing. The hardest part?
 > Unlearning success. Letting go of the very approaches that got
 > leaders where they are.]{.underline}

3. [From individual to collective intelligence: Stop developing
 > individual leaders. Start building collective leadership
 > intelligence. This means creating peer learning networks that
 > evolve together, facilitating cross-generational wisdom exchanges,
 > running human-AI collaboration workshops, and building shared
 > sensing capabilities. The goal isn\'t smarter individuals ---
 > it\'s smarter organizations.]{.underline}

4. [From external experts to internal discovery: While guidance
 > matters, the answers must come from within. This requires coaching
 > that enables discovery, not prescription. It means facilitating
 > insight rather than providing solutions. It demands building
 > internal capacity for continuous reinvention and creating
 > organizational self-awareness. Nobody can tell you how to lead in
 > your specific context. But the right partner can help you discover
 > it yourself.]{.underline}

5. [From simulations to real stakes: Learning must happen in the arena,
 > not the classroom. This means real projects with real
 > consequences, leading through actual transformation, making
 > decisions with incomplete information, and building judgment
 > through practice. The best leadership development is leading
 > through the challenge itself.]{.underline}
