## Organizational Events and Perceptual Variables

One of the most widely investigated relationships among the or- ganizational and perceptual variables in Figure 6.1 is the relation- ship between job characteristics and job satisfaction. Originally, Hackman and Oldham’s job characteristics model (1976) hypoth- esized that ﬁve core task dimensions—task identity, task variety, au- tonomy, task signiﬁcance, and feedback—would be linked to a number of psychological states, such as job satisfaction, and sub- sequent organizational events, such as absence and turnover. Re- search has indeed established that the attributes that Hackman and Oldman named are useful predictors of job satisfaction (Agho, Mueller, & Price, 1993; Ambrose & Kulik, 1999). Researchers have also investigated the relationship between job characteristics and perceived job stress. Workload, ﬂuctuations in the amount of work demanded at different times, and the amount of control or dis- cretion an individual has over the work process have all been linked to perceived job stress (Bromet, Dew, Parkinson, & Schul- berg, 1988; Perrewe & Ganster, 1989; Spector, 1986; Tetrick & LaRocco, 1987).

Company policies and procedures have been linked to both job satisfaction and perceptions of injustice. For instance, both organi- zational constraints (O’Connor, Peters, Rudolph, & Pooyan, 1982) and work schedules have been linked to lower job satisfaction (Ral- ston, 1989). Organizational justice studies are concerned with in- vestigating the perceived fairness of procedures and outcomes in organizations. As such, it is usually divided into two categories: pro- cedural justice, which is concerned with the perceived fairness of the procedures used to determine organizational outcomes, and
