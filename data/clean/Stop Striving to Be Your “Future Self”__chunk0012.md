# Stop Striving to Be Your “Future Self”

5/7

To demonstrate this healthier way of thinking, let’s return to ourinitial example. Let’s say you have your mind set on a dreamschool or internship, but you find yourself staring at a pile ofrejection letters. Instead of allowing that challenge to disrupt yoursense of self and make you feel like a complete failure, you can tryto accept and creatively make use of the experience. Think of it asa part of your story. There’s no honest way to escape such a thing,but there is equally nothing stopping you from using it asmotivation in your next endeavor. By weaving the experience intoyour self-understanding, you remove it as an obstacle to reachingyour future goals.This is a rather fine line to walk, and might more aptly bedescribed as a tightrope pressed against a razor’s edge. Thesimplest, and possibly quickest, way to shift our mindsets mightcome from recognizing the human “

positivity bias,” or thedisposition that we will generally be better in the future. We canrecognize this, understand it, and choose not to give into it. Wecan choose to accept that whether or not we meet theexpectations we inevitably set for our future selves, we have thepower and free will to decide how we relate to the art that our selfhas become in the present.
