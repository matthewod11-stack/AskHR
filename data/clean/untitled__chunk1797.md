## Theory and Practice in the Classical Period 307

melancholer (black bile). They were concocted by various bodily organs from the primal elements taken into the body from the heat of the sun, air breathed, and substances in- gested. The humors varied in their qualities along the two axes of hot–cold and moist–dry. Health required a balance of the relative proportions of the humors, and anything that interfered with proper coction of the humors resulted in dis- ease. Three types of madness were distinguished—phrenitis, mania, and melancholia. Phrenitis was diagnosed when fever and delirium were present. Mania was characterized by ex- treme excitement similar in the absence of fever. Melan- cholia was differentiated from phrenitis by lack of either excitement or fever and was usually attributed to an excess or corruption of black bile (melancholer). Melancholia could be engendered by psychological stress and could lead to serious physical illness and even death. (The term melancho- lia referred to a speciﬁc pathology now called depression. The term melancholy evolved to denote a wide spectrum of psychopathology.)
