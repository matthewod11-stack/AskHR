Thus, as Napier and Latham (1986) suggest,

employees often see no value in the performance appraisal interview and view it as another organisational intervention which does not, in reality, have a significant influence on their performance or development. Other research highlights that a boss's performance evaluation may depend more on unit performance than on observations of the individual employee's actual behaviour (Lepsinger and Lucia, 1997). Longenecker (1997) drew on a sample of 120

``seasoned managers'' from five large US organisations to explore the factors that cause managerial performance appraisals to be ineffective. He operationalises ineffective appraisals as those that fail to focus on the issue of management development and performance improvement. Table I presents the top ten causes of ineffective managerial appraisals. It is clear from this list that a well designed multi-rater appraisal system has the potential to address many of the weaknesses inherent in the traditional approach. In the light of the drawbacks and inefficiencies of the traditional interview- based performance appraisal and the negative perceptions that have been discussed so far, it seems appropriate to investigate another approach to performance appraisal than has heretofore been used. The 3608 feedback process does offer a potential solution to the problems outlined above (see, for example, Longenecker, 1997; Wexley and Klimoski, 1984). For example, ratings need not be inflated because raters are providing information anonymously and the confrontational aspect of the review is lessened because the manager does not have to carry out the review in an interview setting. It is not, however, without limitations and these will be considered later.
