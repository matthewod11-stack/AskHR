# Stage 4: Deployment

Once your application runs smoothly end-to-end, you can deploy to production.

Do • Progressively roll out your application • Set up infrastructure for A/B testing • Design user-friendly ways for human feedback • Update your offline evaluations based on production data • Iterate on prompts

Don’t • Replace your previous system right away • Consider your offline evaluations as static • Make a decision based on a single evaluation test • Do this 100% on your own. Experts (like Anthropic) can help!

“Using AWS and Anthropic’s Claude, we’ve built a solution that gives Dashers reliable and simple-to- understand access to the information they need, when they need it. This has cascading positive impacts on our users and the platform as a whole, and we look forward to expanding to new use cases in the future.”
