## methodologies to the core capabilities of generalized AI technologies.

The result is that they can generate far more intelligent and accurate

outputs in speciﬁc domains like healthcare and ﬁnance than would be possible for generalist AI models. For example, a specialized model

designed to assist a physician making a treatment decision must not

only know what aspects of a patient’s current clinical status and medical

history are relevant but also be able to identify appropriate treatment

protocols and the strength of the evidence supporting that protocol.
