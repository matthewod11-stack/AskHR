### **[The call to action: Three actions for tomorrow morning]{.underline}**

[1. Map what\'s changing and what\'s enduring]{.underline}

[Gather your senior team to examine what\'s shifting and what remains
constant. Create two columns: \"What\'s changing about leadership\"
(decision speed, sources of expertise, team structures) and \"What\'s
enduring about leadership\" (trust, meaning, human dignity). This builds
shared awareness without creating anxiety --- many leaders sense
something is different but haven\'t articulated what.]{.underline}

[2. Identify one assumption to test together]{.underline}

[Choose one manageable leadership assumption to experiment with over 30
days. Maybe it\'s \"senior leaders should have all the answers\" ---
test it by including junior AI-fluent team members in strategy
discussions. Or \"annual planning works\" --- try a 90-day sprint
instead. Treat it as an experiment with clear metrics, not a
mandate.]{.underline}

[3. Create a learning ritual]{.underline}

[Establish a weekly practice where leaders share observations about how
AI systems are showing up in their areas --- customer behavior, employee
practices, competitive dynamics. Ask: What patterns do we see? What
surprises us? This normalizes not knowing and positions your team as
learners navigating change together.]{.underline}

[These aren\'t about revolutionary transformation overnight. They\'re
about beginning adaptation with curiosity rather than crisis, building
the organizational muscle for continuous evolution through small,
thoughtful steps taken together.]{.underline}
