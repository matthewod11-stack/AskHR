### **[The leaders who shape tomorrow]{.underline}**

[We stand at an inflection point in human history. The age of AI will be
shaped not by those who master the technology, but by those who
reimagine what it means to be human leaders in an era of artificial
intelligence.]{.underline}

[The leaders who transform now --- who embrace the discomfort of not
knowing, who experiment with courage, who manage human potential in new
ways --- these are the leaders who will define the future of
organizations and the meaning of work itself. The question isn\'t
whether leadership must change. It\'s whether you\'ll be among those who
lead that change.]{.underline}
