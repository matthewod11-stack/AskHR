- 2. Insincere praise

It’s nice to be told we’re brilliant or insightful or thoughtful—but not

when it becomes clear, moments later, that the compliment is merely

the prelude to an ask. This is a form of manipulation—a misuse of the

reciprocity principle that psychologist and author Robert Cialdini has

identiﬁed as a lever of inﬂuence (“They were nice to me, so I should be

nice to them in return by doing them this favor”).

Try to resist this very human reﬂex, as it will likely only lead to future

requests. Thank them for the kind words, but feel free to decline. You

don’t owe them anything as a result of their compliment. “I’m focused on

other priorities right now,” you could say, or “Thank you, but this doesn’t

align with my goals.”
