# Are Other Employees Motivated?

Employees observe the levels of motivation and satisfaction of other employees and then model those levels. Thus, if an organization’s older employees work hard and talk positively about their jobs and their employer, new employees will model this behavior and be both productive and satisfied. The reverse is also true: If veteran employees work slowly and complain about their jobs, so too will new employees. The importance of this type of modeling was demonstrated in a study of  employees that found that employees who observed other employ- ees engage in antisocial behavior began to act in a similar fashion (Robinson & O’Leary-Kelly, ).
