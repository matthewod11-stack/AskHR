# Definition of Trust

Although most definitions of trust seem to have a common conceptual core (Rousseau et al., 1998), individual researchers have used different operational definitions, which has resulted in the measurement of potentially different definitions of trust. These potential differences have been recognized by scholars, suggesting that trust comprises multiple dimensions (e.g., Clark & Payne, 1997; Cook & Wall, 1980; McAllister, 1995).

2 A second distinction found in the literature is whether trust is a belief–expectation or a behavioral intention (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Al- though empirical research using the latter definition appears to be growing, our review found that almost all of the empirical research on trust in leadership to date has used the former. Consequently, trust as a belief– expectation is our focus. We did, however, include both of the definitions in our coding scheme.
