in the general field of business) do the same rating task with the same job description. Then, answer the following questions.

- 1. Are there any disagreements between or among the res- ulting orderings? If so, why do you think that is the case? 2. What can be done to mitigate any observed disagree- ment between or among the resulting orderings? After discussing some possible techniques to reducing dis- agreement, if there were indeed any disagreements, apply some of those techniques until 100% agreement is reached.

- 3. Recall that tasks listed in a job description can largely be divided into behaviors (i.e. how to per- form) and results (i.e. what outcomes should result from performance). In the job description you cre- ated, which of the tasks are behaviors and which tasks are outcomes? Are there more behaviors or more outcomes? Or, is there a strong balance between the two types of tasks? Whether there is such an imbalance or balance, do you think the observed (im)balance is justified? Explain. (cid:2)
