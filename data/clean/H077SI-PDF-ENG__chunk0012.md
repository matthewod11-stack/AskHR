## HBR / Digital Article / Quiet Quitting Is About Bad Bosses, Not Bad Employees

leader, they also assumed that the manager cared about them and was

concerned about their wellbeing.

Our research has linked trust to three behaviors. First, having positive

relationships with all of your direct reports. This means you look

forward to connecting and enjoy talking to them. Common interests

bind you together, while diﬀerences are stimulating. Some team

members make it easy to have a positive relationship. Others are more

challenging. This is often a result of diﬀerences (age, gender, ethnicity,

or political orientation). Look for and discover common ground with

these team members to build mutual trust.

The second element of trust is consistency. In addition to being totally

honest, leaders need to deliver on what they promise. Most leaders

believe they are more consistent than others perceive them.

The third element that builds trust is expertise. Do you know your

job well? Are you out of date on any aspects of your work? Do others

trust your opinions and your advice? Experts can bring clarity, a path

forward, and clear insight to build trust.

By building a trusting relationship with all of your direct reports,

the possibility of them quietly quitting dissipates signiﬁcantly. The

approach leaders took to drive for results from employees in the past

is not the same approach we use today. We are building safer, more

inclusive, and positive workplaces, and we must continue to do better.

It’s easy to place the blame for quiet quitting on lazy or unmotivated

workers, but instead, this research is telling us to look within and

recognize that individuals want to give their energy, creativity, time,

and enthusiasm to the organizations and leaders that deserve it.
