# praise to his employee.

After the successful completion of a three-month project at a large telecommuni- cations company, Ken, the manager, wants to congratulate Mike on a job well done. Ken calls Mike into his office one day after the project is completed.

KEN:

Thanks for stopping by Mike, and thank you for all of your hard work over the past three months. I know that I might not have congratulated you on every milestone you reached along the way, but I wanted to take the time to congratulate you now. Your organizational skills and ability to interact successfully with multiple departments led to the successful completion of the project on time and within budget.

MIKE:

Thanks, Ken. I have really been putting extra effort into completing this project on time.

KEN:

It shows, Mike, and I appreciate all of your hard work and dedication to this team and our department. Thanks again and congratulations on a great end to a long three months.
