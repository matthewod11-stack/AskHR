# covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Here are two cases involving bad-faith discharge. A breach of contract occurred

when a salesman was terminated after 25 years of service. The employee had a position

that was straight commission and closed a large sale for his company, then was later

terminated. It was determined by the courts that he was terminated because his employer

did not want to pay the large bonus. Second case, the courts found a forklift operator was

terminated after ten years of service, for not contributing to the employer's pension fund.

In the latter case the court looked at the special relationship that existed between and

and ''vulnerability and dependency" (Aalberts et al., 1993). The court holding focused on

the relationship of trust between both parties in that contract. In both of these cases, the

court permitted the case to stand on bad-faith tort and punitive damages.

Next, public policy tort is an exception to the at-will doctrine. As previously

stated a contract is not needed to prove culpability. First, determining what constitutes

public policy in the view of the court. Another factor to consider is that each state may

enforce different and or similar public policies. In practice, we can tum to existing case

law where the courts relied on statues, constitutions and precedents to determine public

policy (Aalberts et al., 1993). In addition a judge may use his or her convictions in

deciding the case. A case where the petitioner

took the employer to court for being

discharged on the grounds of reporting the misconduct of a supervisor to higher

management. The plaintiff argued under the whistler blower protection, that his

termination constituted wrongful discharge. Conversely, the courts responded this was

not a public policy violation and the conduct was reported internally and not reported to

the proper public agency. Here, the behavior of the supervisor was in question and the

plaintiff, while an employee was not being asked to break any law on the behalf of the

employer. If the plaintiff was being asked to break the law, the petitioner followed the

correct steps by reporting the behavior in question to an agent of the employer.

Moreover, to seek public policy protection the employee should have reported the facts of
