# growth and happiness.

One area I’m excited about is an apprentice program. We currently

have three live, a Butcher Apprentice program, a Certiﬁed Cheese

Professional, and a Bakery Decorator Apprentice. We’re going to be

rolling this out so each one of our departments and teams has an

apprentice program going forward. This allows team members to

develop skills and trades they can use at Whole Foods Market and
