## How to Use AI Wisely in Executive Decisions

Our ﬁndings carry some important lessons for leaders and

organizations as they integrate AI tools into decision-making:

- 1. Be aware of AI’s biases and the illusion of knowledge.

Consulting ChatGPT (or similar gen AI models) can subtly but

signiﬁcantly tilt your expectations and create excessive conﬁdence in

them. If you’re using AI to inform forecasts or strategic decisions,

remember that it might impress you with detail while lacking the

cautionary perspective that humans naturally bring. Hence, when

making predictions, specify the data you want the system to analyze,

have the system provide you with a statistical conﬁdence interval, and

most importantly (to compensate any bias), ask the system to explain

why or how the prediction could be wrong.

- 2. Don’t ditch human discussion, instead leverage it.

The contrast between our two groups underscores the value of peer

discussion as a counterbalance. Yes, AI can provide lightning-fast

analysis and information, but there is still wisdom in the room. Peers

can contribute fresh data, context, and a reality check on ideas that

sound too good to be true, or just too precise in their forecast. In

practice, the best approach may be to combine AI input with human

dialogue. For instance, an executive could get a quick take from

ChatGPT and then convene a team meeting to debate it. Our research

suggests that this combination would harness AI’s strengths and

human judgment, helping avoid the blind spots of either alone. As

leaders, encouraging a culture where new tech is used alongside healthy

skepticism and discussion will likely lead to more balanced decisions.

- 3. Critical thinking is key, no matter the source.

Whether advice comes from an AI or a colleague, executives must apply

their own critical thinking. Ask questions about the basis of a forecast.

In the case of ChatGPT, one might probe: What data is this forecast
