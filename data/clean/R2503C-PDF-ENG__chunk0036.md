## HBR / Magazine Article / Lean Strategy Making

functional leaders to decide how to evaluate competing strategies and

make recommendations.

Choices and commitments. In this session leadership reviews

evaluations of the alternatives, uses agreed-upon criteria to select

the best one, deﬁnes performance milestones for it, and identiﬁes

the resources it will require. The outcome of this meeting is a

ﬁnal decision, which includes committing resources in exchange for

expected performance improvements.

It’s surprising how often strategy goes oﬀ the rails at this juncture.

Nearly 30 years ago, Michael Porter observed that “the essence of

strategy is choosing what not to do.” Yet in many companies, it’s diﬃcult

to determine precisely what leaders have decided to do—let alone what

they have chosen not to do. After a typical board strategy review, the

answers to key strategic questions often remain unclear or open to interpretation. Strategic decision-making falters when critical trade-oﬀs

aren’t assessed and concrete choices are left unmade.

In many companies strategy resembles an elaborate description of a

desired end state, without a clear path for getting there. Such ﬁrms

rarely deﬁne what actions will be immediately stopped, continued, or

started. Without that clarity, however, execution becomes challenging.

Worse, strategies can face a silent veto in lower levels of the

organization, where employees may be skeptical of leadership’s vision.

In both cases, performance will fall short. A strategic plan needs to be

prescriptive and specify how to achieve the future it outlines.

The best companies follow up their strategy reviews by creating an

explicit decision log. It captures the choices made by leadership,

documenting the range of alternatives considered, the reasons certain

options were rejected, and the rationale behind the chosen path. This
