employees with five cards compared the value of their hands, and the winning employee would be given a prize such as dinner for two at the best restaurant in town or a gas barbecue grill. Although some studies have reported success in using such games, the meta-analysis by Wagner () found that the mean effect size for games was close to zero.

Time Off. Another approach is the paid time off program (PTO) or paid-leave bank (PLB). With this style of program, vacation, personal, holiday, and sick days are combined into one category—paid time off. For example, in a traditional system, an employee might be given ten vacation days, three personal days, five holidays, and ten sick days, for a total of  days. With a PTO program, the employee might be given  days in total for the year. An employee who is seldom sick has more days to use for vacation and is protected in case of a long-term illness, and the organization saves money by reducing the total number of unscheduled absences. As shown in Table ., human resources (HR) directors rate buy-back programs, paid-leave banks, and disciplinary action as the most effective absence control methods.

In % of PTO programs, an employee can “bank” time off to use at a later date, and % of organizations with a PTO program allow employees to donate unused leave to a leave bank for employees who are stricken by a catastrophic illness such as cancer (CCH, ). My neighbor provides an excellent example of a PTO in which employees can bank their time off. She works for a hospital and has not missed a day of work in five years. As a consequence, she now has three months’ extra vacation time, which she plans to spend with her newborn son.

Recognition Programs. One other way that we can make work attendance more rewarding is through recognition and praise. Formal recognition programs pro- vide employees with perfect-attendance certificates, coffee mugs, plaques, lapel pins, watches, and so forth. As shown in Table ., HR directors do not per- ceive these programs to be as effective as many of the other programs. Though incentive programs can be an effective means of increasing attendance, many
