## pay, the chances for advancement, the management, the work groups, and the

working conditions. Figure 10 by Rue and Byars offers a slightly different perspective

Fig. 10 Determinants of Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction (Rue & Byars, 2003, p. 259)

This study explains that every human has different intrinsic motivators directly

influencing person behavior and this has an effect on overall satisfaction. Therefore,

factors which influence job satisfaction can also cause dissatisfaction in a different

person. Herzberg's Two Factor Theory (Herzberg, 1993) is perhaps the most often

quoted perspective. In reality, the core principle is that workers' work environments

are influenced by two elements, one that plays a significant part in job satisfaction and

one that does not. Accordingly, all elements determined from extensive empirical

study have been categorized as factors that lead to job satisfaction (motivators) and

ones that cause job dissatisfaction (hygiene factors), Table 1.
