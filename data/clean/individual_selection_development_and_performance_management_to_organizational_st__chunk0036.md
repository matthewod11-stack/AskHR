# Development of Competency Models

After finalizing the benchmarks, questions are written for each competency to elicit be- havioral responses that can be tied back to the benchmarks for rating purposes (see Table III). This represents an application of the behav- ioral consistency approach, where past behav- ior is a good indication of future behavior (Schmidt et al., 1979).

The size of the organization should be consid- ered in determining the job analysis methodol- ogy. Larger organizations, like the federal govern- ment, should use survey approaches to collect job analysis information to achieve sufficient rep- resentation of the population, whereas smaller organizations or jobs with few incumbents may be adequately represented through focus groups.
