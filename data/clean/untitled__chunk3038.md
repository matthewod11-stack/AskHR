# Africa

The South African Psychological Association (SAPA) was formed in 1948. From its beginning, it incorporated both academic and professional psychologists. Conﬂict over apartheid led to a separate Whites only organization in 1961, the Psychological Institute of the Republic of South Africa (PIRSA). A new association of psychologists without racial restrictions was formed when the two groups merged to form the Psychological Association of South Africa (PASA) in 1983 (Dumont & Louw, 2001). At the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, membership in PASA was approxi- mately 5,000; 90% of PASA’s members were white. Other national associations of psychologists formed in Africa were in Zimbabwe (1971), Namibia (1990), and Uganda (1992).
