# Carroll’s Three-Stratum Theory

Today, perhaps the most widely accepted hierarchical model is one proposed by Carroll (1993) that is based on the re- analysis of (more than 450) data sets from the past. At the top of the hierarchy is general ability; in the middle of the hierar- chy are various broad abilities, including ﬂuid and crystal- lized intelligence, learning and memory processes, visual and auditory perception, facile production, and speed. At the bot- tom of the hierarchy are fairly speciﬁc abilities.
