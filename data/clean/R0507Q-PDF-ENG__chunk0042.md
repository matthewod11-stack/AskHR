## particular plant to an individual customer.

If the information system is unresponsive, however, it can be the

Achilles’ heel of performance measurement. Managers at ECI are

currently limited by the absence of such an operational information

system. Their greatest concern is that the scorecard information

is not timely; reports are generally a week behind the company’s

routine management meetings, and the measures have yet to be

linked to measures for managers and employees at lower levels of the

organization. The company is in the process of developing a more

responsive information system to eliminate this constraint.
