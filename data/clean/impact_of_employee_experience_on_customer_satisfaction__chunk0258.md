## Fig. 34 Leadership Index in three different markets

According to the author’s survey, leadership index in the European market is

significantly lower, ranked CLI=73 compared to US or China market. Specially Q28:

“Teams at my company collaborate effectively to get things done”, only scored 58 in

the European market, which is the lowest score in the whole survey. No average was

in the high end of the scale, and nearly half of people indicated dissatisfaction with

cooperation between teams. In the total score, only 22% of employees out of 105

responded to this question positively.

There is a strong statistically significant relationship between Q9:” I would recommend

my manager to the others” and Q28: “Teams at my company collaborate effectively

to get things done”

For statistical research, the author used ANOVA tests to determine whether the two

variables are statistically related, which typically means at least one group tends to

have higher values than at least one other group.
