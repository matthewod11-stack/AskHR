## HBR / Magazine Article / Redesigning How We Work

Companies have started to realize that the changes they’re contemplating to workplace practices and norms may be more significant than anything that’s happened in generations.

When I repeated the survey the following November, the percentage of

executives who reported having rolled out a ﬁnal hybrid-work design

had risen considerably, to 42%. Some companies are at last moving into

that phase, but many others remain in transition.

Why has this been so hard? Because so much is at stake. The new world

should come back to the oﬃce full-time, or whether two or three days

a week makes more sense, or whether employees should be allowed
