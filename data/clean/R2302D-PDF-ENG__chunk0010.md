## a period of uncertainty and transition, during which new assumptions

and norms take shape. Eventually they “refreeze.”

That’s what’s happening now, on an enormous scale. When the

pandemic hit, our long-standing structures, practices, and processes all

unfroze. Old ways of working fell away; we discovered new options for

remote and hybrid work; and as Covid restrictions eased, we began to

discern which of those options might be worth hanging on to.

We recognized that making sense of all this would be diﬃcult—and it

has been. In February 2022 I polled 266 executives from 68 companies

across 36 countries and asked them, “Where do you think you are

[with hybrid work] at the moment?” Only 2% chose the response “We’ve

implemented and rolled out a ﬁnal design of work.” The remaining 98%

located themselves somewhere earlier in the process by choosing one of

these: “We have a design and are beginning to roll out in some places”

(40%), “The ﬁnal design is still under discussion” (35%), or “We are

looking at options” (23%). Most companies, in other words, were stuck,

often uneasily, in the transitional phase: They had unfrozen old ways of

working and wanted the clarity and stability of a refreeze, but they just

weren’t there yet.
