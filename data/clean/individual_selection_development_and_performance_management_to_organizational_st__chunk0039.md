## Developing Competency Models for an Occupation

The competency model, or occupational pro- file, for each occupation for which there are sufficient data is based on the ratings of im- portance by supervisors and incumbents as

well as ratings by supervisors of the require- ment that individuals have that competency upon entry into the job. Competency models are also formed for several levels of each oc- cupation (e.g., entry into the occupation, in- termediate, full performing/journey). These competency models are intended for use by HR professionals and line managers to inform their daily HR activities by providing a sound basis for their decisions. The key to the suc- cess of this effort is to make this large data- base easily accessible by providing informa- tion in an automated format.
