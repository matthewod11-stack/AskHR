artisan cheeses we have in place. Current favorites right now are

Uplands and Jasper Hill as far as producers. The Harbison is actually

one of my personal favorites. In our prepared foods, I hit the salad bar

almost daily for lunch. And in center store, I’m always trying to check

out whatever store I’m in, what are the local products? Local is a really

important part of Whole Foods Market, so I love discovering new local

favorites in whatever store I’m at.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I assume your certiﬁed cheese professional gets a little nervous when

you walk up and ask what they’ve got?

JASON BUECHEL:

Not at all, because they know that I’m excited about a great conversation

we’re going to have on some of their favorites. And usually it involves

tasting a few samples as well, so always a great experience.

ADI IGNATIUS:

All right, well Jason, I want to thank you for being on the show. It’s really

great to hear your thoughts, and thank you for being here.

JASON BUECHEL:

Thanks for having me.
