the executives found it signiﬁcantly easier to gain insight into a

ﬁrm’s strategy if its framework was presented in a predominantly

horizontal fashion. This eﬀect was strong, and it probably reﬂects the

context humans evolved in again: Landscapes are horizontal. So it’s not

surprising that our horizontal peripheral vision is 180 degrees, whereas

our vertical peripheral vision is only about 135 degrees.

Indeed, research on visual cortex sensitivity pioneered by David Hubel

and Torsten N. Wiesel, who received the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology

or Medicine (shared with Roger Sperry) for this work, revealed that the

neurons in our visual cortex are more attuned to horizontal orientations

than to other orientations. Horizontal layouts, therefore, are easier for
