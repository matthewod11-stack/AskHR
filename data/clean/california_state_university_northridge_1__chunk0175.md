# action and causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action

("EEOC Compliance Manual" 1998). Here the EEOC recognizes there are employees

filing a claim as the charging party (CP) and the agent of the employer as the respondent

(R). The EEOC is seeking evidence to determine if the charging party communicated

directly or indirectly to the respondent or another covered party that the actions in

questions was a violation of age discrimination employment act, equal pay act or

American with Disability. A follow up question deals with the reasonableness of the

61

opposition and if was not reasonable, then the charging party is not protected ("EEOC

Compliance Manual" 1998). Along the lines of reason, the question becomes did the

charging party have good faith to believe the opposed practice violated discrimination

laws? If this is the case, the charging party is protected against retaliation. If the charging

party filed a complaint as a result and participated in any investigation of statutes enforced

by the EEOC, again the charging party is protected.

In the matter of adverse action the focus shifts to the respond and any action taken

as a result of charges by the charging party. Here, the question becomes did responded

give an unfavorable reference to a potential employer and did the employee end their

employment? The EEOC is seeking evidence from the respondent that his or her action

was motivated as a direct result of the charging party actions. Now with e-mail widely

used, it is possible that the intent of the respondent adverse action may have been

transmitted to another person whom they feel comfortable with disc11ssing snch matters.

The third element is based on the direct and indirect action taken by the charging
