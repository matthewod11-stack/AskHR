but he saw an opportunity to use AI to predict and score the fraud risk

of each positive result using machine learning. Transactions with low

fraud probabilities could simply be put in a “cooler” for several months

to see if they recurred with the same customer. Machine-learning based

AI systems to detect outliers are well-established in the fraud detection

arena. But when the machine learning system was combined with a
