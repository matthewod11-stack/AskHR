{not textbook organizations or those featured tn the latest best sellers or videotapes) have long suspected that social and political skills are the real key to getting ahead, to being successful Our study lends support to the latter view

The solution ts obvious, but may be virtually impossi- ble to implement, at least in the short run Tying formal rewards — and especially promotions — to performance tsa must if organizations are going to move ahead and become more productive Ata minimum, and most pragmatically in the short run, organizations must move to a performance- based appraisal system Managers that are effective should be promoted In the long run organizations must develop

Since there was sucha difference between successful and effective managers ir our study, we naturally found relatively few (less than 10% of our sample) that were both

among the top third of succ essful managers and the top third of effective managers Not surprisingly, upon examining this special group, we found that their activities were very similar

to real managers as a whole. They were not like either the

cultural values that support and reward effective perform-

ance. not just successful socializing and politicking. This goes hand-in-hand with the current attention given to corporate citure and how to change tt An appropriate goal for cul- tural change in today's organizattons might simply be to make effective managers successful

successful or effective real managers. Rather, it seems that real managers who are bath successtul and effective use a fairly balanced approach m terms of their activities. In other words, real managers who can strike the delicate balance between all four managerial activities may be able to get ahead as well as get the job done

important is the fact that we found so few real man-

agers that were both successful and effective This supports our findings on the difference between successful and effec-

tive real managers, but limits any generalizations that can be made about successful and effective managers It seems that more important tn explaining our organizations’ present

performance problems, and what to do about them, are the implications of the wide disparity between successful and effective real managers

Besides the implications for performance-based appraisals and organizational culture that came out of the findings of our study 1s a lesson that we can learn from the etfective real managers themselves. This lesson ts the mpor- tance they give and effort they devote to the human- ouented activities of Communicating and human resource management. How human resources are managed — keep- ing them informed, communicating with them, paying attention to them, reinforcing them, resolving their conflicts, training/developing them — all contribute directly to managerial effectiveness

The disparity our study found between successful and effective real managers has important implications for the performance problems facing today’s organizations. While we must move ahead on all fronts in our search for sclutions to these problems, we believe the activities basic to the effective real managers in our study —- communication and human resource management — deserve special attenton.
