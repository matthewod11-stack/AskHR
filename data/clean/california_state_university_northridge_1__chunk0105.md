Lawyers are now using electronic mail ( e-mail), as evidence in wrongful

termination cases. E~mail is an area where agents of the employer are providing expressly

supporting documentation of the direct violations of how that can be used against them in

a court of Jaw. The problem with e-mail is that all uses communicate informally, as if

scheduling gatherings after work or stating their opinion about key management

employees, he or she could be terminated for violation of e-mail policy.
