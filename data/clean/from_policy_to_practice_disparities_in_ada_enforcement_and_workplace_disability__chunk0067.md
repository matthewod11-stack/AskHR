disabled teacher in Kentucky who was driven out of the job after he asked to get a medical leave to undergo surgery went through the process of 9 months before the mediation process started. The complaint went to a settlement, but the complainant adds: The system was not assistive to me- it only made me tired." Litigation is more formal, more influential, and therefore costly and time-consuming. The majority have neither the financial nor emotional strength to follow it. Analysis of EEOC statistics shows that of all ADA complaints, only a very small percentage achieve federal court, at approximately 3 percent (McGowan et al., 2025). However, once undertaken, most of them would lead to upholding plaintiffs and establishing vital precedents. In Illinois, a groundbreaking case was decided in 2022, and the employee won 500 thousand in compensation due to the refusal to provide screen-reading software to a blind employee. These discordant findings indicate not only the possibilities but also the prospects of the implementation of ADA using the EEOC system, especially where supporting systems are absent. 6.4 Case Examples from Different States The gap becomes clearer when one takes a comparative glance at how ADA is being implemented in the real-world conditions in various states. The case studies reflect the effect of institutional infrastructure and the culture of law and awareness. Case Study 1: Massachusetts – A Model of Proactive Compliance The state Department of Labor in Massachusetts works together with the disability rights groups to check the activities of the employers in the public and private sectors. An example was the case of a certain public university professor having multiple sclerosis, requiring a flexible work schedule (Taylor et al., 2024). The university not only granted her request but also provided institution-wide training that would avoid oversight in the future. The employee informed that legal assistance was provided, and the procedure was fairly easy and dignified. Case Study 2: Texas – Uneven Compliance Based on Industry and Region The case is different in Texas. An Austin-based software engineer provided people with all the necessities to work remotely and ergonomic gear. In the meantime, an employee of a food service working in rural West Texas was terminated because they revealed a mental health problem (Goddard et al., 2024). She approached the Texas Workforce Commission to report the complaint, but this was to no avail. Such a difference between two entities in one state is an indication of the urban-rural divide and the urban impact of the local support networks. Case Study 3: Alabama – Structural Barriers to Enforcement In the state of Alabama, a vocational rehabilitation counselor who happened to have a mobility impairment was even refused permission to request the installation of an elevator, even though he works in a multi-story government building (Litor, 2022). The state used budgetary reasons. Months later, the counselor quit and found a firm in Georgia that provided everything to her. This
