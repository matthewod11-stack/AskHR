At the present, this is only a hypothetical. With few exceptions (Harrison et al., 1996; Sturman & Trevor, 2001), there is little research looking at the consequences of performance trends. When using some sort of lagged performance model, researchers need to give careful consideration to the potential effects associated with performance trends. This is a potential concern in many areas of human resource research, but perhaps most so in the areas of compensation and training. In compensation, rewards are commonly associated with more than just the most recent performance evaluation; if estimating the effects of a training program, controlling for the trajectory of performance scores may be essential for isolating the effects associated with the training intervention. Ideally, one should control for multiple measures of prior job performance to more fully specify any performance model, thereby gaining conﬁdence in any potential effects associated with an independent variable of interest (e.g., earning a certain bonus in time [t(cid:2)1], participating in a given training program at [t(cid:2)1]).

The question thus arises: how many prior performance scores should be controlled for in longitudinal analytical models? Unfortunately, the existing research on dynamic performance does not have a deﬁnitive answer. Simply put, more is better. If one can control for one instance of prior performance, the analyses will control the linear effects associated with job performance on the dependent variable, but it will not partial out the known non-linear
