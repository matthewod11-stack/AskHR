# improvement rather than destruction.

Leaders can help employees adopt this attitude by modeling and

celebrating examples of successful conﬂict engagement, sharing stories

of how constructive disagreement led to breakthrough solutions, and recognizing those who have used eﬀective strategies. A recent study

by our CIQ-Leadership research team at Columbia found that in

organizations where employees rated their leaders high on CIQ, the

overall culture was more collaborative and less contentious or conﬂict-

avoidant. In other words, the positive behaviors the leaders used to

manage conﬂict were being mirrored by the employees.

Today the question for leaders isn’t whether to build conﬂict

intelligence—it’s how quickly they can begin. In a world where change

is constant and complexity is rising, the ability to manage conﬂict eﬀectively isn’t a nice-to-have skill. It’s becoming a core requirement

for organizational success. Those who master this capability won’t just

survive the storms of conﬂict—they’ll learn to sail by them.
