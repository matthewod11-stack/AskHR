# Some Research-Related Implications

Our SIO model posits that cognitive, affective, and cultural factors affect the stigmatization of individuals in organizational settings. As a consequence, the same factors inﬂuence HRM policies and practices. Thus, we encourage HRM-related research that considers these factors simultaneously. With respect to research, several issues deserve attention. First, most of the research on reactions to stigmas of various types has been conducted using student subjects and scenarios depicting hypothetical targets. Thus, research is sorely needed that deals with stigmatization in actual organizations and involves job applicants or incumbents as targets. Second, cross-cultural organizational research is needed that assesses observers’ reactions to targets with different types of stigmas (Colella, 2001; Evans, 2003; Florey & Harrison, 2000; James et al., 2001). Such research should improve our understanding of the effects of culture on views about VSIs, ASIs, and a host of other factors associated with the stigmatization process. Third, research is needed to determine the relative effectiveness of various strategies for averting or overcoming the negative effects of SIO. Such research is extremely important because recent that stereotypes are over-determined; that is they are inﬂuenced by a conﬂuence
