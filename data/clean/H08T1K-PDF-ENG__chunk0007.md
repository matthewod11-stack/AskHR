# Find your footing

Before you say a word to your team, you need to process your own doubts and worries about the diﬃculties facing your organization,

Eikenberg says. “You might have a little of that ‘everything is falling

apart’ feeling; and maybe some of that’s true. But when a leader—the

voice of the company for a group of employees—is stalled there, people

pick up on it.” To ground your thinking, Lynch suggests turning to peers

outside your team and from diﬀerent industries to stress test strategies

and work through scenarios. “They will push your thinking, add value,

and help you make sense of the chaos in a way that’s more thoughtful,”

she says. Working through the gray areas out loud with your team risks

leaving them with unnecessary worry, she adds.
