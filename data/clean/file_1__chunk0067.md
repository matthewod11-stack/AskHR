# 2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

This chapter presents the theoretical framing of the thesis. I start by defining its essential element: gender. I then discuss the term ‘inequality’. Subsequently, by focusing on liberal feminist theory as one of the feminist gender theories, I introduce the ontological assumptions of the thesis. I also introduce main approaches aiming at analyzing gender inequality. Here I discuss the first central concept of the thesis – gender inequality. I then present its second central concept– gender pay gap. I discuss its magnitude and the main reasons for it. Furthermore, I introduce the term ‘perception’, the third central concept of the thesis. In this subsection, I discuss how perceptions can determine people’s attitudes and lead to different consequences. Based on the relevant theories, I describe how different factors are relevant for explaining perceptions of gender inequality and the gender pay gap. I conclude the chapter by examining how male and female employees react to pay differences.
