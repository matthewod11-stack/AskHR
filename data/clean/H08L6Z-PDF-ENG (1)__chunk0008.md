leaders whose teams would eventually use the campaign in their client

outreach. Sarah also wrote down the head of digital operations, who

rarely attended marketing meetings but still had signiﬁcant say in

getting the campaign launched.

- 2. Rate each stakeholder’s level of influence and interest.

Next, on a scale of 1–10 (10 being the most, 1 being the least), rate how

much authority or input each stakeholder has (inﬂuence) as well as how

much they care about what you’re working on (interest).

Sarah’s immediate boss scored high on interest (8), since the campaign’s

success would aﬀect his own performance review, but lower on

inﬂuence (4) because he needed buy-in from those above him. The

marketing VP had both high inﬂuence (8) and interest (8) and was

already supportive. The head of digital operations scored a 9 on

inﬂuence, but only a 3 on interest. The legal team ranked moderately on

both scales (6 and 5), while the ﬁnance director showed high inﬂuence

(8) but low interest (4). The sales leaders varied, with the APAC director

showing high interest (8), while other regional heads scored lower (3–4).

- 3. Plot stakeholders on a power matrix.

Quadrant 1 includes your key players — those who have both high

inﬂuence and high interest. Place those with high inﬂuence but low

interest in Quadrant 2. They have lots of sway, but don’t care much

about the day-to-day work. Quadrant 3 (low inﬂuence, high interest)

includes stakeholders who should be kept in the loop. Deprioritize

contacts that fall into Quadrant 4 (low inﬂuence, low interest).

Sarah plotted her stakeholders on the matrix:

- In Quadrant 1 was the marketing VP and APAC sales director —

champions who needed to be kept closely involved.
