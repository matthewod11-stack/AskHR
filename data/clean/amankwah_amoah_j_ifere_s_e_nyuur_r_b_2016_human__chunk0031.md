# Research context

In this section, we provide brief background information on Ghana and Nigeria as context

and in help positioning the findings. Since gaining independences in the last century, both

countries have emerged as leading forces in West African economic and political

development (Jackson, 2004; Serkin, 2015). They have a flourishing private sector,

experiencing economic growth. More importantly, they have been recognised as amongst the

most promising emerging markets of this century (Serkin, 2015). Over the past two decades,

African countries have recorded an unprecedented and sustained economic growth of 4.5

percent annual average. Beegle et al. (2016) referred to these growths as “remarkably robust”

especially when compared with the declining periods of the 1970s and 1980s when the

continent was perceived as deeply entrenched in poverty and endemic in wars and famine

(Beegle et al., 2016). This performance is stimulated by the institutionalisation of democratic

dispensations, liberalisations, and efforts at good governance which together have culminated

to the current focus on the continent as “Africa rising” (Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2016;

Beegle et al., 2016). Both countries have been among the favourite destination of substantial

FDI inflows into the sub-West African region over the years (Nyuur & Debrah, 2014).

Ghana and Nigeria gained independence in 1957 and 1960 respectively from the

British government. Shortly after this, these two countries recorded good economic growth

up until the late 1960s. However, spates of political upheavals in the form of coup d’état

contributed to the dwindling economic fortunes of these countries in the 1970s and 1980s

(Moja, 2000). Ghana’s GDP has been hovering around 7% per annum since the early 2000s,

only dipping to o 4% and 3.4% in 2014 and 2015 respectively, it is projected to recover and

record a stronger growth rate of 8.2% in 2017 and 2018 (Beegle et al., 2016). Nigeria is

projected to maintain a 5.3 % GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 despite a dip to 3.3% GDP in

2015 (Beegle et al., 2016). Ghana like other African countries is endowed with valuable

minerals, such as gold and diamonds and its economy has been reliant on cocoa, gold,

diamond and to some extent the recent discovery of oil in 2007 (Nyame & Grant, 2014).

Nigeria on the other hand is the world’s eighth largest oil producer and the economy has been

reliant on its huge oil wealth which still account for over 95% of the country’s foreign
