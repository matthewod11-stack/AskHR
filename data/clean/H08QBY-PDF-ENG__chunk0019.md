# Set legal and ethical ground rules.

The point here is to proactively address bias, liability, data governance,

and broader societal implications of AI-led work. To do that, you’ll

need to collaborate with legal, compliance, and ethics teams to draft

enterprise-wide standards for AI usage. These policies should deﬁne

whether and how AI learns from proprietary data, how to detect and

remedy bias, and how to safeguard personal or sensitive information.

If your enterprise is global, anticipate a patchwork of regulations

in diﬀerent jurisdictions. This is important: Ethical missteps—like

discriminatory hiring algorithms or data misuse—can ignite PR crises

and create regulatory liabilities. Many governments are moving quickly

on AI legislation. Firms that proactively create frameworks and foster AI

culture early will be able to adjust and react to future legislation much

better than ﬁrms who wait and are forced to start the process after any
