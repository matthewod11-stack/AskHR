## HBR / Digital Article / 6 Mistakes Leaders Make When Announcing Layoffs

They’re not clear on the path forward.

As a former CHRO and corporate executive, I’ve both lived through and led layoﬀs enough to know that successfully reengineering your business through staﬀ cuts only works when it’s one part of an

overarching strategy to create greater value. Make sure you’re clear

on that strategy and ready to share it before acting. Rebuilding

your business requires communicating a compelling vision that will

inspire your remaining employees to forgive any mistakes in business

judgment, set aside doubts, and recommit to your organization.

They don’t get the tone right.

Healthy human beings don’t want to inﬂict pain on others. It’s

understandable that leaders may want to distance themselves from

their own guilt or feelings of failure. But there’s a big risk in emotionally

detaching, ignoring, or downplaying the complex emotions, such as

anger, sorrow, and confusion, that your employees may be feeling.

Anticipate and plan for this. Envision how you would want to be treated,

and be that leader. Think through how you will respond if someone

starts crying on a call or is angry in a meeting. When employees leave,

“you want them to have felt cared for,” says Stopper.

or make excuses for the bad business situation you are in. Make

compassion a key driver of your approach. Be direct and take it on the chin. (CEO’s posting crying selﬁes expressing their sadness over layoﬀs

have not always gone over well.)

Your employees need to feel you’re there and that you care. Treat them

as intelligent partners who can understand the logic and rationality
