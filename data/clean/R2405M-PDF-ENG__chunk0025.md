“Yes, perhaps too smart,” Koﬃ said. “We have major concerns about her

plans—and about the way she told us about them.”

“How so?” Jean-Louis asked with lawyerly dispassion.

“Well, take sugar farming,” Yao replied. “We are a trading company.

What do we know about agribusiness? About the science of seeds and

soil? We have the land, but we’ve never done anything with it because

it’s totally isolated—we’ve been waiting for infrastructure to grow up

around it. We’d have to ﬁnd farmers to work the ﬁelds and build roads to

transport the sugar. It’s an enormous undertaking. And we’d be exposed

to drought and heat, which are getting worse with climate change.”

“What about her other idea, of selling power to the grid?” Jean-Louis

inquired.

“I’m not against it,” Koﬃ said. “I suspect we could get very favorable incentives and tariﬀs from the government, which has made reducing

the country’s power deﬁcit a priority. But Yao is very uncomfortable

with the scale of the investment.”

“Yes,” Yao said. “Power generation is about more than simply setting

up a few generators and connecting to the grid. We’re talking about

substantial infrastructure, ongoing maintenance, complex technology.

It’s just not our business. And the government may cap the retail price

for electricity. We could end up being paid less than our costs, meaning

we’d never recoup our capital investment.”

“I also can’t bear the thought of possibly losing Ibrahim,” Koﬃ said,

grimacing. “He’s been a loyal deputy for years; he knows the business

inside out. I’ve always assumed that Aminata would run a business division under him after Yao and I retired.” 5
