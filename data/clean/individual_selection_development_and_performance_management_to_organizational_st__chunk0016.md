# Traditional Occupational Analyses

- Studying groups of jobs at one time reduces time

- Studying one job at a time costly in terms of time and resources

- Studying one job at a time costly in terms of time and resources

- Broadly defined, general tasks are more enduring

- Tasks defined at a high degree of specificity are easily outdated

- Common set of competencies and tasks allows

- Very specific KSAs and tasks do not allow comparisons across jobs

- Very specific KSAs and tasks do not allow comparisons across jobs

- Facilitates integrated approach to human resource management (for example, serves as foundation for selection and promotion procedures, training needs assessment, performance management standards, and human resource planning)

- Not integrative; separate teams gather data for different human resource management initiatives (for example, selection and promotion procedures, training needs assessment, performance manage- ment standards, and human resource planning)

Using a common language developed based on a group of jobs allows a single sur- vey to collect information for multiple jobs and allows comparisons both within and across occupations in an occupational group. Be- cause tasks are written broadly to apply to multiple jobs in an occupational group, they are typically more enduring and encompass- ing. For example, the MOSAIC task, “Uses a computer or word processor to create, edit, print, retrieve, or manipulate files,” will be outdated far less quickly than the task, “Uses WordPerfect 6.0 to create letters.” This broad wording of the MOSAIC task allows for changes in the types of output and changes in technology by focusing on the main part of the task “using a word processor.” Addition- ally, rating the same tasks and competencies for all occupations provides data to identify occupations with similar task and competency requirements. This can be particularly useful for HR initiatives such as career transitioning, restructuring, and occupational consolidation. For example, in the federal government, people have traditionally remained in the same job classification and progressed in pay. The com- petency system helps focus on similarities across jobs, facilitating a career lattice ap- proach where people can move among jobs based on the competencies that they bring to the job.

The MOSAIC approach ensures that HR decisions are founded on technically sound

and empirically based information. The ap- proach provides the foundation for agencies to build integrated HR systems that use a com- mon set of tasks and competencies to struc- ture job design, classification, recruitment, selection, performance management, training, career development, and human resource planning. It also can ensure that employees receive a consistent message about the ele- ments on which they are selected, evaluated, and trained.

The MOSAIC methodology consists of several steps: review of literature and job docu- ments, development of competencies and tasks, identification of rating scales for the survey, linkage of tasks to competencies, de- velopment of competency benchmarks, and development of competency-based questions.
