According to the theory of resources and capabilities, coaching can give human resources

strategic value because the practice renders this asset rare and more inimitable, thus

transmitting a firm’s strategy to individual employees and helping them understand the firm’s

mission and values (Núñez-Cacho, Grande & Pedrosa, 2012; Pérez, Montes & Vázquez, 2006).

Thus, the competencies, capabilities and knowledge that are transferred in coaching

programmes, which are designed to serve a firm’s needs, have the potential to create

resources that are capable of generating a sustainable competitive advantage (Barney, 1991).

On the basis of the above discussion, the following theoretical framework of our research is

presented (Figure 1):
