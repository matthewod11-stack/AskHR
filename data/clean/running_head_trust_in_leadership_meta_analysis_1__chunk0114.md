# an additional mediator.

Comparing the two bases of trust first, any positive indirect effects were driven purely

by affective trust. Conversely, for each leadership style, cognitive trust demonstrated negative

indirect effects. Affective trust and LMX accounted for unique variance in the mediation

analysis. Which was the strongest mediator varied by leadership style and as a function of

outcome. In the case of transformational leadership, affective trust was the stronger mediator

for both OCB (.18) and performance (.10) when compared to LMX. A similar pattern of

results was found for abusive supervision as the negative indirect effect for affective trust was

consistently stronger for both performance (-10) and OCB (-.13). Overall, the analysis

suggests differential effects do emerge as a function of the trust base (Hypothesis 3).
