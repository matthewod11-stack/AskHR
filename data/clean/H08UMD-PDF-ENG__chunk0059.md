## on Google, Bing, and custom-built search engines and chatbots that

were designed to test speciﬁc interventions. In 2023 they added gen

AI tools like ChatGPT—which people are increasingly using instead of

traditional engines—to the experiments. Analyzing searches across a

variety of subjects, they observed that prior beliefs tended to persist

after a search, mostly because of people’s tendency to base search

terms on those beliefs. However, in one of the studies the researchers

developed a custom search engine designed to provide people with a

broader set of information. They recruited 1,002 participants to test

whether its results reduced the eﬀects of narrow, biased searches. The

subjects ﬁrst read a passage about the debate over whether younger or

older people make better leaders, which focused on people’s cognitive

abilities. Then they were instructed to use the search engine to explore

the relationship between mental acuity and age. The search engine,

without the participants’ knowledge, displayed one of two sets of

10 search results: The ﬁrst was based on the participant-generated

term, and the second was broader, combining multiple perspectives.
