take customer complaints seriously (despite statistical evidence from customer help-lines), because the

programmers thought the software was easy to use and couldn’t believe that customers found it difficult (a

“curse of knowledge”). So Microsoft created a screening room with a one-way mirror, so programmers could

literally see for themselves how much trouble normal-looking consumers had using software. The trick was to

use one judgment bias—the power of visually “available” evidence, even in small samples— to overcome
