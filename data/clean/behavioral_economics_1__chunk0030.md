# another bias (the curse of knowledge).

Experiments on rationality aggregation: Experiments are ideally suited to studying how rationality

aggregates. In an experiment, one can measure the degree of individual bias and market-level bias, and compute

whether biases in market prices or quantities is smaller than the average (or dollar-weighted) individual bias.

Anderson and Sunder (1995), and Camerer (1987) studied errors in abstract Bayesian judgments designed to

test whether traders would overreact to likelihood evidence (and underweight priors) when a small sample of

balls drawn from a bingo cage was “representative” of the cage’s contents. They found small biases in market

prices, which were reduced by hours of trading, but not eliminated. Ganguly, Kagel, and Moser (2000) found

much larger pricing errors when the event was a hypothetical word problem rather than a bingo cage draw.

Camerer, Loewenstein and Weber (1989) studied the “curse of knowledge” (mistakenly assuming other subjects

have your private information) and Kluger and Wyatt (2004) studied the famous “Monty Hall” three-door

problem. Both found that market trading reduced, but did not eliminate, mistakes. Maciejovsky and Budescu
