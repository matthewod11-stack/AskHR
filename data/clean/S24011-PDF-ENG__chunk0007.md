suggests. And by shifting the emphasis from learning on the sidelines to

leading in the moment, executives can achieve real breakthroughs.

This leadership model, which has become the basis for a popular course

at Columbia Business School, grew out of work that my consulting ﬁrm,

Mentora Institute, my team, and I did. In 2006 we began building a

repository of more than 1,000 moments of transformative leadership,

capturing instances when individuals notably exceeded expectations

Mastery, Outer Impact, in which I introduced the main tenets of

exemplary leadership and argued that leaders can embody them by

tapping into their inner core—the space of highest potential within

them, their best self. The presence within us of such a core—of a
