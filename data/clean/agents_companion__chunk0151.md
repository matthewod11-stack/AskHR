# discovery, registration, and “Tool RAG”.

- Flow / Routing: This governs connections with other agents, facilitating dynamic neighbor

discovery and efficient communication within the multi-agent system. This might be

implemented as a delegation of a task to a background agent, or handoff of the user

interaction to an agent, or the use of an agent as a tool.

- Feedback Loops / Reinforcement Learning: These enable continuous learning and

adaptation by processing interaction outcomes and refining decision-making strategies.

For gen AI agents this rarely takes the form of traditional RL training, but the performance

metrics of the past can be incorporated into future decision making.

- Agent Communication: Effective communication between agents is crucial for the

success of multi-agent systems. The Agent to Agent communication protocol facilitates

structured and efficient communication among agents, enabling them to achieve
