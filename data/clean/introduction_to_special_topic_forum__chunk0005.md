The topic of employee motivation plays a cen- tral role in the field of management—both prac- tically and theoretically. Managers see motiva- tion as an integral part of the performance equation at all levels, while organizational re- searchers see it as a fundamental building block in the development of useful theories of effective management practice. Indeed, the topic of motivation permeates many of the sub- fields that compose the study of management, including leadership, teams, performance man- agement, managerial ethics, decision making, and organizational change. It is not surprising, therefore, that this topic has received so much attention over the past several decades in both research journals and management periodicals. Whereas several recent articles have exam- ined how far we have come in researching work motivation, this special forum focuses on where we are going.1 That is, we ask the questions: What is the future of work motivation theories? What are the critical questions that must be addressed if progress in the field is to be made? What is the future research agenda? How can we extend or modify current models of work motivation so they continue to be relevant in the future? And where are entirely new models of motivation needed to further our understanding of employee behavior and job performance in contemporary organizations?

been. This introduction represents an overview of the field of work motivation from a theoretical standpoint and lays the foundation for the arti- cles that follow.2

The term motivation derives from the Latin word for movement (movere.) Building on this concept, Atkinson defines motivation as “the contemporary (immediate) influence on direc- tion, vigor, and persistence of action” (1964: 2), while Vroom defines it as “a process governing choice made by persons . . . among alternative forms of voluntary activity” (1964: 6). Campbell and Pritchard suggest that

motivation has to do with a set of independent/ dependent variable relationships that explain the direction, amplitude, and persistence of an individual’s behavior, holding constant the ef- fects of aptitude, skill, and understanding of the task, and the constraints operating in the envi- ronment (1976: 63–130).

These and other definitions have three com- mon denominators. They are all principally con- cerned with factors or events that energize, channel, and sustain human behavior over time. In various ways, contemporary theories of work motivation derive from efforts to explicate with increasing precision how these three factors in- terrelate to determine behavior in organizations.

To understand where the field is going, how- ever, we must first understand where it has
