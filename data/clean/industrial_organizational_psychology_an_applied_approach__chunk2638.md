and passed it on to others, and dead-enders were those who heard most of the information but seldom passed it on to other employees.

Managers tended to be liaisons because they had heard % of the grape- vine information and most of the time passed it on. Nonmanagerial employees heard % of the grapevine information but seldom passed it on. Only % of nonmanagerial employees were liaisons; % were dead-enders and % were isolates.

Although most people consider the grapevine to be inaccurate, research has shown that information in the grapevine often contains a great deal of truth though it is often incomplete. A review of rumors in organizations indicates that organizational rumors are about % accurate (DiFonzo & Bordia, ). Such a statistic, however, can be misleading. Consider the fol- lowing hypothetical example: A message travels through the grapevine that “the personnel director will fire  people on Monday morning at  o’clock.” The truth, however, is that the personnel director will hire  people on Mon- day morning at  o’clock. Thus, even though four out of five parts of the mes- sage (%) are correct, the grapevine message paints a picture quite different from reality.

The grapevine contains two types of information: gossip and rumor. While both gossip and rumor contain poorly substantiated information, gossip is pri- marily about individuals and the content of the message lacks significance to the people gossiping. Rumor, however, contains information that is significant to the lives of those communicating the message, and can be about individu- als or other topics (DiFonzo & Bordia, ). Usually, rumor will occur when the available information is both interesting and ambiguous. Thus, rumor serves the function of helping to make sense of ambiguous information and of helping manage potential threats, whereas gossip serves to entertain and supply social information (DiFonzo & Bordia, ). The most common top- ics for rumor are personnel changes, job security, and the external reputation of the organization (DiFonzo & Bordia, ). Rumor and gossip are often ways in which employees can relieve stress and anxiety, respond to perceived organizational wrongs in a nonaggressive way, maintain a sense of control, and increase their power in an organization (DiFonzo & Bordia, , ; Kurland & Pelled, ).
