Beyond these good and bad features, implicit bias also contains an ugliness. By focusing on individuals as the primary site for solutions, implicit bias depoliticises gender inequity, shifting focus away from the historical, social, structural, and political contexts in which those inequities are produced and maintained. For example, a limited focus on individuals engaged in paid work overlooks the inequitable division of unpaid domestic and care work that women do in the home and community and the resultant conﬂicts that can arise for women in the employment inequity cannot be sphere.12 Furthermore, gender separated from the wider context of class, race, ethnicity, geographical location, immigration status, sexuality, and countless intersections thereof.12 And yet, the intersecting nature of oppression is often overlooked in implicit bias scholarship in which the marginalisation of women is often projected as a universal experience, ignoring these other sources of inequity. Moreover, the binary approach of man/woman excludes non-binary persons from the conversation. Lastly, by focusing on the subconscious and unintentional nature of gender bias, implicit bias can overshadow explicit and intentional forms of bias that persist in academic institutions.2

A focus on implicit bias ultimately obscures the many interconnecting layers of gender inequity and hampers opportunities for meaningful and lasting change. Such change will require a suite of comprehensive interventions

designed to improve pay equity,13 facilitate more equitable and transparent hiring and promotion practices,13 expand mentorship opportunities for women,8 and inform changes to parental leave legislation,14 child- care policies,14 and ﬂexible work arrangements.15 Such actions have been successfully implemented in academic institutions internationally with evidence to support their beneﬁt for women. For example, multiple institutions have implemented ﬂexible work policies designed to support employees with family responsibilities, resulting in reduced work–life conﬂict.15 Organisations might also support participatory initiatives, leveraging the knowledge and experiences of a diverse and representative group of employees, particularly women, in the development and evaluation of institutional interventions and initiatives. For instance, Grada and colleagues8 showed that involving women academics in the development and redesign of organisational policies and programmes helped to challenge the individualistic and masculinised meritocracy of the institution, promoting more inclusive measures of success.8 Tackling the entrenched sources of gender inequity within STEMM is an important step on the journey towards addressing the challenges to women’s advancement. However, we must also question the culture, policies, and practices of the broader structures in which academic institutions are situated. Opening opportunities to discuss and dismantle implicit gendered assumptions, such as the naturalisation of women’s caregiving, is essential to promoting gender equity at the societal level, which will ultimately foster improved equity within academic institutions.
