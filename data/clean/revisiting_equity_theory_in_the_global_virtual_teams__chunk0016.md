Therefore, we aim to operationalize a new method to test wh ether the desire to achieve justice significantly affects GVT behavior and determine whether differences wit h traditional work settings exist.

PE and SE are critical to developing a performance appra isal method in GVTs. Self and e of ET, and in the peer performance evaluations are inherently subjective. However, at the cor absence of quantifiable input, the output –input ratio essentially becomes t he peer -evaluated contribution vs self-evaluated contribution. Hence, in the context of GVTs working on consulting projects, ET is left with assessing peer versus self-performance evaluations.

The protocol for testing these hypotheses is as follows:
