# Kretschmer and Sheldon

German psychiatrist and neurologist Ernst Kretschmer (1888–1964) presented a theory of personality in which he at- temptedtolinkpsychologicaldisorderstophysicalbuild.Inhis 1921 Körperbau und Charakter (published in English in 1925), he proposed three main body types: the asthenic (thin), the athletic, and the pyknic (stout). Based on observations of patientsinmentalhospitals,heconcludedthatschizophreniais linked to the asthenic, and manic-depression to the pyknic bodytype.Although,somestudiesofpsychiatricgroupsfound somesupportfortheclassiﬁcation,signiﬁcantcriticismspointed todifferentreactionsofotherstopeopleofvaryingbodytypes, and the effect of these reactions upon later behavior.

The basic idea behind his typology was developed more quantitatively in the United States by William Sheldon (1942). Sheldon also proposed a threefold classiﬁcation of components of body form derived from stages of embry- ological development: the endomorphic component, with a prominence of intestines and other visceral organs; the meso- morphic component, with a prominence of bone and muscle; and the ectomorphic, with delicacy of skin, ﬁneness of hair, and sensitivity of the nervous system. In an individual, each component is measured on a scale of three and a body type assigned by the three digits for each component. Sheldon proposed temperamental classiﬁcations to correspond to the morphological types. He published on this theme from 1927 to 1971, and in his later publications he reported ﬁndings based on a study of patterns of psychosis as related to physi- cal constitution.
