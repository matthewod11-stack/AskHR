# Eysenck

Hans Eysenck (1947) developed a typology of personality based in large part upon the Pavlovian model, together with

some elements of Jung. His typology was framed within the statistical factor-analysis approach then common in Britain, whereby temperamental factors were deﬁned as continua. Eysenck recognized three major independent continua or axes. The most basic was extraversion-introversion, in which extraversion was deﬁned as a balance where inhibitory activity dominated excitatory processes, and introversion was the reverse. The position of any individual on this axis could be determined by various laboratory measures and questionnaires. The other two axes were psychoticism and neuroticism, each of which was scaled from low to high. Any given disorder could be produced by the combination of mag- nitudes of the three axes. Thus, antisocial personality (the psychopath) was located in the high extraversion, moderate psychoticism, and low neuroticism; schizophrenia was located in the high psychoticism, high introversion, and moderate neuroticism combination. Most of the laboratory measures tested sensory and/or motor performance such as critical ﬂicker fusion, reactive inhibition in motor pursuit tasks, and the like.
