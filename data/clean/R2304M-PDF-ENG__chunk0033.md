I don’t think Puck should give up the whole oﬃce space. It has built a

successful culture, and working face-to-face enhances that. Productivity

went up when people went back to the oﬃce. Puck should consider

subleasing excess space or even sharing space with a sublessee on days

when its employees don’t come in.

That leaves layoﬀs, and at this stage I think a second round is absolutely

the right move. In fact, I’d tell Tyler to reduce Puck’s head count

by signiﬁcantly more than 10%. A minimum of 20% would be my

recommendation. The company’s burn rate relative to revenue is no

doubt too high, and most of that expense comes from people costs.

Making no change could mean running out of cash in a year with no

idea what the funding environment will look like. So Puck needs to

extend the runway—quickly.

This dynamic can be seen across the tech industry, not only at start-ups.

Facebook, Google, Amazon, and many others expanded head count

aggressively over the past few years and now have to pull back. If the world’s most proﬁtable companies are facing layoﬀs, Tyler and his team

shouldn’t feel bad about having to make them too. But communication

will be key. The leadership group needs to put policies (such as

severance) in place, clearly explain why the cuts are necessary, and then

work to motivate, engage, and develop the remaining employees—and

keep them excited about Puck’s future.
