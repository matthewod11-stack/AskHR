# Implementing Change

Another important factor in employee acceptance of change is the way the change is implemented. That is, how and when will details be communicated? How long will the implementation take? Does the organization have the right personnel for the change? What types of training needs does the organization have?

When organizations are planning change, they intend the change process to be linear in that they begin with Phase , move to Phase , and so forth until the change is complete. Typically there is an initial timeline for each phase. As you read the following “steps” to implementing change, it is important to understand that the change process seldom (perhaps never) goes as planned and that set- backs will occur resulting in the need to make revisions to the change process (Burke, ).

Creating an Atmosphere for Change According to Denton (), one of the first steps in organizational change is to create the proper atmosphere. This process begins by creating dissatisfaction with the current system. Employees should be surveyed to determine how satis- fied they are with the current system. If things go as normal, the results of the survey will indicate that many employees are unhappy with the way things are currently done and have suggestions for improvement. By sharing these results with employees, an organization can protect itself from employees reacting to change by remembering the “good old days.” Instead, they will focus on the “bad old days” and be more willing to change.

Perhaps a good example of this comes from some friends of mine who had been dating for several years. For the last few months of their relationship, each of the two would privately tell me how stale their relationship had become and say that it was time for a change. Jill made the decision to end the relationship and told Jack of her decision on a Friday night. The following week, Jill was energetic and enthusiastic, talked of dating new people, and even asked if I knew any good- looking single guys. Jack, however, whined all week about how good a relationship he and Jill had had and how he would never be able to find another woman he would love so much. What accounted for the sudden difference in their attitudes? Jill kept the “bad old days” in mind when she made the decision to end the relation- ship, and Jack remembered only the “good old days” after the relationship ended.

Some of this pining for the good old days seems inevitable. A colleague of mine had been complaining for years about his college president. The president eventually was fired and replaced by a new president who made many strange changes. It didn’t take a year before my colleague lamented about how much he missed his former boss. It took only a few reminders of the horror stories he had told me about his previous boss to quiet this lamenting.

After creating dissatisfaction with the status quo, Denton () advised organizations to work hard to reduce the fear of change by providing emotional support, allowing employees to vent and discuss their feelings, and providing employees with a safety net that allows them to make mistakes during the tran- sition period. Fear can also be reduced by having someone in the organization describe the benefits of change.

Communicating Details Employees are most responsive to change when they are kept well informed (Wanberg & Banas, ). Unless there is a need for secrecy (e.g., a merger), employees should be aware of and involved in all aspects of the change, from ini- tial planning to final implementation. If employees are kept in the dark until the very end, they usually suspect that something bad is happening. It seems to be human nature to think the worst when we don’t know something. After undergo- ing a major restructuring, staff at Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey, reported that poor communication was responsible for many of the difficulties encountered in the change process (Wild, Horney, & Koonce, ). During their restructuring, ETS learned these important lessons:

. Communicating change is hard work. Early in the change process, ETS thought it had done a good job communicating the reasons for and details of its restructuring. However, a change readiness survey that ETS administered to its employees indicated that many employees didn’t understand the change or were still resisting it. The survey
