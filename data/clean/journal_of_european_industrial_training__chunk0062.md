# By its very nature, upward appraisal

represents a significant change which individuals have to cope with, compared with the traditional method of appraisal. Bettenhausen and Fedor (1997) enumerate some of the problems encountered when introducing upward appraisal. Employees might perceive that upward assessment oversteps the boundary of what subordinates should do in the workplace and therefore upward appraisal can be perceived to undermine supervisor authority. Another possible concern is the view that it can create ``popularity contests'' whereby individuals attempt to score points with raters by being ``nice'' to them (McEvoy and Buller, 1987; Fedor and Bettenhausen, 1989; Cardy and Dobbins, 1994). Some managers perceive that subordinates lack the expertise to rate their performance accurately (Bernardin and Beatty, 1987).

While there are many espoused advantages associated with the use of upward appraisal, fundamental drawbacks which negate any benefits may exist. One of the main concerns for organisations using, or contemplating the adoption of, upward appraisal is the effect

that it may have on employee attitudes and morale. Furthermore, the issue of survey fatigue is problematic in many organisations.

Upward feedback and subsequent employee performance In the area of upward appraisal specifically, most attention in the literature focuses on the relationship between upward feedback and subsequent managerial performance. Two schools of thought exist regarding the effect of upward feedback on subsequent employee performance. Some researchers report that subordinate feedback can facilitate performance improvement, whereas others suggest that providing an employee with upward feedback does not necessarily result in performance improvement.

One of the earliest studies assessing the effect of upward appraisal on supervisor's subsequent performance was conducted by Hegarty (1974). He set out to explore whether upward feedback leads to subordinates perceiving positive changes in their supervisor's subsequent behaviour. His findings lend support to the view that the provision of subordinate feedback to supervisors can lead to an improvement in supervisors' performance in the eyes of the subordinates. Thus, Hegarty's (1974) research offered evidence that positive change could occur when supervisors received feedback from their subordinates.
