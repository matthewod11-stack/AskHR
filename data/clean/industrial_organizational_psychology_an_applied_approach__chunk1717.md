organization. Such an approach allows for high levels of feedback and can be applied to most types of employee behavior. Some behaviors, however, are not suitable for such a scale. Take, for example, the expectation that a police officer always wear her seat belt. If she wears it all the time, she has met expectations (a rating of ): There is no way to get a higher rating because one cannot wear a seat belt more often than always and thus cannot ever exceed expectations. When such a situation is possible, the scale can be adjusted to be similar to that shown in Figure ..

As shown in Figures . through ., in addition to graphic rating scales and behavioral checklists, a variety of methods to rate performance are available, including behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS), mixed-standard scales, and forced-choice scales. Because these scales are not commonly used, but are historically and psychometrically interesting, information about them has been included in the appendix to this chapter.
