# Summary

The organizational career is practical for employees when their professional development needs are addressed in concord with consideration of their nonwork circumstances. Through support for work–life balance, organizational leadership can facilitate employees’ whole-life career develop- ment by providing the benefits of the contemporary career paths within a single organization. In return, these organizations realize a competitive advantage through increased profitability, retain- ing valuable workers, and attracting talented applicants. Facilitating a whole-life approach to career development provides organizations with an opportunity to reinvent the organizational career in the new career era.
