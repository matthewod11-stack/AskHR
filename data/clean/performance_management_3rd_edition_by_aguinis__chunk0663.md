# perform).

performance refers to the activities required to be a good “organizational citizen” (e.g., helping coworkers, supporting company initiatives). In addition, voice behavior is another important facet of contextual perform- ance (i.e., raising constructive chal- lenges with the goal to improve rather than merely criticize, challenge the status quo in a positive way, and make innovative suggestions for change when others, including an employee’s supervisor, disagree). Both task and contextual performance are needed for organizational success, and both should be included in a performance management system.

- Employees do not perform in a vacuum. Employees work in a specific situation, engaging in specific behaviors that produce certain results. An emphasis on behaviors leads to a behavior-based approach to assessing performance. Anemphasis on results leads to a results- based approach to assessing perform- ance. An emphasis on the employee leads to a trait-based approach to assess- ing performance. The relative emphasis given to each of these approaches to measuring performance should be influ- enced by the organization’s business
