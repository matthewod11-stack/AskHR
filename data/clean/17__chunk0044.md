Productivity, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO) as cited in Prokopenko (1992) is the effective and efficient utilization of all resources, capital, labour, material, information and time. Nwasike (1991) also agree that productivity is the efficiency with which inputs are used to produce the desired output. Low productivity of labour, which has entrenched itself as a permanent feature and hallmarks of the economies of many countries manifests itself in a number of visible indices some of which include poor quality of domestic outputs of goods and services which stifles exportation, lack of competitiveness of products in international markets causing persistent and wide deficits in the balance of payments, simultaneous existence of surpluses and shortages of skills (occasioned by low labour mobility), use of obsolete and technology, inadequate access to basic needs and necessities of life, generally poor physical and mental health conditions of the populace, poor industrial relations and poor human resources management.
