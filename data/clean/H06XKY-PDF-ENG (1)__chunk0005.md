# What the Experts Say

Most of us feel overwhelmed, upset, and anxious when faced with

uncertainty. “We have a fundamental neuroanatomy that orients us

toward stress in highly charged times,” explains Rich Fernandez, CEO

of SIY Leadership Institute. And this can start an unhealthy cycle: “A

symptom of distraction is more distraction. Then we feel more anxious,”

says Susan David, a founder of the Institute of Coaching at McLean

Hospital and author of Emotional Agility. On a team, these feelings

can be contagious. “We subtly pick up on the emotions and start to

feel or mimic them ourselves,” she explains. Fernandez believes in

“compassionate management,” where you “seek to understand how you

can be of service and beneﬁt to employees while balancing the need to

keep them on task.” Here are practical ways to do both of those things

while oﬀering support.

Take time to process your own emotions

You’ll be better able to support your team and model resiliency if you

acknowledge and manage any stress and anxiety you feel yourself. Start

by taking the time to understand what you’re feeling. “You want to label

your emotions. Put distance between yourself and them so that you

can make a conscious decision about how to act in a way that’s in line

with your values,” David says. Even when world events feel like they are

spiraling out of control, “you still get to choose whom you want to be,”

David explains. Ask yourself: What’s most important to me? “If one of

your core values is to be collaborative, for example, ask, ‘How can I help

people feel like they’re part of the team?’”

Acknowledge what’s happening

Bottling your emotions, or expecting employees to do the same, can be

counterproductive. These feelings of concern and distress are very real

and “can’t be ignored, denied, or repressed,” says Fernandez. Pretending

that everything is ﬁne, or just trying to go about work as if nothing is

going on, can cause people to disengage or to feel resentful. Instead,
