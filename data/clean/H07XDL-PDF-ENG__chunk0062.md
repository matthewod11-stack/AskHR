# Your One-Page Life Strategy

Often, the seeming enormity of an important task — like life strategy

development — is what stops us from doing it. So, to make what seems

impossible possible, we recommend putting your entire life strategy on

a single sheet of paper. We borrowed this idea from one-page summaries

we have used in past strategy projects, and we saw it with Craig Perrett,

a leadership coach who helps very senior executives at BCG manage

their time after a successful career. If you have ﬁnished the exercises in

this article, you can easily ﬁll out this worksheet.

To start, write down what deﬁnes a great life for you. Next, record your

strengths, your values, what lights you up, and what the world needs,

and then add your purpose statement that incorporates those ideas.

Third, summarize your life vision. Fourth, refer to that 2×2 you sketched

and note the SLUs that are high priorities for action or that you spend

too much time on. Next, write down the changes you’d like to make

and commit to. Finally, for each of those changes, list an objective and

two to three key results with deadlines, and then note the anchors, the

consequences, and the check-in plan to make the change stick.
