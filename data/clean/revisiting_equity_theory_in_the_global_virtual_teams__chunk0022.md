thousand or so GVTs spend eight weeks developing solutions. Typically, the task involves designing a foreign market entry strategy, complete with market research and competition analysis, marketing strategy, research into trade regulations, HR practices, logistics and other related issues. As reported by the best literature, this is the largest and most representative data set to study GVTs and is a widely recognized “early-stage research lab” (Stahl and Maznevski, 2021).

Data was sourced from multiple sources, including participants, expert eval uations from professors who evaluated the final project report’s quality and the team members’ peer evaluations (PE). Most of the data are collected by weekly surveys, and multiple descriptions of the project, its surveys, validity and reliability of adopted scales, and reliability and management of biases are available in the literature (Taras et al., 2013; Tavoletti et al., 2022b; Tavoletti et al., 2023).

Initially, the sample consisted of 2,279 teams comprising 10,427 students who participated

in the X-Culture project in 2019. However, to ensure that missing data would not jeopardize the effectiveness of the ET model tested (by influencing our analysis or skewing students ’ PE), our research followed the recommendations from Dawson (2003) to handle the teams for which some of the data were missing. Specifically, teams with a sample ratio (SR = (N − n)/Nn, with N = group size, n = number of responses) above 0.10 were removed. The same author suggests that scores of teams with SR = 0.32 or lower are significantly correlated; hence, a cut-off of 0.10 represents an even stricter cut -off criterion. Consequently, the final sample consists of 1,343 GVTs (or 6,347 students), with team sizes ranging from 3 to 8 (average 4.7). These students were from 137 countries. The average age in our sample was 22.3, of which 50.7% were female, and 25.7% had a master’s degree and above.

Given that the GVTs are composed of students with limited working experience, it is only ion for this natural for the question to arise regarding the decision to use this particular populat research and ask whether the findings of this study would apply to a real workplace environment. To address such concerns about the ability to generalize our findings, it should be noted t hat the undergraduate and graduate participants possessed considerable work experie nce and worked on a real -life consulting project under conditions similar to a work literature review has documented a tradition of students’ samples in ET.

In addition, it is important to remember that, when studying GVTs, it is notoriously difficult to obtain a sample of teams working on the same project at the same time under the same conditions and still collect relevant data. This study did allow the possibility of examining the unique situation of having participants from 137 different countries. Moreover, convenience samples are the only option that researchers can resort to. Importantly, we conclude that the threat to the generalizability of findings based on our sample is likely minimal.

First, although the participants in our study were slightly younger than their corporate

ticipants were counterparts, many were in their thirties and even forties. About a third of the par graduate students in MBA or EMBA programs; most undergraduate students were in their last year of studies. Moreover, 71% have work experience and 57% hold a job. Most are already organizational employees, and the rest will join the labor force within a year o r so. It is unlikely that their cultural values will drastically change at that time.

Most importantly, age did not significantly correlate with our key variables, suggesting that our findings are not due to the maturation effect. Second, the project and work design very closely resembled the real workplace. The students worked on real -life business challenges presented by real-life companies. Like in real corporate project teams, the students in this s tudy relied on the communication and collaboration tools commonly found in the real workplace, such as e -mail, Skype, Google Docs, Dropbox, Doodle and Facebook chat. The team members interacted daily ld. for an extended time (two months), which is a typical project length in the corporate wor Furthermore, the international cross-cultural settings, time zone differences and the need to re ly on online communication were as real as in any GVT.

Finally, the stakes were very high, and the project was effectively temporary e mployment for the client organization. The project accounted for 30%–70% of the course grade. A failure on the project usually meant a failure in the course, resulting in negative effects on future career and earning prospects. The members of the best teams were invited to an annual symposium and most attendees received travel stipends. Although no guaranteed pay was associated w ith the work, students invested in the project, and many companies offered after -market commission and often prospects of internships and jobs for the best students.
