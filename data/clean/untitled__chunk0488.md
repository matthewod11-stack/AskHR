Comparative psychology has been a part of American psy- chology since its emergence as a separate discipline. As early as 1875, William James wrote to Harvard University presi- dent Charles W. Eliot “that a real science of man is now being built up out of the theory of evolution and the facts of ar- chaeology, the nervous system and the senses” (James, 1875/1935, p. 11). G. Stanley Hall (1901), founder of the American Psychological Association (APA), regarded the study of the evolution of the human soul as “the newest and perhaps richest ﬁeld for psychology” (pp. 731–732). Future Yale University president James Rowland Angell (1905) wrote that “if the evolutionary doctrine is correct, there seems to be no reason why we should not discover the fore- runners of our human minds in a study of the consciousness of animals” (p. 458). Although the ﬁeld has changed greatly over more than a century, some of the problems addressed during this earlier era remain relevant today (Boakes, 1984; Dewsbury, 1984).

There is no universally accepted deﬁnition of comparative psychology, although there is general agreement concerning which research is included, excluded, or falls near its bound- aries. Comparative psychology may be regarded as that part of the ﬁeld of animal psychology, the psychology of nonhu- man animals, not included within either physiological psy- chology or process-oriented learning studies.
