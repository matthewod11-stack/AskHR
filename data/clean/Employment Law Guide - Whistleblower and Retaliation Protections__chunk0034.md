Under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), employees of food manufacturers, distributors,

packers, and transporters may Ô¨Åle complaints with OSHA if they believe that they have experienced

discrimination or retaliation for reporting a violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or a regulation

promulgated under the Act. Employees are also protected from retaliation for refusing to participate in a practice that violates the Act.
