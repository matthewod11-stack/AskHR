## HBR / Magazine Article / How AI Is Redefining Managerial Roles

A research team led by Harvard Business School professor Manuel

Hoﬀmann wanted to understand how people use gen AI, and the team’s

conclusions suggest the technology is helping individual contributors

take on tasks once done by managers. From 2022 to 2024, the

researchers studied 50,032 global software developers, of whom half

used GitHub Copilot, an open-source gen AI code-writing system.

Copilot is mainly used by programmers to generate code snippets,

helping them write code faster, solve problems more quickly, and learn

on their own. Hoﬀmann and his colleagues observed more than 2.4

million actions taken on the platform, which they grouped into two

categories: core work (coding) and managerial work.

“Studying developers and how they used GitHub provided us with really

detailed information about their work,” Hoﬀmann says. “This allowed

us to follow their activity with precision and granularity to determine if

gen AI was really changing how they work, and in what way.”

They found that having access to Copilot caused people to shift task
