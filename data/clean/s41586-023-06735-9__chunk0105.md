final 2.43 million steps. Training was performed on four TPU v3 chips. We train on formation energies instead of total energies. Formation energies and forces are not normalized for training but instead we predict the energy as a sum over scaled and shifted atomic energies, such that ∑E , in which (cid:31)î is the final, scalar node fea- ture on atom i and σ and μ are the standard deviation and mean of the per-atom energy computed over a single pass of the full dataset. The network was trained on a joint loss function consisting of a weighted sum of a Huber loss on energies and forces: ̂ = ( + ) (cid:31)σ µ i ̂ ∈ atoms i N
