# There is an underlying Linear Relationship Assumption for Logistic Regression. The

assumption is : there a linear relationship between the predictor (independent) variables and

the output (dependent) variable. This means that the change in the predictor variables is

assumed to result in a linear change in the log-odds of the output variable in logistic regression.

In logistic regression, the output variable undergoes a transformation. Instead of predicting the

actual values, logistic regression predicts the probability that the given input belongs to a

particular category. The transformation involves converting the linear combination of

predictors into a probability using a logistic function, also known as the sigmoid

function.Logistic regression is particularly useful when dealing with binary outcomes or

situations where there are only two possible categories. The logistic function maps the linear

combination of predictors to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of belonging
