Hiring/ rejecting

(internal recruitment) or to hire someone from outside the organization (external recruitment). Organizations such as AT&T and Norfolk Southern Corporation first advertise employment openings for two weeks to current employees. If no qualified applicants are found, the organizations then advertise outside.

To enhance employee morale and motivation, it is often good to give current employees an advantage in obtaining new internal positions. In fact, an examination of the  rankings of the  Best Small Companies to Work for in America and the  Best Medium Companies to Work for in America indi- cates that these companies fill more than % of their open- ings with internal promotions rather than external hires (Pomeroy, ).

Internal promotions can be a great source of motivation, but if an organization always promotes employees from within, it runs the risk of having a stale workforce that is devoid of the many ideas that new employees bring with them from their previous employment settings. Heavy reliance on internal sources is thought to perpetuate the racial, gender, and age composition of the workforce. Thus, a balance between promoting current employees and hiring outside applicants is needed.

Media Advertisements Newspaper Ads Running ads in periodicals such as local newspapers or profes- sional journals is a common method of recruiting employees. Although many organizations use newspaper ads, especially for local positions, in  recruiters considered print advertis- ing as one of the least effective recruitment methods (SHRM, ). This finding demonstrates the huge change in recruit- ing that has occurred in the past decade: In , recruiters rated newspaper advertising as one of the most effective ave- nues of applicant recruitment (Gere, Scarborough, & Collison, )!

As shown in Figure ., newspaper advertisements typically ask the applicant to respond in one of four ways: calling, applying in person, sending a résumé directly to the organization, or sending a résumé to a blind box. Applicants are asked to respond by calling when an organization wants to either quickly screen applicants or hear an applicant’s phone voice (e.g., for telemarketing or receptionist positions). Organizations use apply-in-person ads when they don’t want their phones tied up by applicants calling (e.g., a travel agency or pizza delivery restaurant), want the applicants to fill out a specific job application, or want to get a physical look at the applicant. Applicants are asked to send a résumé directly to the company (send-résumé ads) when the organization expects a large response and does not have the resources to speak with thousands of applicants.
