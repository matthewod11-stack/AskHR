# Paternalistic Leadership

A style that combines strong discipline and authority with fatherly benevolence. The most common measure treats paternalistic as three dimensional, consisting of authority, benevolence, and morality (Cheng, Chou, & Farh, 2000; Cheng, Chou, Wu, Huang, & Farh, 2004). In this conceptualisation, authoritarianism is a strong form of authority which reflects the leader's unquestioned authority and control over employees, benevolence reflects the leader's care and concern for the well-being of employees (and their families), and morality reflects the leader's selflessness, moral character, and integrity.
