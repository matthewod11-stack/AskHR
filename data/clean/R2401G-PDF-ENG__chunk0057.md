with numerous residents, community leaders, civil servants, and government oﬃcials during Project Re:form. Selzer told us that at ﬁrst he made the mistake of stereotyping civil servants and oﬃcials

as uncaring and unimaginative. But when he and fellow cofounders

Michael Brennan and Lena Selzer started working with them, they

found caring and conscientious people who despised that 42-page form —and were determined to ﬁx it. Once those civil servants and oﬃcials

realized that Civilla could help and had the wherewithal to stick with

the problem, they served as supportive partners.

They helped the Civilla team navigate through hundreds of pages of

government documents in order to develop a shorter and clearer form

that still complied with regulations and laws. Civilla then worked with two oﬃces of the MDHHS to test a prototype. After that successful pilot,

Civilla helped train more than 5,000 ﬁeld staﬀers in 100 department oﬃces. The new form is 80% shorter than the old one, and the end-

to-end processing time for frontline staﬀers has dropped by 42%—

partly because they have 75% fewer errors to correct. Applications

from residents have increased by 12%, yet because fewer need help

completing them, lobby visits have dropped by 50%.

Subtraction movements. Sometimes eﬀorts to reduce friction coalesce

to become something greater than a series of activities—they become a

movement. These enduring initiatives draw on the ideas and eﬀorts of

many people in an organization. Our case study on how pharmaceutical

giant AstraZeneca scaled up simplicity is one example. It started when

senior executives oﬀered the senior director Pushkala Subramanian an

intriguing job: to head an eﬀort to simplify how the multinational’s

60,000 employees worked. Subramanian couldn’t resist the challenge,

and in 2015 she launched the Simpliﬁcation Center of Excellence. Her

team was small, only four other employees, but their ambitions were

big: The “million-hour challenge” aimed to give back 30 minutes a week
