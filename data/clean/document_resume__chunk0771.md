# Teaching Behavior

Example A (Positive): On the first day of his class, Professor Jones passed out a detailed syllabus which included his office location, hours, and telephone number; a description of the textbook and daily reading assignments, his objectives for the course; his policies on attendance, testing, calculation of grades, and dishonest behavior; and descriptions of several required class assignments. He discussed the syllabus in class and answered all questions asked about it. The syllabus served as "the rules of the class," and any questions about grading, attendance, or assignments which came up during the semester were answered with reference to the written syllabus. The students reported that they appreciated having the professor's policies set out clearly at the beginning of the semester so that they knew exactly what was expected of them. They reported that the syllabus reated a sense of fairness and allowed them to concentrate their attention on learning course content rather than trying to figure out what was expected of them by Professor Jones.

Example B (Negative) Following a lecture over a very complex theory, Professor Smith asked his students if they had any questions. One student, obviously confused, asked a question which revealed his lac:. of understanding of the theory. Professor Smith "blew up" at the student and called him "a stupid idiot" for failing to understand the theory. Professor Smith did not answer the question, nor were any other questions asked by the students. After class, several of his classmates told the student who had asked the question that they had not understood the theory either, but had been to afraid to ask a question lest they too be humbled in class. Several students failed the subsequent test because their answers indicated a lack of understanding of the theory. By handling the student's question differently, Professor Smith might have been able to better educate these students.
