In 2023, this rate was 7.2% for small group meetings, up from 4.8% in

- 2022. It should be noted that these numbers are likely underestimates, as they require the participant to never go oﬀ mute for the entire meeting (if someone brieﬂy says “hi” at the beginning but then goes

on mute for the remainder, that would not be captured).
