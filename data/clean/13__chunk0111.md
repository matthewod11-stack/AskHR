Team Leadership The role of leadership as a contextual inﬂuence on team diversity-related outcomes could be considered either in terms of speciﬁc leader attributes or leadership styles. Some researchers have considered whether leaders’ demographic attributes inﬂuenced the relationship between team demo- graphic composition and outcomes. Drawing on leader-member exchange theory and ‘‘similar-to-me’’ effects found in performance appraisal literature, Kirkman et al. (2004) argued that when leader demographic attributes do not match team demographic composition, there is likely to be lower levels trust and higher levels of bias among team members regarding their leaders. In this situation, team members may also view themselves as members of the out-group with lesser access to organizational resources. In support of these arguments, the study found that leader’s racial ﬁt with the team was associated with higher levels of team empowerment and leader rated team effectiveness (Kirkman et al., 2004).

Apart from leader attributes, leadership style can also be a moderating inﬂuence on the relationship between team diversity and outcomes. Recently, Somech (2006) considered the effects of participative versus directive leadership styles on the relationship between functional hetero- geneity and team performance and innovation. Results indicated that participative leadership styles enhanced the positive relationship between team functional heterogeneity and innovation but not team performance. The ﬁndings suggested that the style of leadership may be important to consider depending on whether innovation and creativity-based outcomes or efﬁciency and effectiveness-based outcomes of diversity are desired. Others have argued that external leaders set the stage for positive team processes, psychological safety, and clear goals and objectives for the team (Gibson & Vermeulen, 2003; Mohrman, 1995; Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006). These perspectives suggest that by paving the way for favorable group processes, leaders may be able to mitigate process losses associated with team diversity.

Theoretical developments in the area of leadership and social identity theory also suggest that motivational leadership styles are conducive to developing greater levels of collective identiﬁcation in groups. A growing body of research examines the effects of leader behaviors on identiﬁcation with collective entities (see Howell & Shamir, 2005; Shamir, House, & Arthur, 1993). Drawing on social identity theory, researchers have sugge- sted that motivational leaders, who can build enduring linkages between an individual’s self-concept and a social group, thereby can enhance identiﬁcation with the social group (Ellemers, De Gilder, & Haslam, 2004;
