## energies toward high-risk opportunities of the past rather than

capitalizing on the growth potential of tomorrow. For instance, although

Africa’s resources are so abundant that it shouldn’t need to import food

products, the practice continues because smaller local farms are

struggling to compete against enormous plantations abroad that beneﬁt

from economies of scale. To have any hope of success with sugar

farming, Assoua Group would need support from the government in the form of price controls and tariﬀs—protective measures that tend to be

politically unpopular because they increase the cost of food.

Similarly, Aminata’s proposal to expand into power production is

fraught with complexity. The proﬁtability of such projects in Africa depends on a consistent and aﬀordable fuel supply—preferably in the

form of natural gas. If the government ﬁxes the retail price of electricity,

Assoua Group won’t be able to absorb any fuel price ﬂuctuations. What’s

avoid such high-risk investments, and overseas investors are likely to

demand extensive safeguards in order to protect their capital.

There is a precedent for Aminata’s playbook: Aliko Dangote, the

petroleum reﬁning, and commodity trading. His success stemmed not
