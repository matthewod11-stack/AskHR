# performance.

In follow-up experiments with 637 workers in the United Kingdom,

we asked participants to describe both a routine task and a task

they believed they could improve, including how they would improve

it. They then rated the mental eﬀort each task required and how

much it deviated from their usual routine. These results supported

our hypothesis: proactive work breaks from established routines and

demands more mental eﬀort, compared to simply completing a routine
