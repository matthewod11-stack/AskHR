# The advantage of voluntary dispute

resolution is that accusers can decide at key points in the process whether to proceed. Once the process is initiated, if they feel the accused isn’t engaging in good faith, or that the complaint needs to be handled in a more legalistic way, they can bow out and file a formal grievance. An option to avoid. Mandatory

arbitration is all the rage today in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street. When an employer adopts mandatory arbitration, all current employees and new hires are required to sign away the right to sue for any employment-related dispute, including claims of harassment. In exchange they are promised that any

claim they file will be turned over for independent review to an external arbitrator who will hear both sides of the dispute and render a binding decision. That may sound like dispute reso- lution, but it’s far from it. Signing the arbitration contract means agreeing to keep any dispute confidential, to abide by arbitrators’ decisions, and to refrain from taking employment disputes to court. If victims feel that arbitration isn’t working, they have no recourse to a formal grievance system. And they don’t choose the arbitrator, which may put them at a disadvantage: Because arbitrators hope to be hired again by the company, they may be reluctant to find it seriously at fault. If an arbitrator had ordered a California hospital chain to pay a harassment victim $168 million, as a federal court did in 2012, would the chain still be using that arbitrator?

In 2018 the New York State Legisla- ture decided that employers shouldn’t be able to require employees to sign away their right to sue under the Civil Rights Act, and it outlawed mandatory arbitration. But in 2019 a federal judge overrode that decision. So mandatory arbitration remains legal, and the number of companies requiring it is on the rise. By a recent estimate, more than a fifth of private-sector workers are now subject to mandatory arbitration. Employees are pushing back, however. In late 2018, 20,000 Google employees walked out in protest, and in response Google agreed to end manda- tory arbitration for sexual harassment cases. Then, in early 2019, the company ended all mandatory arbitration. Perhaps that will spur other companies to follow suit. But to date mandatory arbitration

is the only option of the three listed above that has really caught on. That’s not because it serves victims well but because it does the best job of protecting companies from litigation.

Will either of the more promising alternatives catch on? As long as the courts require grievance procedures, companies won’t scrap them in favor of those alternatives. That’s fine, because victims should always have a formal grievance system available as a last resort. But everybody would surely be better off if most harassment claims were addressed through a live or virtual ombuds office or a dispute-resolution system.
