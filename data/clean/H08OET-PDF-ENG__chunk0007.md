## creates understandable interest in the age-old question: How much will

resume gaps hurt my career?

In our last article, we polled executives on LinkedIn and found that

61% of respondents viewed resume gaps negatively. We examined

data among company-switching executives and found that while those

without resume gaps captured a 22% raise, those with gaps averaged

a 14% raise. We also looked at ﬁndings from a ResumeGo survey that

indicated that gaps could lower the chances of getting a callback for a

job application, particularly if the gap was longer than two years.
