Because of the high costs of absenteeism and turnover, organizations are expending great effort to reduce the number of unscheduled absences. For these efforts to be effective, it is important that we understand why employees miss work. That is, punishment will reduce absenteeism only if employees make conscious decisions about attending. Likewise, wellness programs will increase attendance only if absenteeism is mostly the result of illness. As can be seen in Table ., in the most recent CCH survey on unscheduled absenteeism, % of absences were due to reasons other than employee illness. In a  survey of , employees by CareerBuilder.com, % of employees admitted to taking at least one “sick day” off each year even though they weren’t sick. The top three reasons for taking the time off were attending to personal errands, catching up on sleep, and relaxing.

Linking Attendance to Consequences The basis behind rewarding attendance and punishing absenteeism is that employees make a decision each day as to whether they will or will not attend work. Although the decision-making process is not clearly understood, it prob- ably includes weighing the consequences of going to work (or to class) against the consequences of not going. For example, imagine that you have an : a.m. class and are deciding whether you will attend this morning. By missing class, you can sleep a few hours longer, watch the Today Show, and stay out of the rain. By attending class, you will get the notes that you know will be on the test but aren’t in the book, get to listen to the instructor’s terrific sense of humor, and get to sit next to the great-looking student you think is interested in you. If a good test grade and a chance at a date are most important, you will attend class. If sleep is most important, you will miss class.

If in fact employees make conscious decisions about attending work, atten- dance can be increased in several ways: rewarding attendance, disciplining absen- teeism, and keeping accurate attendance records.

Rewards for Attending Attendance can be increased through the use of financial incentives, time off, and recognition programs.

Financial Incentives. Financial incentive programs use money to reward employees for achieving certain levels of attendance. One of these programs, well pay, involves paying employees for their unused sick leave. For example, Starmark International in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pays employees $ for each unused absence. Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore gives employees a $ bonus for six months of per- fect attendance and enters them into a drawing for $, after one year of perfect attendance (Armour, ). Some reward the employee by paying the equivalent of her daily salary, whereas others might split the savings by paying the employee an amount equal to half her daily salary for each unused sick day. As shown in Table ., meta-analyses found that well pay programs were the top method for reducing absenteeism.

A second method provides a financial bonus to employees who attain a cer- tain level of attendance. With this method, an employee with perfect attendance over a year might receive a $, bonus, and an employee who misses ten days might receive nothing.

A third financial incentive method is to use games to reward employees who attend work. There are many examples. One company used poker as its game, giving a playing card each day to employees who attended. At the end of the week,
