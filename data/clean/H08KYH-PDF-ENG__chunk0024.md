## judgmental attention to the present moment — in many ways, the very

antithesis of hurry sickness. Even practicing mindfulness for a few

minutes at a time — such as through deep breathing, a simple body

scan, bringing your full attention to a routine physical task such as

brewing a cup of tea, or spending a few moments listening to calming

music — can quickly lower stress and give your over-taxed mind a

needed break. Practiced over time, mindfulness can decrease your

ﬁxation on rushing to get things done and is a key ingredient in a

healthy, focused, and balanced life.
