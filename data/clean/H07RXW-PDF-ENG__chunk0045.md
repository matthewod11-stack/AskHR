What would this new approach to support services look like in practice?

Let’s say a particular microenterprise is not happy with the support

it is getting from their IT department. Because all departments are

microenterprises, there are multiple IT microenterprises to choose

from. They compete with autonomy for internal clients. The initial

microenterprise can even decide to contract with an external, third-

party IT service provider, if they so choose. And if a supporting ME is

not competitive enough to win internal clients, its budget is eﬀectively

reduced or cut not because a centralized authority decided to cut it, but

because they couldn’t succeed internally.
