# Address pushback with curiosity.

If your peer says they don’t have bandwidth, dig deeper: “Tell me more

about what your team is juggling right now.” Maybe you can extend the

timeline, break the work into smaller pieces, or take on more of the

up-front lift before handing it oﬀ.

If your colleague seems hesitant about the commitment, ask directly,

“What concerns do you have about taking this on?” Their reluctance

might stem from a past experience, a lack of clarity, or competing

priorities—things you can problem-solve together if surfaced.

And if the objection is, “This doesn’t feel like it should be our job,” stay

open. For example, say, “Help me understand what parts don’t feel like

a natural ﬁt?” If you still believe they’re the best owner, don’t shy away

from saying so. Try something like: “I hear your concerns. The thing is,

your team is already the go-to for this type of reporting. Bringing us in

would create confusion.”
