Although current research investigating gender or ethnic diﬀerences in

political skill is limited, researchers Pamela Perrewé and Debra Nelson

argue that women often overlook the importance of oﬃce politics and

rely on task accomplishment as the primary means of advancing their

careers. Many women are reluctant to engage with it, or even see it

“politically naïve” for avoiding politics, and argued that training and

mentoring initiatives are necessary to help women see the value in

oﬃce politics and learn to play the game.

This argument, however, is built on the assumption that women and

minorities lack the political skills needed to navigate organizational

life. Recent research does not support this idea. A 2013 study published

in the Journal of Leadership Studies ﬁnds that men and women see

themselves as equal in relation to their political abilities. A 2015 study

published in the Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal discovered that

female students perceive themselves to be more politically skilled than

male students. If the issue isn’t a lack of skill, then why are women and

racial minorities less engaged in oﬃce politics? Unpacking this issue
