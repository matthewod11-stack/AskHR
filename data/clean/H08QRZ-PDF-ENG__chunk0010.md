intimate bodily data, they can feel that their long-term prospects

forthcoming research we conducted a study on U.S. health insurers’

practice of providing discounts to employers when employees agree to

comprehensive physical screenings. On the surface, this seems like a

win-win-win for the insurer, employer, and employees. The insights on

employee health help the insurer better manage their risk exposure,

the employer saves money and potentially sees more productivity, and
