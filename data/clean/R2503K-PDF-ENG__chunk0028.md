don’t want to be the one to say it. The second question acknowledges that

issues have likely been overlooked and should be brought forward.

When I ﬁrst started teaching, I frequently stopped throughout my

lectures to ask, “Do you have any questions?” Inevitably, the same few

students responded, while the majority stayed silent. But when I graded

their assignments, it became clear that many didn’t fully understand

the material. Eventually, I stopped asking if they had questions and

started asking what questions they had and began to say things like,

“This is a challenging concept. I’m sure you have questions, so now

is a great time to ask them.” This tactic is particularly eﬀective when

dealing with people from collectivist cultures or a mix of cultural

backgrounds because it normalizes the act of asking questions and

fosters a more inclusive environment. So, instead of asking, “Are you

facing any challenges?” try something like, “We just ﬁnished a tough

quarter. Everyone is facing signiﬁcant challenges. I want to hear about

yours.” This shift signals that sharing challenges is not only safe but

expected.

Psychological safety is critical, but it must be developed with cultural

intelligence to ensure that diversity moves beyond being a politically

correct bonus to becoming a genuine source of improved performance
