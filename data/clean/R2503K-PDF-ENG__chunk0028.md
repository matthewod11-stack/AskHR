launching a campaign. Some team members preferred gathering input

early in the process while others felt more comfortable securing buy-in

after the design was nearly ﬁnal. The team agreed that both were viable

ways to follow the six-week rule of thumb.

Many global teams have become places where safety, inclusion, and belonging are emphasized at the expense of intellectual honesty.
