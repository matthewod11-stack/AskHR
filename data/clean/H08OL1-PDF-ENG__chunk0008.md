## HBR / Digital Article / Research: The Gender Wage Gap Tipping Point

wage gap is deﬁned as female full-time workers’ median earnings

divided by male full-time workers’ median earnings.

Our results showed that the gender wage gap closed more quickly when

there were fewer than 14% women in the category—in other words,

when women were more underrepresented. But once women made up

a certain proportion of the occupation—the “tipping point”—progress

continued but at a much slower pace. For example, before the tipping

point, adding just 1 percentage point more women to a job category, say

from 8% to 9%, shrinks the wage gap noticeably. But after that point,

progress slows such that it takes adding about 3.6 percentage points

more women, say from 20% to 23.6%, to achieve the same improvement.
