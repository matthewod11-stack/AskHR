# The Appeal of Fake News

What’s happening here? Many executives don’t understand the viral

nature of the problem and can often inadvertently amplify fake news by discussing it. This phenomenon is known as the “Streisand eﬀect,”

named after the actor-singer Barbra Streisand, whose unsuccessful

attempts to prevent knowledge about her home address from spreading

inadvertently made it more widely known. Once a piece of fake news reaches a certain threshold, eﬀorts to suppress it will be largely in

vain. For example, in 2016, PepsiCo faced a viral fake-news crisis when

stories circulating on social media falsely claimed that CEO Indra

Nooyi had told Trump supporters to “take their business elsewhere.”
