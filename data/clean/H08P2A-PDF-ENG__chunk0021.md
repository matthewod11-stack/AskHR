# Ask: “Who?”

Third, ask who is attending the meeting. Does everyone in the meeting

have similar levels of seniority, power, and experience? How well do

people know each other—are they good friends, work acquaintances,

riskier for those with low power, so consider whether you want to

introduce something that might make those individuals feel less safe.

Similarly, interactions with people we don’t know are inherently riskier
