Enders et al (2020) stated that resistance to change is, despite its negative connotation, a natural propensity of human disposition. This innate resistance behaviour is the individual’s intrinsic desire to maintain a psychological balance offering a sense of security and control. Thus, this intended balance may be disturbed by behavioural change, which is why individuals usually avoid initiating or actively embracing change. However, the reasons for resistance are either active or passive: active resistance is defined by conscious rejection motivated by contradictory beliefs or traditions or by functional issues. In contrast, passive resistance occurs even before the actual assessment of an innovation and is caused by a general aversion to behavioural or attitudinal changes (Guidetti et al, 2018).

Concerning the techniques used to counteract resistance to change, Robbins et al (2018, p.218) have mentioned: “education and communication, participation, facilitation and support, negotiation, manipulation and cooption, and coercion respectively”. These techniques are summarized in table no. 1. Managers should use such techniques as instruments, selecting the most appropriate amongst them based on the type and source of resistance.

Education and communication can “help reduce resistance to change by helping employees see the logic of the change efforts”. This technique assumes that resistance is mostly determined by misinformation or poor communication (Robbins et al, 2018, p.218).

Participation means “involving the people directly impacted by the proposed change in the decision-making process”. Participation allows these individuals to express their feelings, thus enhancing the quality of the process and increasing the employees’ commitment to the final decision (Robbins et al, 2018, p.218).

Facilitation and support imply “helping the employees cope with the change-related anxiety”. This help may include counselling, therapy, development of new skills or short-term paid leave of absence. Negotiation involves “exchanging something of value for an agreement to reduce resistance to change efforts”. This technique may prove quite useful when the resistance comes from a strong source. Manipulation and cooption refer to “the attempts to influence other people with respect to change”. Coercion can be used to cope with resistance. Coercion involves “making use of the managers’ authority to punish the subordinated staff’s behaviour” (Robbins et al, 2018, p.218).
