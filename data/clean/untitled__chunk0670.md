# The Philosophical Period 111

racy are just acts, Socrates wanted to know what Justice itself is. Plato extended Socrates’ quest for universal moral truths to encompass all universal concepts. Thus, we apply the term “cat” to all cats, no two of which are identical; how and why do we do this? Answering this question became a central pre- occupation of thephilosophyandpsychology of cognition.

The second important feature of Socrates’philosophy was the demand that for a belief to count as real knowledge, it had to be justiﬁable. Asoldier might do many acts of heroic brav- ery but be unable to explain what bravery is; a judge might be esteemed wise and fair but be unable to explain what justice is; an art collector might have impeccable taste but be unable to say what beauty is. Socrates regarded such cases as lying awkwardly between opinion and Truth. The soldier, judge, and connoisseur intuitively embrace bravery, justice, and beauty, but they do not possess knowledge of bravery, justice, and beauty unless and until they can articulate and defend it. For Socrates, unconscious intuition, even if faultless in appli- cation, was not real knowledge.
