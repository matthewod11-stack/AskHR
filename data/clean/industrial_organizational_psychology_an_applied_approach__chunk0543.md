analysis. Th e best method to use in analyzing a job appears to be related to the end use of the job analysis information. Th at is, diﬀ erent methods are best for diﬀ erent uses—worker-oriented methods, such as the CIT, JCI, and TTA, are the best for employee selection and performance appraisal; job-oriented methods, such as task analysis, are best for work design and writing job descriptions. To get the most out of a job analysis, several techniques should be used so that informa- tion on each of the job description sections can be obtained.

From a legal perspective, courts have ruled that job analysis is necessary (Sparks, ) and that acceptable job analyses should () use several up-to-date sources, () be conducted by experts, () use a large number of job incumbents, and () cover the entire range of worker activities and qualiﬁ cations (Th ompson & Th ompson, ).

Other than a meta-analysis demonstrating that job analysis ratings of spe- ciﬁ c tasks are more reliable than ratings of general work activities (Dierdorﬀ & Wilson, ), little research directly comparing job analysis methods has been conducted. Th is lack of research is primarily because direct comparison of meth- ods is virtually impossible: Each method yields results that diﬀ er in both the number and type of dimensions. Th us, the comparative research that has been conducted has focused on opinions of job analysts.

Survey research by Levine, Ash, and their colleagues (Levine, Ash, & Bennett,
