# Purposes of this Article

In view of the above and the relative paucity of research on the antecedents and consequences of stigmatization in organizations (SIO), the primary purposes of this article are to (a) present a model of SIO that considers cognitive, affective, and cultural inï¬‚uences on stigmatization and HRM processes and practices, (b) describe the types of unfair discrimination faced by stigmatized individuals in organizations, (c) discuss the implications of this model for overcoming the unfair treatment of stigmatized persons in organizations, and (d) suggest directions for future research on SIO.
