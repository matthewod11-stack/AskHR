The World Competitiveness Report (1994) provides aranking of countries that combines the quality of public education, levels of secondary schooling and on-the-job training, computer literacy, and worker motivation. The United States ranks sixth, behind (in descending order) Singapore, Denmark, Germany, Japan, and Norway. Al- though none of the higher-ranking countries is as heter- ogeneous as the United States, the lesson for decision makers is clear: The race to create a broad, technically literate labor pool has no finish line!
