## all your current responsibilities and time commitments for the week

(or even a couple months) ahead. Then, reﬂect on which upcoming

opportunities realistically ﬁt in your schedule and are related to your

scope of work. Remember, your calendar doesn’t have to be jam-packed

for you to know you’re at full capacity. It should have some white spaces

for things that may come up at the last minute or for doing some deep

work when you need it. This will help you have an accurate idea of what

you are already committed to and how much time you really have.
