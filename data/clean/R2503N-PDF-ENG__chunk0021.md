## employee survey results or after all-staﬀ meetings.

- 4. Exhaustion

Exhaustion is a silent killer of eﬀective listening. When leaders are

physically or emotionally drained, they lose their capacity to focus,

process, and engage productively with employees. Imagine a boss who

has just ﬁnished back-to-back meetings and skipped lunch and is now

on a late-afternoon call with a team member sharing a pressing concern.

Despite being present physically, her attention drifts, and she’s unable

to respond thoughtfully.
