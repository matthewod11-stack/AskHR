## HBR / Magazine Article / Are You Really a Good Listener?

That’s probably how Google leaders felt as one TGIF meeting after another surfaced a slew of diﬃcult employee concerns. At a small

startup, a weekly meeting that allows all employees to talk to top management is realistic. At a company of 100,000, it’s more diﬃcult.

The best way to avoid exhausted listening is to establish clear

boundaries. That might involve blocking out certain hours when your

door or calendar is open and others when it’s not, setting time limits on

manager can ask colleagues and team members to check in with their

employees and peers to share the listening load. If your organization

has regular meetings like TGIFs where people voice suggestions and

concerns, the person running them should rotate. That will help prevent
