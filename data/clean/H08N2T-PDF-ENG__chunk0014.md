# HBR / Digital Article / 6 Questions to Help You Decide What You Want in Your Next Job

Chances are that, like most people, you may feel inclined to answer no

to all of these questions (they are deliberately chosen for their extreme

negative connotation). However, it is also likely that you could rank-

order them to be left with the absolute no’s at the top and a couple of “near-maybes” at the bottom; this is a simple and eﬃcient way to

organize your priorities.

- 2. What are my ﬁnancial considerations?

How much does ﬁnancial compensation matter to me, and would this

new role meet my (current and future) ﬁnancial goals? How much do I

need to earn? How much would I need to earn to put up with things I

don’t like? How much pay would I be happy to sacriﬁce for a job that

oﬀers better learning opportunities, a nicer culture, and more inspiring

or motivating challenges? Most people make job and career choices

based on money, but money is a weak predictor of job satisfaction. As it

turns out, there is a big diﬀerence between what people want and what

they actually need in order to be happy with their jobs. At the same

time, not everybody cares about being happy at work, since there are

many sources of meaning in life other than work. In any event, being

honest with yourself about how much pay and compensation matters,

and how much you are willing to compromise or sacriﬁce to go beyond

the minimum level of income you need, should inform your choices.

- 3. What drives me at work?

Am I motivated by power, status, or leadership opportunities? Do I need

to have fun at work? How important is it to have great colleagues?

Does the job or career need to cater to my hungry mind? Does this

role provide a path to those ambitions? There are many models of work-

related values, but they are mostly interchangeable. They also align in

one fundamental assumption: When people pick jobs or careers that

are congruent with their values, they will generally be happier, stay in

the job longer, and perform better. So, if these questions are hard to

answer, look around for potential role models or people you admire,
