## HBR / Digital Article / The High Costs of Chief Revenue Officer Turnover

43% of companies experienced at least one year of negative growth

in the past three years, and fewer than 3% managed to consistently

increase their growth rate each of the last three years. Firing the CRO

is one of the most common actions a board of directors takes when

growth is challenged. Our research shows that CRO turnover accelerated

by more than 50% from 2022 to 2023 (with 70% of CROs who left their

post being asked to leave). This trend doesn’t show any signs of abating:

Our survey of CEOs found only 41% of them express conﬁdence that

their CRO can drive commercial success for their organization.

Naturally, it stands to reason that when growth isn’t happening,

someone needs to be held accountable. But here’s our take: replacing

the CRO is often a recipe for further suppressing and likely decelerating

growth. It is something most executive teams would be wise to carefully

and conservatively consider before acting.
