# Voluntary dispute resolution. For

an alternative that falls somewhere between a formal grievance procedure and an ombuds office, consider a dispute-resolution system that relies on mediation. In this model, mediators hear claims, notify the accused, and try to find solutions that satisfy both sides. Some employers use professional mediators; others train their own workers to do the job. The system is less adversarial than a legalistic grievance procedure. This often suits victims, many of whom simply want their harassers to cut it out. But the victim must feel comfortable being iden- tified to the accused, and both parties must be committed to finding a solu- tion. Obviously, this approach doesnâ€™t work for the most egregious cases of harassment, for which the only sensible solution is to fire the perpetrator.

The U.S. Postal Service has long done interesting work with dispute resolution for discrimination and harassment complaints. For a while it experimented with outside professional mediators, and later it trained employees to do the job. Both options have worked well.
