## THE PRESENT: CURRENT THEORY RELEVANT TO DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE

Over the history of research on dynamic performance, repeated calls have been made for more theoretical development (e.g., Austin et al., 1989; Campbell, 1990; Deadrick & Madigan, 1990; Deadrick et al., 1997; Henry & Hulin, 1987; Hofmann et al., 1992, 1993; Hulin et al., 1990; Steele-Johnson et al., 2000). While more theoretical progress is certainly desired, there are some notable works that have considered the issue of what happens to performance over time that provide a useful framework for research in this area. Some of this research has been widely cited in the dynamic performance literature. Others are relevant but have not been extensively applied or developed within the literature. The purpose of this section is to review theoretical perspectives that are applicable for studying performance over time, hopefully presenting opportunities for greater clariÔ¨Åcation and demonstrating where future research is most needed.
