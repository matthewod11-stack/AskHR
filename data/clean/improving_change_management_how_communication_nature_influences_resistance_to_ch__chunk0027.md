“much of organizational change work around achieving consensus

through participation in dialogue, remains quite monologic (one logic);

even when a diversity of points of view interact in dialogue, the stress is

placed upon achieving consensus, or in utilizing rhetorics of persuasion to

arrive at common ground for all (to keep contentious point of view on the

margin)…A supposedly polyphonic dialogue can remain monologic (one

logic) and not achieve polylogical (multiple logic) aims” (Jabri, Adrian et

al., 2008: 678-679).

As a consequence, it is possible to deduce that, on several occasions during

participation activities designed to produce dialogic communication, this is not achieved

and participants, although supposedly participating, are in fact engaged in a monologic

communication through which they are at most allowed to voice their opinions without

any real possibility of influencing the change process. Summing up, different

participation processes may occur within a change implementation: what could be

called dialogic participation (participants considered as authentic subjects) or monologic

participation (where participants are treated as objects).

In order to operationalize the differences between these two proposed natures of

participation, it is worth building up from the concept of dialogue, and one of the most

incisive is offered by Heath et al:
