## HBR / Magazine Article / The Uniqueness Trap

estimate of how much that eﬀort, which would take decades, would

cost, as well as how expensive it would be to safely store nuclear waste,

which would last centuries. The Swedish government was going to ask

the nuclear industry to pay into a fund to cover the costs, and it needed

to know how much to collect.

The Swedish oﬃcial approached one of us, Bent Flyvbjerg, for advice.

Bent didn’t think he could help. At the time he didn’t have any data

on nuclear decommissioning. No other country had carried out such a

program. (Decommissioning nuclear plants has become more common since then.) The project truly did seem unique. But the Swedish oﬃcial

had read an article Bent had written about the costs and cost risks for

transportation infrastructure projects involving roads, bridges, tunnels,

and rail lines. He proposed using Bent’s data as a “ﬂoor” and assuming

that the real cost risks of nuclear decommissioning would be higher.

The Swedish government could get the nuclear industry to start making

payments based on the ﬂoor and then adjust the estimate and the

payments as it learned more about decommissioning. Bent realized that

he had fallen into the uniqueness trap by assuming that the manager

of a project as unprecedented as nuclear decommissioning would have

nothing to learn from other projects. He has never forgotten that lesson.
