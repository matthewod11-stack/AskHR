# perspectives.

Ask your manager if there are opportunities to mentor junior

employees, or oﬀer to lead a training session. If your company has an

internship program, are there ways for you to lend support? Sharing

your knowledge with others can remind you just how much you’ve

learned and accomplished already in your career. It can be easy to take

that for granted. In addition, teaching a skill can help break up the

monotony you’re feeling because it provides an opportunity for you to

articulate and apply your skills. Witnessing the transformation in others

can feel incredibly rewarding.

Mentoring doesn’t have to be a long-term commitment. Even a single

conversation can have an impact on someone’s career and remind you

of what you’ve achieved.
