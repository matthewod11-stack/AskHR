specific business or of an information system in particular. With the intention to contribute to management of talents, the finding of this study suggest the presence of two extremes: on one hand, 15 percent of the total of researched responders have a strong wish to leave the organization, while on the other hand, 38 percent have will to leave, and 47 percent of the sample are the neutral.

The results of the present research suggest that six variables are correlated negatively with turnover intention, but with different intensities. They are “organizational commitment,” “affective and normative dimensions,” “job satisfaction,” “the dimension satisfaction with the salary,” “dimension satisfaction with the promotions” and “dimension satisfaction with the natureof thejob,” whereas among demographic variables, only the age is negatively correlated with the intention to leave.

Two dimensions of the organizational commitment were the ones that presented a bigger negative correlation with the turnover intention in the entire study, which is even bigger than the ones of job satisfaction. The affective commitment was the most significant (−0.462**) followed by the normative commitment (−0.325**).

The multiple regression realized among the three dimensions of organizational commitment and turnover intention even elaborates these findings more. It evidences that, for this group of responders, the affective and normative dimensions together explain 25.2 percent of the variability of the rotative intention. It means that it can be considered that these two are the most impacting dimensions in the intention to leave.

The affective commitment is significant in 85 percent of responders in the studied enterprise; the instrumental, however, is present in only 20 percent of responders, which, according these authors, indicates a small turnover intention; thus, it is not characterized as a problem.

The normative bonds, although demonstrate to be present in only 25 percent of participants, however, are negatively correlated with the intention to leave; that is why deserve special attention ofinstitution managers. Thefindingssuggest that employees did not demonstrate to have the intention of staying in the enterprise due to a moral obligation sense to it. They seem to be not incorporating the values and organizational rules to the point where they have certain behavior only because they believe that it is a right thing to do. One of the possible interpretations is to infer that the employees are able to “leave the enterprise in hand” if they notice that they will have personal advantages in other organization.

The qualitative part of this research confirms the presence of three approaches of commitment between Group A (no intention to leave), however same is not the case with Group B (with intention to leave). This is another clue of the existence of the correlation between this variable and the intention to leave the organization.

As said earlier, three dimensions of job satisfaction evidenced a negative correlation with turnover intention. Two of them evidenced a negative correlation with the turnover intention in an intense way: job satisfaction (−0.324**) and promotion (−0.312**) that are strongly correlated with each other (0.625**), since both are about remuneration. The third dimension of job satisfaction which negatively influences the intention to leave is the satisfaction with the nature of the job (−0.242**).

The multiple regression realized among the five dimensions of job satisfaction and turnover intention still elaborates the findings more, evidencing that for this group of responders, the dimensions satisfaction with the nature of the job and with salary together explain 15.3 percent variability of the turnover intention. It means that it can be considered that these two dimensions are the ones that have more impact on the intention to leave.

The multiple regression realized with all remaining variables together (satisfaction with the salary, with the nature of the job, age, affective and normative commitment) revealed that only three variables explain 30.2 percent variability of turnover intention. They are affective commitment, satisfaction with the salary, and normative commitment, representing the order of intensity, respectively.
