Contrasting findings emerged between objective measures versussubjectivemeasuresofacoupleorganizationalvariables. While report of being under scheduled was correlated with intention to turnover in behavior technicians, the number of hours worked per week was not found to be correlated with intention to turnover (Kazemi et al. 2015). Likewise, level of satisfactionwithpaywasnegativelycorrelatedwith intention to turnover; however, wages earned per hour were not found to be correlated with intention to turnover (Kazemi et al. 2015).

Other factors were identified as being related to burnout and intention to turnover in behavior technicians. Level of satisfac- tion with training was negatively correlated with intention to turnover (Kazemi et al. 2015). High levels of perceived work demandswerecorrelated withgreaterlevelsofburnout (Gibson etal.2009).Finally,greaterlevelsofjobsatisfactionwerefound to be associated with less intention to turnover (Kazemi et al. 2015) and lower levels of burnout (Hurt et al. 2013).

Several factors were investigated and not found to be sig- nificant predictors. Receipt of benefits and number of hours spent traveling were not found to be correlated with intention to turnover (Kazemi et al. 2015). Furthermore, setting of treat- ment services (e.g., home, school) was not found to be a pre- dictor of intention to turnover (Kazemi et al. 2015).
