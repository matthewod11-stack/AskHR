# beneﬁcial agreement.

There is a second problem with Logan’s $6 billion bid: It is an

aggressively low number, one that he did not bother to explain or

justify to Nan. Negotiators who provide explanations for their proposals

are more likely to reach agreements than those who do not oﬀer any

justiﬁcation, research shows. Compelling, well-reasoned explanations

show the other side that you’ve given considerable thought to your oﬀer

and that it is well justiﬁed.

Frame your proposal.

When Kendall, Roman, and Shiv meet with Nan Pierce in person to tell

her they are interested in making an oﬀer, she is quick to tell them that

she has a solid oﬀer already and that they made the trip in vain. Nan
