## Have the Employee’s Values and Expectations Been Met?

Our work motivation and job satisfaction are determined by the discrepancy between what we want, value, and expect and what the job actually provides. For example, if you enjoy working with people but your job involves working with data, you are not likely to be motivated by or satisfied with your job. Likewise, if you value helping others, yet your job involves selling things people don’t really need, you will probably not be motivated to perform well.

Potential discrepancies between what employees want and what the job gives them affect how motivated and satisfied employees will be with their jobs (Knoop, ; Rice, Gentile, & McFarlin, ). For example, imagine that Jane most values money and Akeem most values flexibility. Both are in jobs that pay well but have set hours and a standard routine. Though the job and the company are the same, one employee (Jane) will be motivated and the other (Akeem) will not be.
