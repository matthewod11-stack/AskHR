# Dear Personnel Director:

Mr. John Anderson asked that I write this letter in support of his application as an assistant manager, and I am pleased to do so. I have known John for six years as he was my assistant in the accounting department.

John was one of the most popular employees in our agency as he is a friendly, outgoing, sociable individual. He has a great sense of humor, is poised, and is very helpful. In completing his work, he is independent, energetic, and industrious.

John always had his work completed accurately and promptly. In his six years here, he never missed a deadline. He is very detail oriented, diligent in finding errors, and methodical in his problem- solving approach. Interpersonally, John is a very friendly and helpful person.

I have great confidence in Johnâ€™s ability. If you desire more information, please let me know.
