# Reframe resistance.

When people are upset with you, your brain assumes you must have

done something wrong. You take it personally, when in fact, most of the

time, people’s reactions have less to do with you and more to do with

their own fears. According to change management researcher William

Bridges, any transition begins with an “endings” phase, where people

grieve what they’re losing before they embrace what they’re gaining. In

other words, the backlash you’re experiencing is a natural byproduct of

processing the end of something familiar.
