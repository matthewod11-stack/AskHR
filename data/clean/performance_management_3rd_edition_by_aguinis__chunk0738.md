# 5.2.1 Comparative Systems

Comparative systems of measuring behaviors imply that employees are compared to one other. If a simple rank order system is used, employees are simply ranked from best performer to worst performer. Alternatively, in an alternation rank order proce- dure, the supervisor initially lists all employees. Then, the supervisor selects the best performer (#1), then the worst performer (#n), then the second best (#2), then the second worst (#n(cid:3)1), and so forth, alternating from the top to the bottom of the list until all employees have been ranked.

Paired comparisons is another comparative system. In contrast to the simple and alternation rank order procedures, explicit comparisons are made between all pairs of employees to be evaluated.14 In other words, supervisors systematically compare the per- formance of each employee against the performance of all other employees. The number of pairs of employees to be compared is computed by the following equation:

n(n - 1) 2

where n is the number of employees to be evaluated. If a supervisor needs to evaluate the performance of 8 employees, she would have to make [8(8 (cid:3)1)]/2 (cid:4) 28 comparisons. The supervisor’s job is to choose the better of each pair, and each individual’s rank is determined by counting the number of times he or she was rated as better.

Another type of comparison method is the relative percentile method.15 This type of measurement system asks raters to consider all ratees at the same time and to estimate the relative performance of each by using a 100-point scale. The 50-point mark on this scale (i.e., 50th percentile) suggests the location of an average employee—about 50% of employees are better performers and about 50% of employees are worse performers than this individual. Relative percentile methods may include one such scale for each compe- tency and also include one scale on which raters evaluate the overall performance of all employees. Figure 5.2 includes an example of a relative percentile method scale to measure the competency “communication.” In this illustration, the rater has placed employee DS at roughly the 95th percentile, meaning that DS’s performance regarding communication is
