# (Un)belonging at work

Exchanges between planning and production would be good for the planning colleagues. Then they would notice that switching to the production of another product in the factory requires more than just pushing a button for us operators. It takes 10 to 11 hours to start a new product because the machines should be cleaned before we can actually switch. (field notes)

In turn, the planning department accused the pro-

duction department of being ignorant:

Production does not know how much time it takes us to hunt down mistakes they make [like tagging and registering a product correctly in the system] and then correct them. If we call them to clear something up, you hear them think: ‘there they go again, those naggers.’ Yet planning is always in the middle. We have to take into account what is going on in pro- duction and then synchronize with internal logistics, customer service, and truck drivers, while the labo- ratory also has to do the analyses of products before these can be shipped. It would be good to show oper- ators that it is simply impossible for us to plan longer runs of one product in the factory. (field notes)

Similar frustrations and accusations were expressed by the mechanics at the maintenance department who felt their expertise and knowledge of the factories were not consulted by the engineering department:

I recognize that it demotivates me and makes me impassive that my knowledge is not used by engi- neering, despite the fact that we work here every day. (field notes)

This example explicitly underlines the connection between being valued or needed (in making decisions, improvements and innovations in work processes) and organizational belonging. Moreover, the examples shows how a lack of organizational belonging might impair one’s perceived health at work, as the mechanic feels demotivated and impassive. After an incident with hot water bursting out of a pipeline, the Health, Safety and Environment officer reduced the water tempera- ture in a factory. An operator commented:

I have the impression that everything gets decided from behind the desk, like reducing the water temper- ature. We know that you cannot clean the chemicals of that specific factory with cold water. A structural solution is missing. It’s panic stations. (field notes)

Increased visits from the offices to the factory would enhance the understanding of the nature of factory

work: if the Health, Safety and Environment officer had consulted the operators, she would have known that hot water was required in this particular part of the factory.

The large organizational distance that catalyses the lack of organizational belonging can be partially explained by the actual spatial distances between departments in the industrial production company. The production departments and the office departments were located in separate buildings, taking a few min- utes to reach by foot. The spatial division between the factory and the office was materialized through the use of personal protection equipment, which was perceived as irregular for office employees:

Having changed into our suits and protection mate- rials, we leave the dressing room and walk towards the factory while enjoying the sun on our faces after some harsh winter days. The maintenance supervi- sor steps out of the workshop and says, ‘It’s tech- nical weather, right?’ We are puzzled. He explains, ‘During the first nice days after wintertime, the peo- ple from the offices suddenly visit the factory to get out and get some sun. Just like parakeets, they wear yellow safety jackets. And they suddenly want to see all kinds of things, like tourists.’ (field notes)

The vignette shows how factory employees perceive the visits by office employees on sunny days—it’s only in nice weather that office employees are bothered to visit the factory. It reflects the general impression of office employees and factory employees that each group is distant from the work of the other and that they do not recognize each other’s work, conditions and expertise.

These empirical examples suggest that the aspects of organizational belonging, being valued and feel- ing to fit in, were not met on the company-wide level of the industrial production company. Moreover, the lack of organizational belonging seem to be fuelled by and expressed through spatio-material dimen- sions of belonging. In line with Baumeister and Leary (Baumeister and Leary, 1995), we have shown how the unfulfillment of the human desire to be an integral part of an organization led to feelings of frustration, stress, demotivation and impassiveness among employees of the industrial production company, which negatively impacted perceived workplace health.

(Un)belonging to the social workplace In the social workplace, similar to the other company, being valued, feelings to fit and large organizational distance were also mentioned to impact organiza- tional belonging and workplace health. An employee shared that he only experienced appreciation from
