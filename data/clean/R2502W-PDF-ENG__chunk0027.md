## AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Replit, and

Cursor enable developers to outsource manual, lower-value tasks,

including generating basic code, populating reference articles, and

suggesting unit tests to run. Developers can then focus on higher-value

tasks that require judgment and creativity, such as writing nuanced

code, troubleshooting, and performing security analysis, all of which lead to greater eﬃciencies and a better ﬁnished product. Many studies

have shown that developers using various AI coding tools are able to

complete tasks 20% to 55% faster. Most developers also reported that

they were able to focus on more-important work and felt more fulﬁlled
