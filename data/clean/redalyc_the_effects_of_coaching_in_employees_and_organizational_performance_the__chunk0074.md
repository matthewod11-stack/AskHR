# organisational performance, and sales and productivity growthâ€”to assure the validity of each

construct of our model. We performed evaluations using Satorra-Bentler scaled c2 = 171.3840,

with 151 degrees of freedom and p=0.12263. The other adjustment indices have the following

values: NNFI=0.973, CFI=0.976, IFI=0.976 and MFI=0.934. Finally, the RMSEA error is

<0.03. Moreover, all of the relationships are significant (p=0.05). Therefore, the evaluation of

the indices shows a good fit based on the accepted criteria (Kline, 2005).

- 4. Results of causal model estimation

With the information from the previous analyses, we proceeded to estimate the proposed

model linking organisational support and coaching with individual employee performance as

well as linking individual performance with organisational performance measures and sales

increases with productivity growth. Having specified, identified and estimated the model, we
