## What to Do If You Are Unhappy with Your Job

In this chapter you learned the reasons why employ-

ees are dissatisfied with their jobs and interven- tions that organizations can engage in to increase employee satisfaction. Unfortunately, many organiza- tions will not be proactive in their approach to job satisfaction. That means that you must take responsi- bility for your own level of happiness and satisfaction. What can you do? S

During the initial employment interview, ask questions about the job and the organization. Ask to meet other employees and perhaps watch how the job is done. Remember that two causes of job dissatisfaction are expectations not being met and a poor person/job fit. The more you know prior to accepting the job offer, the greater opportunity you will have to communicate your expectations to the organization, find out what they expect from you, and assess how well the job and organization fit with your needs, values, and personality.
