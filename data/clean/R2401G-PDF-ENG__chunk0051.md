## or three targets and outline rough implementation plans—who might

lead the charge, whose support they would need, and which people or

teams might quash the change. Some groups pick a practical idea (one

CEO vowed to keep his emails under 500 words) and an impractical one

(engineers proposed to disband HR). Others select something easy to

subtract (one team reduced the number of communications apps it was

using) and something tough (the members of a top team agreed that

their company would run better and their mental health would improve

if they removed two micromanagers from the board of directors).

One companywide effort saved thousands of hours: changing the default meeting length on Outlook software from 30 minutes to 15 minutes.

Groups sometimes act on the spot. While playing the game with 25

colleagues at a software ﬁrm, one vice president disbanded a troubled

project and shifted his weekly team meeting to every other week.

The CEO of a ﬁnancial services company jumped up and told his

top 80 people that within a week he wanted an email from each of

them with two subtraction targets. Within a month he wanted the

changes implemented—and he oﬀered each person a $5,000 bonus for

making that happen. Nearly all 80 managers earned the bonus. Their

changes included ending poorly performing product lines, eliminating

meetings, and terminating contracts with unreliable vendors.
