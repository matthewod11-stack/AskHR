# The Departure

Leaders alter their habitual—and successful—ways of doing things only

when they become aware of a gap between where they are and where

they want to be. The catalyst might be a particular event or feedback

from colleagues or coaches. But usually people embark on a concerted

eﬀort to change only after multiple experiences and conversations make

them realize that their behavior is impeding outcomes they care about.

Take Flavio, who worked as the general manager of engineering at a

major technology ﬁrm before becoming its COO and then its CEO. In his

role as general manager, Flavio was eager to enhance the ways that his

sales teams positioned products and to increase sales. In his view they

weren’t getting products to market fast enough, so he drove them harder

and harder. Soon he began to hear that people felt he was pushing his

own agenda instead of the company’s—but he dismissed that as the

grumbling of those resistant to change. Then colleagues he respected

began to withdraw from conversations with him—including people

whose support was critical. His behavior, one former team member told

him candidly, was alienating the very people he needed to make his

go-to-market strategy work. An executive coach helped him understand

the core of the problem—he wasn’t crafting strategy jointly with others

—and acknowledge the urgent need to change.
