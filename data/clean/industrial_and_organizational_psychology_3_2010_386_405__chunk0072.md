# Methodological traditions

JDM primarily uses well-crafted lab experiments or ‘‘paper’’

simulations involving undergraduate students as subjects. These designs are internally valid and allow for better comparison of ﬁndings across studies. IOOB places greater emphasis on context and external validity and tends to use ﬁeld studies involving employees as subjects. The two methodological approaches should be viewed as complementary. It is often difﬁcult to get lab research or simulations using undergraduate students published in IOOB journals, which is unfortunate. IOOB should be much more open to lab research because such research allows for stronger causal conclusions than correlational ﬁeld studies and because the theoriesoften generalize to applied issues.
