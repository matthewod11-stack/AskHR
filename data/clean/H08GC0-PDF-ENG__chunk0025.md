# to higher burnout.

“During the pandemic organizations showed employees what they

could do when the rubber hit the road and change was required,” says

Rachel Thomas, CEO and cofounder of LeanIn.org. “Today, women are

witnessing a reversal and they’re saying, we don’t want to go backward,

we want to go forward. Women no longer think that prioritizing one’s

personal life and being ambitious and being deeply committed to work

are somehow antithetical,” Thomas told me.

Could this explain why the growth in women’s representation among

all senior leadership positions in the U.S. dropped to the lowest rate

in more than a decade? Or could it be a result of 2022 data from

Lean In that shows that for every woman at the director level who

gets promoted to the next level, two women directors are choosing

to leave their company? S&P Global Market Intelligence found that in

the C-suite, women lost seats for the ﬁrst time over the study period

(2005-2023). They now only hold 11% of the over 15,000 CEO seats of

publicly-traded companies in the U.S. With women continuing to make

only incremental gains in executive and C-level positions, it’s time we

recognize that work isn’t working for women. And toxic productivity

isn’t helping.
