views and feelings during job and performance appraisals’; ‘I have had influence over the pay decisions arrived at based on the job and performance appraisals’; ‘The job and performance appraisals have been conducted consistently’; ‘Pay decisions have been free of bias’; ‘Pay decisions have been based on accurate information’; ‘I have been able to appeal the pay decisions arrived at based on the job and performance appraisals’; and ‘Pay decisions upheld ethical and moral standards’. A five-point Likert scale ( from 1 = I completely disagree to 5 = I completely agree) was used. The coefficient alpha was .87.

Pay comparison: the respondents were asked to evaluate to what degree they compared their pay to several internal and external targets on a five-point scale (cf. Sweeney and McFarlin, 2004). The external target items were: ‘pay of colleagues in different organizations with a similar degree’, ‘pay of colleagues in different organizations with a similar degree’, ‘pay of the same jobs outside organization’, ‘union pay criteria’, and ‘pay of spouse or closely related’. The coefficient alpha was .80. The internal target items were: ‘pay criteria of the current system’, ‘pay of the fellow workers inside the organization’, and ‘pay in the former system’. The items were measured with 5-point scale ranging from 1 = Little if at all to 5 = A great extent. The coefficient alpha was .60.

Access to pay information: a modified version of The Base Pay Knowledge Scale introduced in Mulvey, Le Blanc, Heneman and McInerney (2002) was used to measure experienced knowledge of base pay. The respondent was asked to evaluate how well she/he knew the pay system on a scale consisting of eight items: ‘I know the grade of my job’, ‘I understand the rationale for my job being placed in its grade’, ‘I understand how my base pay changes are determined’, ‘I understand how my pay grade is determined’, ‘I understand how my performance objectives relate to the success of the whole organization’, ‘I understand the key measures of my performance’, ‘I understand how my performance is measured’, and ‘I know the influence my performance has on my base pay level’. A five-point Likert scale (form 1 = I completely disagree to 5 = I completely agree) was used. The coefficient alpha was .86.

Moderator variable: gender (men n1=251; women n2=204) was used to predict the relationships between pay inequity and organizational commitment as well as procedural justice and organizational commitment.

Organizational commitment: the strength of organizational commitment was measured by three items introduced by Klein (2008): ‘How committed are you to your organization?’, ‘How dedicated are you to your organization?’, and ‘To what extent do you feel bound to the future of the organization?’ The items were measured with 5- point scale ranging from 1 = Little if at all to 5 = A great extent. The coefficient alpha was .92.
