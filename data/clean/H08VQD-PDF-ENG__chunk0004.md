## nothing while your mind wanders and thinks about, for example, big

questions of meaning in your life. What does my life mean? You go to

uncomfortable existential questions when you’re bored.

That turns out to be incredibly important, incredibly good. One of the

reasons we have such an explosion of depression and anxiety in our

society today is because people actually don’t know the meaning of

their lives, much less so in previous generations. Tons of data show this,

and furthermore, we’re not even looking. Why not?
