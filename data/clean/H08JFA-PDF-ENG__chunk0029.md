# Practice “micro-mastery.”

You might feel tempted to say yes to every opportunity that comes your

way, believing that all experience is good experience. While that might

be true sometimes, irrelevant experience should not come at the cost

of relevant experience. Micro-mastery is focusing on excelling in one or

two speciﬁc small areas of your role (tasks or opportunities), instead of

saying yes to everything.
