# agreement in the literature about these three components of “motivation” (eg: Korman

1974, Kanfer, 1990), the nature and place of motivation in a work-related context has

and produce low quality work. On the other hand, employees who feel motivated to

work are likely to be persistent, creative and productive, turning out high quality work
