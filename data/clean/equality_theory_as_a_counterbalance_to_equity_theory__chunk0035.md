# Internal Labor Markets

Equal opportunity for career choice and career advance- ment is a classic hallmark of democracy; American cultural mythology embraces the egalitarian possibility of pro- gressing from a ‘‘log cabin’’ or working class background to the country’s highest position of responsibility. Yet in most organizations, the career paths of blue collar and so- called lower level workers have traditionally been isolated from the paths of managers and others with college degrees. In contrast to this, some organizations claim to have strong internal labor markets (Osterman 2001; Tac- hibanaki 1988). For example, at Nordstrom department stores, even those with advanced degrees start on the sales ﬂoor; promotion is strictly from within (Pfeffer 1994).

At ﬁrst glance, equality of opportunity may appear to differ from other types of outcomes treated under the rubric of distributive equality. Yet the ‘‘equality of opportunity’’ such as created by strong internal labor markets is explic- itly mentioned by Rawls (1971, 2001) as a major facet of distributive justice. Rawls states that ‘‘ofﬁces and positions must be open to everyone under conditions of fair equality of opportunity,’’ and travels further, stating that ‘‘if ofﬁces are distributed on the basis of merit that all must have reasonable opportunity to acquire the skills on the basis of which merit is assessed’’ (1971, p. 72). Said another way, even when advancement opportunity explicitly exists, implicit constraints (i.e., a glass ceiling) may limit effective use of such opportunity for certain employee segments.

Women present a particularly salient example in that institutionalized norms are not gender neutral (Fraser 1997,
