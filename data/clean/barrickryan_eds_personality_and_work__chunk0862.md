# 312 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Cross-Cultural Issues When personality measures are developed in one language, trans- lated, and used cross-culturally, construct equivalence is critically im- portant. Most of the research addresses the extent to which the factor structure of the personality inventory replicates in different languages and cultures. A review of the evidence indicates that for most of the well-known inventories, the same or similar structures are found cross- culturally; however, relatively little evidence exists regarding the gen- eralizability of criterion-related validities of personality variables across cultures (Paunonen & Ashton, 1998). (For a review of the many is- sues involved in cross-cultural measurement, see Church, 2001.)

Instructions to Test Takers Studies of the effects of intentional distortion on validity often involve instructions to test takers, for example, “Respond honestly” or “Re- spond in a way to maximize your chances of being hired as a sales- person.” Many think that the motivation to portray oneself favorably on a self-report personality inventory in an applicant setting results in lower validity (criterion-related and construct validity) of person- ality scales, an example of the situation moderating validity. The sit- uation does moderate validity, but not in a way often thought.

When validities of personality scales are examined according to applicant versus incumbent versus directed faking settings, va- lidity is approximately the same in applicant (motivated) and in- cumbent (honest) settings, but dramatically lower when test takers are instructed to fake, that is, directed faking studies (Hough, 1998a; Hough & Furnham, 2003). Another example of instructions to test takers that affects responses (reduces the amount of distor- tion) is informing or warning test takers that distorted responses can be detected and that consequences exist for such distortion (Dwight & Donovan, 1998). Another type of instruction to test tak- ers that can affect responses is informing people of the character- istic being measured (Kleinmann, Kuptsch, & Köler, 1996). Our models need to be sensitive to instructions to test takers as an in- dependent variable that can affect dependent variables.

New, Promising Methods Several approaches to measuring personality characteristics have emerged in terms of content measured and mode of measurement
