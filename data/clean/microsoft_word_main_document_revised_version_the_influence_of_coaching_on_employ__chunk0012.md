## 4.1 Research design and data collection procedure

The hypothesis was tested using a non-experimental design. Two purposive samples consisting of salespeople from two different companies were invited to participate in the study. Sample 1 consisted of business-to-business salespersons from a variety of industries (Oil & Gas, Telecommunications, Abrasives, etc.) working at a Latin American branch of a large American industrial manufacturer. Sample 2 consisted of frontline employees (Financial Advisors and Financial Planners) from a large business-to-consumer, financial services organization in Canada.

Previous research on coaching also used non-experimental designs and purposive samples (Agarwal et al., 2009; Ellinger et al., 2003, 2005; Onyemah, 2009; Tr√©panier, 2010; Pousa, 2012; Pousa and Mathieu, 2014). This is an undisputable choice, considering that coaching is a managerial behavior that takes years to be learned and developed, and it cannot be easily replicated in laboratory settings. For this study, the companies were selected because both

had implemented coaching programs several years ago, and managers had been coaching their subordinates for many years on a regular basis. At the time of the study, no other factors that could affect performance (e.g.: additional training, sales promotions, changes in the remuneration structures) were under consideration or implementation by any of the companies.

The two companies were initially contacted by the researchers, and they agreed to participate by allowing their salespersons to voluntarily complete the questionnaire in office time and by providing the working e-mails of these individuals. A contact person was also appointed in each of the companies to make the proper introductions.

Potential respondents from the two participating companies received an introductory e-mail from the corresponding contact person. Following this initial contact, they received a mail from one of the researchers inviting them to complete a web-based survey hosted in a secured site. In this mail, the academic aspects of the research were emphasized, as well as the confidentiality of all the information provided by the participants. A second follow-up mail was sent two weeks later to remind them to complete the survey.
