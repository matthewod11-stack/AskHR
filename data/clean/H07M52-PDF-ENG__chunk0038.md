One example comes from Abigail Posner, director, creative works at

Google. A creative team’s morale initially sank when its clients weren’t

acting on the team’s written strategic recommendations for their

advertising campaigns. The advertisers struggled to envision how the

changes could help.

The team leader was known for celebrating diﬀerences, however,

which opened up the opportunity for one person with a ﬁlmmaking

background to jump in and create a mock YouTube ad that incorporated

the recommended changes. Then a former journalist volunteered to

craft sales materials for the new ad. Combining these talents allowed

the team to present their recommendations in a way that was more

resonant for their clients, which resulted in greater client value,
