many devices for cardiovascular procedures designed to work in arteries

can be adapted to work in veins. But diﬀerences between arteries and

veins, such as the veins’ larger size and lower pressure, increase the

risk of signiﬁcant health complications. Those risks could be mitigated

with devices designed explicitly for venous use, but developing a single product for veins may not grow proﬁts relative to R&D costs suﬃciently

to merit development. If a series of venous devices were developed,

however, a sales force could sell them as a bundle and realize economies

of scale. Such synergistic innovations are often left unrealized because

companies and VCs continue to approach innovation from polarized
