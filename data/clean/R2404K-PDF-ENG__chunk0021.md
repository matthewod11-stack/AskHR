## In the ﬁrst stage corporate decision-makers and their investment

partners target the middle of the innovation stream: the opportunities

that fall between the incremental innovations favored for corporate

R&D and the transformative innovations pursued by venture capital.

Two types of innovations fall in this space: augmented and synergistic.

Augmented innovations signiﬁcantly improve upon, but do not

displace, existing products. They go beyond incremental innovations,

which aim to maintain customer interest in a product line, to devise

products that are signiﬁcantly better in terms of cost or functionality,

helping companies capture substantial market share or obtain footholds

in new markets. For example, in the medical technology ﬁeld, eﬀorts to

treat cardiovascular disease have focused on blood ﬂow in the arteries,

resulting in technologies (stents, balloons, and catheters, for example)

designed for that anatomy. One such device is a drug-eluting balloon,

which is inserted into an artery and releases medication to reduce

blockages that impede blood ﬂow. A successful start-up by one of us

(Duke) designed a balloon that was both cheaper and more eﬀective

than others on the market. That was an augmented innovation.

Synergistic innovations are new products that derive value from

their adjacency to existing products. The ﬁrm can bundle the new

product into its existing sales, marketing, and manufacturing processes.

Synergistic products are often “innovation orphans”: Their value

propositions are not high enough to attract VC investment, but their risk

is perceived to be too high for internal R&D investment. For example,
