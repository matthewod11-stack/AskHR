Maslow’s Needs Hierarchy Perhaps the most famous theory of motivation was developed by Abraham Maslow (, ). Maslow believed that employees would be motivated by and satisfied with their jobs at any given point in time if certain needs were met. As Table . shows, Maslow believed that there are five major types of needs and that these needs are hierarchical—that is, lower-level needs must be satisfied before an individual will be concerned with the next level of needs. It is helpful to look at a hierarchy as if it were a staircase that is climbed one step at a time until the top is reached. The same is true of Maslow’s hierar- chy. Each level is taken one step at a time, and a higher-level need cannot be reached until a lower-level need is satisfied. Maslow’s five major needs are dis- cussed next.

Basic Biological Needs. Maslow thought that an individual first seeks to satisfy basic biological needs for food, air, water, and shelter. In our case, an individual who does not have a job, is homeless, and is on the verge of starvation will be sat- isfied with any job as long as it provides for these basic needs. When asked how well they enjoy their job, people at this level might reply, “I can’t complain, it pays the bills.”

Safety Needs. After basic biological needs have been met, a job that merely pro- vides food and shelter will no longer be satisfying. Employees then become con- cerned about meeting their safety needs. That is, they may work in an unsafe coal mine to earn enough money to ensure their family’s survival, but once their family has food and shelter, they will remain satisfied with their jobs only if the workplace is safe.
