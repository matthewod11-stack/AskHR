# Data analysis

The obtained data were analyzed with SPSS 19.0. Means, standard deviations, intraclass corre- lation coefficients, and bivariate correlations among variables under investigation were calcu- lated to meet the first aim. Intraclass correlation coefficients for the different subscales ranged between .08 and .58, indicating the need for multilevel analysis for comparisons between groups to meet the second, third and fourth aims. Therefore, we followed the recommenda- tions of Heck et al. [47] to calculate multivariate multilevel models for correlated outcome var- iables with mixed models (see chapter 7, pp. 247–268). We performed one model for each research question. The models were built to examine the differences in outcome variables for teams having different leadership structures (i.e., zero, one, two, or three task leaders) with fixed effects to control differences between athletes and with random effects to calculate vari- ances for outcome variables and covariance between outcome variables [48]. First, we created a variable to include all the outcomes and included it as dependent variable. We also created a categorical variable (called index) to identify each outcome variable (coded from 1 to 9). Sec- ondly, we described leadership groups (e.g., task leader), index, and leadership groups � index interaction as fixed effects. Thirdly, we included the random effects of index at the team level. The model showed instability at the team level (i.e., random effects), and the parameter of covariance, the test statistic, and the confidence interval could not be calculated. This is likely due to the small sample size for the second level (i.e., 31 teams) and therefore, the model tends to encounter convergence problems, as the variance for the between-level parameters tends to be small [42]. As a result, for comparisons between different groups (zero, one, two, or three leaders), Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used with subsequent Bonferroni post-hoc analyses to simplify the models. Furthermore, Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons were used in all cases. It should be noted that the results obtained in the fixed effects of the mixed models and in the MANOVA were similar.
