# Results Preliminary analysis

We ran a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for each scale. Data offered support for the factor structure of the variables under investigation, showing acceptable model fit for role clarity (χ2 = 149.434; df = 51; p < .001; CFI = .96; TLI = .95; RMSEA = .05; SRMR = .02), role conflict (χ2 = 19.75; df = 9; p < .001; CFI = .98; TLI = .98; RMSEA = .04; SRMR = .02), team conflict (χ2 = 129.70; df = 48; p < .001; CFI = .97; TLI = .96; RMSEA = .05; SRMR = .03), collective effi- cacy (χ2 = 19.07; df = 9; p = .02; CFI = .98; TLI = .98; RMSEA = .04; SRMR = .02), and intention to continue (χ2 = 7.25; df = 2; p = .007; CFI = .97; TLI = .90; RMSEA = .10; SRMR = .03). Fur- thermore, all scales had acceptable internal consistency (α < .70) [49], with the exception of
