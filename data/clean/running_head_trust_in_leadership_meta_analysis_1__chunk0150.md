# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

transformational leaders are more concerned with advancing organisational objectives (Bass,

2000). The findings reinforce the view that studies should adopt multidimensional measures

to tease out which form of trust is more important in creating desirable consequences and

which leadership styles are most likely to facilitate that trust. When studies choose to adopt

overall measures of trust, these nuances may be missed.

Turning to our mediation analysis, affective trust and LMX quality jointly explained

the indirect effects of leadership styles with outcomes whereas cognitive trust did not explain

the relationship in the expected direction. Interestingly, affective trust explains a larger

proportion of the indirect effects between all leadership styles and OCB. This is supportive of

the argument that affective trust most accurately captures features of the social exchange

relationship by evoking sentiments such as commitment and intrinsic significance (Colquitt et

al., 2014). As discretionary behaviour, OCB represents important SET currency (Lee et al.,

- 2019) that is especially useful in maintaining balanced exchanges (e.g., Ilies et al., 2007).

Finally, the negative indirect effects found for cognitive trust are likely indicative of a

suppression effect. According to Cohen and Cohen (1983), a suppression effect occurs

whenever one of the three possible pair-wise correlations among these three variables is less

than the product of the other two. The suppression effect likely comes from the

multicollinearity between the bases of trust, LMX and the leadership variables. For instance,

a high correlation (p = .77) was observed between cognitive and affective trust (see Table 6).
