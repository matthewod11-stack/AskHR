that other factors “account for a very large part of the variation in ratings” (p. 265).

Guion (1983) critiqued Hunter’s model (1983), concluding that “although Hunter has found some validity for ratings, he has not found much” (p. 269). Guion suggested that the model should be enlarged to include characteristics of ratees (appearance, an- noyance syndrome, frequency of communication with a supervi- sor, and interpersonal skill), characteristics of raters (bigotry, cognitive complexity, and leadership roles), and context variables (level of peer performance, quality of equipment and material, and incentives).

Nonetheless, the next major addition to the causal model was job experience (opportunity to learn). Schmidt, Hunter, and Out- erbridge (1986) added this variable to their causal model of the determinants of performance, ﬁnding it had a role similar to cog- nitive ability: an indirect effect on supervisory ratings of job per- formance through its direct effect on both job knowledge and work sample performance.
