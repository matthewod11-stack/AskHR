# something else.

Third, eﬀective reviews require a judgment about causes of a person’s

performance. For example, are performance issues the consequence

of deﬁciencies in motivation or ability? Some people may work hard,

but lack certain capabilities: Can training and coaching enhance those

capabilities? Others may have the abilities but lack motivation: Can

diﬀerent incentives or processes increase motivation? Still others may

seemingly lack both motivation and relevant ability: Is this the right

job for that person? Can a performance improvement plan help, or a

diﬀerent role where their abilities can be better utilized? Or is it time to

replace this person?

Finally, stars often have both high motivation and ability: What can be

done to reward, retain and learn from the stars’ behaviors?

These are not easy judgments to make about human beings. But they’re necessary and imply diﬀerent action plans. Without them, it’s diﬃcult

to be mutually productive during the review.
