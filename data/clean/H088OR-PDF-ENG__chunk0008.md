## HBR / Digital Article / Hybrid Work Has Changed Meetings Forever

While meeting ineﬃciency was certainly an issue before the pandemic,

it should be no surprise that the sudden switch to virtual collaboration

exacerbated the problem. However, that switch had a beneﬁcial side eﬀect: virtual meetings produce data. At today’s scale, that data holds

meaningful insights — touching on productivity, engagement, and even

retention — and can be applied in a variety of beneﬁcial ways. For

organizations looking to improve their meeting culture, collaboration

data is a valuable but largely untapped resource.

At Vyopta — a monitoring and analytics platform for enterprise

collaboration — we work directly with companies to help them realize

value from their meeting data. Additionally, using a large dataset, we

routinely analyze global collaboration metrics to establish benchmarks

and identify signiﬁcant trends. This article will cover key insights from a recent analysis and oﬀer examples of how organizations have used

data to improve their meetings.
