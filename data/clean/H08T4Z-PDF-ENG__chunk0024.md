Have you mastered your emotions?

Without emotional regulation, it’s hard to get the economics right. The

hardest part of quitting isn’t inconsistent cash ﬂow but the constant

self-doubt, imposter syndrome, and loneliness. Your emotions can

wreak havoc on your pricing by causing you to undervalue your product or service and oﬀer discounts before a customer even asks.

Nick Bennett teaches other solopreneurs how to make the leap, by

providing concrete strategies to scale but also coaching to manage all

the negative voices and emotions. When Nick was building his business,

he realized that running with others on the same journey was crucial.

He built a text thread with three other entrepreneurs that eventually

grew to a Slack channel of over 50. While he was successful in his

coaching and consulting, he realized the power of community and saw

an opportunity to meaningfully raise his price vis-a-vis his time. He and his partner created an oﬀer that generated $30,000 in one weekend.
